?	O
What	BESE
would	IESE
then	IESE
remain	IESE
of	O
the	O
universal	BESE
character	IESE
of	IESE
the	IESE
prophets	IESE
of	O
Israel	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
Isaiah	O
,	O
for	O

and	O
of	O
Israeli	O

'	O
hope	BDSE

one	O
day	O
living	BESE
in	IESE
peace	IESE
in	O
this	O

?	O
The	BESE
other	IESE
solution	IESE
is	IESE
the	IESE
opposite	IESE
of	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
the	O
Israelis	O
to	O
more	BESE
hospitable	IESE
climes	IESE
,	O
in	O
the	O
United	O

or	O
Europe	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
absolutely	BESE
impossible	IESE
for	O
the	O
time	O
being	O
.	O
But	BESE
in	IESE
the	IESE
future	IESE
?	O
What	BESE
would	IESE
remain	IESE
of	IESE
the	IESE
ideals	IESE
of	BDSE
those	O
who	O
saw	BDSE
themselves	O
as	O
their	O
liberators	BESE
of	O
their	O

and	O
as	O

?	O
Asking	BESE
this	IESE
question	IESE
at	IESE
least	IESE
serves	IESE
as	IESE
a	IESE
reminder	IESE
that	O
,	O
although	BESE
many	O
have	O
already	O
left	O
,	O
thereby	O
reinventing	O
the	O
Diaspora	O
,	O
the	O
Israelis	O
want	BDSE
to	O
stay	O
and	O
do	BDSE
not	IDSE
intend	IDSE
to	O
end	BESE
up	IESE
like	IESE
French	IESE
Algeria	IESE
.	O
The	BESE
third	IESE
solution	IESE
consists	O
of	O
coexistence	O
,	O
whether	BESE
it	O
takes	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
two	O
separate	O
states	O
or	O
a	O
federation	O
or	O
a	O
confederation	O

Two	O
basic	O
principles	O
could	BESE
still	IESE
,	IESE
perhaps	IESE
,	O
make	O
it	O
possible	BESE
.	O
The	O
first	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
not	BESE
only	IESE
civic	IESE
,	IESE
but	IESE
also	IESE
social	IESE
and	IESE
economic	IESE
,	IESE
equality	IESE
.	O
This	O
principle	O
applies	BESE
primarily	IESE
to	O
the	O
attitudes	BDSE
that	O
must	BESE
prevail	IESE
during	O
any	BESE
future	O
negotiations	O
.	O
It	O
also	O
applies	O
for	O
Palestinian	O
citizens	O
of	O
Israel	O
who	O
,	O
53	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
,	O
are	O
still	BESE
far	IESE
from	IESE
equal	IESE
.	O
It	O
furthermore	BESE
holds	O
for	O
the	O
Israelis	O
who	O
decide	BDSE
to	O
remain	O
in	O
Palestinian	O
territory	O
and	O
who	O
must	BESE
no	IESE
longer	IESE
be	IESE
encysted	IESE
there	O
.	O
The	O
second	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
reciprocity	BESE
.	O
Any	BESE
renunciation	IESE
of	BDSE
sovereignty	O
by	O
either	O
party	O
must	BESE
be	O
compensated	O
by	O
the	O

of	BESE

Fourth	O
is	O
the	O
contrast	O
between	O

and	O
the	O
Belgian	O
Government	O
's	O
absolute	O

on	O

within	O
the	O
framework	O
of	O
the	O
Kyoto	O

.	O
Since	O
industry	O
does	BDSE
not	IDSE
wish	IDSE
to	O
let	O
itself	O
be	O
pinned	BESE
down	IESE
on	O
an	O
absolute	O
emissions	O
ceiling	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
government	O
feels	BDSE
itself	IDSE
committed	IDSE
to	O
an	O
absolute	O
ceiling	O
,	O
industry	O
is	O
foisting	BESE
the	O
necessary	O
efforts	O
onto	O
other	O
sectors	O
in	O
society	O
through	O
the	O
benchmark	O
covenants	O
.	O
If	BESE
industrial	O
greenhouse	O
gas	O
emissions	O
increase	O
considerably	O
over	O
the	O
next	O
10	O
years	O
,	O
that	O
will	BESE
have	IESE
to	IESE
be	IESE
offset	O
by	O
a	O
commensurate	O
reduction	O
of	O
emissions	O
in	O
the	O
transport	O
sector	O
,	O
services	O
,	O
households	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

Thus	BESE
the	O
benchmark	O
covenants	O
could	BESE
have	IESE
very	IESE
significant	IESE
consequences	IESE
for	O
other	O
sectors	O
and	O
target	O

in	O
our	O
society	O

whereas	O
the	O
latter	O
are	O
not	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
deliberations	BDSE
on	O
those	O

Hence	BESE
a	O
broad	O
social	O
debate	BDSE
on	O
who	O
should	O
contribute	O
how	O
much	O
to	O
realizing	O
the	O
Kyoto	O

is	O
urgently	BESE
necessary	IESE
.	O
Despite	BESE
these	IESE
shortcomings	IESE
,	O
we	O
believe	BDSE
that	O
a	O
role	O
is	O
reserved	O
for	O
the	O
instrument	O
of	O
benchmark	O

.	O
Thus	O
the	O
benchmark	O

could	BESE
be	IESE
reconciled	IESE
with	O
the	O
European	O
Commission	O

launching	O
a	O

for	O

This	O

obtain	O

to	O
emit	O
a	O
certain	O

is	O
hence	BESE
irreconcilable	BESE
at	IESE

with	O
the	O

However	BESE
