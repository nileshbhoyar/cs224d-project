VThus a flat tax is fairer as it equalized the basis on which everyone pays for access to equal services , and prevents a poorer majority from victimizing a wealthier minority through punitive rates of income tax for the wealthy , which may cause them to flee the country for other states with less taxation .
p752
sV17852_2_4
p753
VSecondly this removes the ability of the majority of a population to engage in what the French economist Bastiat called ` legalized plunder ' , where they -LRB- as the majority of voters -RRB- assign higher percentages of income tax to the wealthy in order that the state may appropriate and redistribute it to them for their own use .
p754
sV17852_2_5
p755
VWith a flat tax in place , there would be no ability for anyone to vote for a tax rise simply on other people and not on themselves , and thus such policies would receive more consideration and not be used by the majority simply to appropriate the property of others through the law .
p756
sV17852_2_2
p757
VHowever , this parity can be achieved by everyone paying the same percentage of their income in tax to the government , and this is exactly what a flat tax is , and so equality in contribution to government services -LRB- mirroring equality in access to government services -RRB- is achieved .
p758
sV17852_2_3
p759
VThis principle of equality is important for two reasons : firstly , if wealthier citizens feel they are being unfairly burdened by the current requirement that they pay higher percentages of their income to fund government services than those on lower incomes , they may feel a disincentive to work hard -LRB- which creates wealth for the whole economy -RRB- , or may even be driven abroad to states with lower rates of taxation or to tax havens .

VThis causes a number of problems .
p777
sV17852_1_0
p778
VThe current system of ` progressive ' taxation whereby higher earners are taxed a higher percentage of their income requires the identification and administration of multiple different tax brackets spanning the entire spectrum of earnings in a nation .
p779
sV17852_1_3
p780
VMoreover , the administration of multiple tax brackets is incredibly complicated and difficult , requiring every taxpayer to record their income and expenditure -LRB- in order to try and qualify for tax exemptions and ` loopholes ' -RRB- in meticulous detail and then to properly express this on lengthy and complicated government forms , a process which can cause anger , frustration and alienation amongst taxpayers .
p781
sV17852_1_2
p782
VThe brackets themselves may be largely arbitrary cut-off lines based around round numbers , with no real justification as to why one person increasing their earnings by as little as 1000 should lead to them suddenly being propelled to a new tax bracket , when the actual difference to their income is negligible in overall terms .
p783
sV17852_1_5
p784
VThis may be contrasted with a flat tax system by taking the example of taxes on salaries paid to employees by a company under both systems .
p785
sV17852_1_4
p786
VIn order to try and prevent tax evasion , governments are consequently compelled to have large bureaucracies that oversee this process and comb through looking for fraud , a costly and lengthy process .
p787
sV17852_1_7
p788
VHowever , under a flat tax , a tax collector could simply withhold the fixed flat tax rate -LRB- for example 20 % -RRB- of the total company 's payroll without needing to know what was paid to whom , as every pound is taxed at the same rate and thus it does not matter what goes to whom .
p789
sV17852_1_6
p790
VIn the status quo , a tax collector must be aware in detail of exactly what is being paid to whom in order to ensure that everyone declares their income truthfully , allowing them to be placed in the correct bracket .

VTax credits , deductions and loopholes distort resource allocation in a market situation because people respond to the differing tax rates and so put more resources into the areas which the loopholes apply to than they would otherwise .
p808
sV17852_0_1
p809
VFor example , current tax credits for investment mean that more resources go into investment than they would in the absence of that credit , as the returns on the placing of resources in this area are higher than others -LRB- as it is subject to a lower rate of tax -RRB- .
p810
sV17852_0_2
p811
VA government may even set certain tax credits and loopholes which favour certain industries or economic sectors , such as agriculture , on the basis that this is politically useful -LRB- in winning votes -RRB- , when this again distorts resource allocation in the economy .
p812
sV17852_0_3
p813
VThese distortions may prove harmful as they cause certain sectors to be over-valued or over-invested in due to their favourable tax status , to the detriment and neglect of other more highly-taxed areas -LRB- for example , manufacturing -RRB- which may in fact be the more economically sound .
p814
