the sessions Practically ignores everything about O'Brien 's life except as it relates to his sexual odyssey , turning the life of the man into little more than a curio . The Sessions is bracing . It 's also one of the few movies to recognize that people with severe physical disabilities have sexual lives , too . Ben Lewin 's The Sessions is an emotionally charged film with a smart sense of humor that 'll have you tearing up from equal doses of laughter and drama . Lewin , who has fought his own lifelong polio battle , handles tricky material with a gentle , empathetic touch . May sound like shameless Oscar-bait , but in truth the film is simpler than that , more small-scale , with a light and unpretentious sense of humor . You could maybe see it working as a play , though the tactile detail of these scenes needs close-ups on the actors ' faces to communicate what the transaction means to them both . All thinking viewers will come away with a better understanding as to how the seemingly different amongst us are really just the one-in-the-same when getting up close and personal . A genuinely touching , if slight drama , the movie remains a sympathetic portrait of the plight of a handicapped person without ever growing too serious or saccharine . ( ... ) a remarkable film about disability , incapacity and the joy of freedom in the most impossible of situations . John Hawkes does the kind of acting that awards were invented for in this exhilarating gift of a movie that 's funny , touching and vital . 	Tender , funny , and touching , The Sessions provides an acting showcase for its talented stars and proves it 's possible for Hollywood to produce a grown-up movie about sex .
megamind Megamind is a blast . Take your kids . Stay with them . There are plenty of laughs for everyone . Bring your asprin for the 3D headache . `` Megamind '' is a genial animated sendup of superhero flicks that should appeal to kids around the age when they 're getting a bit cynical about do-gooders in capes and tights . May be worth seeing , but interested viewers would do well to either find a theater showing it in two dimensions or just wait for the inevitably superior Blu-Ray release . In its attempt to spoof the superhero genre , Megamind just may be too smart for its own good . It 's all borrowed : the characters , the plot , the predictable `` bad '' tunes . Even Megamind 's ensembles look to have been raided from Maleficent 's closet . Not so Mega , but rather , Mild . Megamind is perfectly fine for the kids , but adults might find their own megaminds wandering at various points throughout a film that does n't compare to The Incredibles when it comes to affectionately tweaking the superhero genre . ... 'Well , that was fun . A lot better than I expected . ' An assessment with which this reviewer can concur . In a sort of backhanded answer to Pixar 's The Incredibles ( and I mean that in a positive way ) , DreamWorks hits yet another animated adventure out of the park . Megamind is clever , fast-paced and fun , and looks fantastic in 3D . Is n't exactly groundbreaking , but it 's good , clean fun . Megamind is largely what one might expect from an animated movie featuring a number of notable comedians in voice roles : an amusing diversion . 	It regurgitates plot points from earlier animated efforts , and is n't quite as funny as it should be , but a top-shelf voice cast and strong visuals help make Megamind a pleasant , if unspectacular , diversion .
the rocket An extremely rewarding and entertaining film made all the stronger for the integrity and cultural details that underpin it . The particulars of Laos 's historical conflicts are sometimes only obliquely confronted , but the torrid past of covered-up wars palpably echoes through the scarred yet majestic landscapes . This utterly charming , fable-like coming of age tale will live longer in the hearts and minds of audiences . The Rocket is a well-constructed delivery system for sparkly cheer , but it lacks a more substantial payload . Try not to fall off the edge of your seat during the film 's nail-biting final scenes . Long on atmosphere and less sentimental about poverty than `` Beasts of the Southern Wild , '' the film carries a potent charge of authenticity . Disamoe demonstrates the resourcefulness he learned during a period when he was a street seller and beggar . It 's his exuberant performance , as much as the pungently naturalistic setting , that lifts The Rocket 's scenario above the generic . A simple but charming , affecting and thought-provoking story , rich in atmosphere and local history , and beautifully acted by its young leads . One of the most exotic coming-of-age movies you 're likely to see . A powerful , deeply moving drama about a young boy who comes to terms with the tragedies that have befallen his family by creating a thing of beauty - a gorgeous , high-flying rocket emitting triumphant bursts of color - out of refuse left by the war . 	A feel-good success crafted with care , Kim Mordaunt 's story of two young kids in Laos is a heartfelt audience pleaser while remaining sensitive toward its subjects .
jackie brown An unconventional crime caper adapted from an Elmore Leonard story about double-crosses and gun smuggling . A surprisingly mediocre movie . Overall , Tarantino has made an acceptable film , even if it is over two and a half hours long . [ A ] flawed but stylish and moderately entertaining crime thriller . A damn-near flawless little piece of film noir , filled with excellent characterization , and just the right bit of hipness . Pulp Fiction is a hard film to top , but Tarantino has done it , with great flair , style and sheer cinematic genius . Mellower Tarantino still has sex , drugs , swearing , murder . A leisurely and easygoing diversion that goes down easy enough but is far from compelling . A much moodier , slower pace from Tarantino 's other work , but Jackie Brown is one enjoyable flick that rewards its audience with each viewing . That this modest crime thriller ca n't quite live up to its audacious dance across so many strata of hip and hommage and self-referential cool it makes your head spin is hardly a surprise , or even a criticism . 	Tarantino 's third film , fashioned as a comeback vehicle for star Pam Grier , offers typical wit and charm -- and is typically overstuffed .
tony takitani Jun Ichikawa 's quiet film has a power that resonates . It gives loneliness a cinematic canvas . This is the sort of film you 're pretty sure you wo n't like , but see anyway out of vague curiosity and emerge from its spell somehow changed . Tony Takitani runs only about 75 minutes but is so well and deftly crafted that it could n't be a minute more ... or less . It 's a marvelously moody meditation , beautiful to look at and beautiful to ponder as the camera slowly pans from one scene to the next , framing life as still life . This could reverently be called a model of minimalism , but I am more inclined to call it dull as dishwater . it 's a hypnotic mood piece on love and loss , one that knows -- at 75 minutes -- not to overstay its welcome . Though it falters as a narrative , Tony Takitani sticks in the mind with its poetic contemplativeness . Tony Takitani conveys a powerfully tangible sense of loss and loneliness . In both concrete and existential terms , it 's a film that dwells on what the dead leave behind and how the living carry on . Impressively reduces Murakami 's hard-boiled word world to a floating-picture world . But like Lish 's edits of Ray Carver , it mutes a story that was nearly mute to begin with . The characters and narrative are so lightly sketched , the film 's gravity sneaks up on the viewer through the gradual force of its form and rhythm . 	Despite its deceptive wispiness , this delicately lovely and melancholy film about loneliness has a haunting power .
rugrats in paris It does n't matter how weak the script is , Chuckie will win your heart every time he opens his mouth and speaks in that timid , nasal-dripping voice . You can bet on it . The Rugrats team has come up with a funny , smart and genuinely moving movie that will please children and adults . The first Rugrats film was a surprise hit ... and Rugrats in Paris -- The Movie cleverly stays the course . The Rugrats are back for an all-new adventure , and one that is by far much funnier and more entertaining for both youngsters and their guardians than the first bigscreen outing . More chic and movie-savvy than its predecessor . Predictable and not terribly clever . A very good kids ' movie from a grown-up standpoint -- it has a coherent plot , a good pace and well-defined characters , and a funny monster-movie spoof at the finale . The script is ... better than the first film or the Nickelodeon series . There 's something in Rugrats in Paris for all ages . It 's a good way to entertain kids for an hour without parents going insane . 	When the Rugrats go to Paris , the result is Nickelodeon-style fun . The plot is effectively character-driven , and features catchy songs and great celebrity voice-acting .
charlie st cloud It 's rare teenage audiences get the chance to clock a metaphysical mystery when they could be watching a vampire fight a werewolf for the hand of a sourpuss . Even at his lowest points Charlie appears ready to audition for a skin-care or Calvin Klein commercial . Where 's a vampire when you need one ? The surreal thing is , Zac Efron ca n't do despair . He plays it by staring . Blankly . And by not smiling . Blankly . Frequently tedious , badly written drama that fails to deliver the emotional punch it 's aiming for , thanks to a painfully obvious central twist that creates more problems than it resolves . Zac Efron is so pretty even dead people want to be his friend . He is noble . He is virtuous . He is often wet . This movie has all the elements of a Nicholas Sparks novel except for letters and logic . ... a sporadically watchable yet pervasively uneven teen-oriented drama that ultimately just does n't work ... If you liked Happy Zac in High School Musical , why not try Sad Zac ? All the chiselled sex appeal of the original , but now with a gloomy face on top ! 	Zac Efron gives it his all , but Charlie St . Cloud is too shallow and cloying to offer much more than eye candy for his fans .
sicario 2015 The first hour of this latest film from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is sleek , terrific pulp . An enthralling treatment of the war on the drug trade ... a brilliant , unsettling piece of filmmaking . Rather than bring the story to a boil , Villeneuve prefers to glide along it , even a slow zoom past a rock formation seeming to find muscles and a screaming face within . Pleasingly grown-up entertainment that pulls no punches . Sicario opens on a power chord of fear , nausea , and dread that resonates throughout the whole movie . Intelligent and provocative . Despite the heavy subject matter , Sicario works just as well as a thriller as it does a social-issue drama . Blunt plays the part splendidly . If you like your movies powerful and important , even cringe-inducing , this could be your choice . It proves that there is more to movies than escapism . This one is disturbing on a high-caliber level . Sicario looks so good that it 's impossible not to gush ... Basically just another violent movie about drug trafficking . It 's efficient enough at what it does , but what it does is neither new nor significant . 	Led by outstanding work from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro , Sicario is a taut , tightly wound thriller with much more on its mind than attention-getting set pieces .
the dog 2014 As a fascinating pop culture artifact , this film is hard to beat . Part of what makes Mr. Wojtowicz such a fascinating character is that he seemed to rotate identities as easily as other people change socks , and without angst . Working as both an unofficial Dog Day sequel and unconventional overview of New York gay culture from the past 40 years , The Dog combines archival footage , still photographs , and testaments from many of those who knew Wojtowicz well . [ Wojtowicz ] may be crazy and full of himself , but his magnetism is hypnotic , and it makes this modest documentary a delight from start to finish . As the moving , sad , riotously humorous documentary `` The Dog '' explains , the film only captures traces of Wojtowicz 's personality , and only tells bits of his story . Questions of identity reverberate through The Dog , a documentary by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren that chronicles Wojtowicz 's storied and terribly sad life . Wojtowicz is a publicity slut , plain and simple , but that 's clearly the darker side of this relatively even-tempered and rather unobjectionable documentary because it highlights the beginning of a modern phenomenon . At its best when Wojtowicz is unleashed A rich dessert served in a slightly too-hearty portion size , The Dog flirts with deeper truths about lives surrendered to the pursuit of fame but never totally punches through . The result does justice to their subject 's foul-mouthed charm and braggadocio . 	Fascinating , evocative , and as unconventional as its subject , The Dog offers a colorful window into the real-life story behind a classic film .
1093843-mansfield park ... busy nothings add up to motion picture somethings in one of the year 's most charming films . In this provocative , revisionist adaptation of Jane Austen 's third novel , Canadian writer-director Patricia Rozema gives her 19th century heroine , Fanny Price , much of Austen 's own confidant , creative personality . A gorgeous , enchanting experience . While Mansfield Park does n't boast the high calibre Hollywood star wattage and gloss of Sense and Sensibility , it offers a more thought-provoking viewpoint . With its gorgeous cinematography ... lovely muted score , and sure-footed performances , especially by Frances O'Connor , Patricia Rozema 's `` Mansfield Park '' sets a new standard for adaptations of Jane Austen 's work . This incarnation of Fanny may not have been what Austen had in mind , but she surely would have approved , for the injection of attitude and smarts makes Mansfield Park a much more wicked and irresistible social satire ... Park is damn entertaining . Rozema 's dry wit , effervescent dialogue and contemporary reinterpretations are often a refreshing change from the swoony , soft-peddling style of other Austen adaptations . Mansfield Park is a generally light and funny film which invites us to watch Fanny handle the coldness and pressure of her priggish relatives , and not only survive , but somehow prevail . Stifled and tedious adaptation of an Austen classic strips the heroine of her usual power of perception and tongue . 	Solid performances , bold direction .
revolutionary road So straight and formal there 's no room to breathe . In terms of performance and production , this is an undeniably high-quality affair . Yet it 's all rather superficial . It is good , not great , and it is the two stars that make this worth the price of admission . WITH all the talent , time and effort that has gone into making a movie like this , I hate reducing it to one word . But here goes . Revolutionary Road is ... AWFUL . Revolutionary Road is not a great film , per se ; a great film needs the stamp of a great director . But it is a great film of this great book . A gripping and harrowing dissection of two deluded souls . Hoplessly bleak and disturbingly detached , this dissection of a doomed marriage is saved by Kate Winslet 's formidable performance . The acting impresses , the plight of the characters , less rounded and sympathetic than they are in the book , merely depresses . Roadworthy then , but hardly revolutionary . A skillfully composed but gloomy affair that rigidly positions itself as a Serious Adult Drama of the feel-bad variety . ... a limp , facile condemnation of suburbia ( though in the interest of full disclosure , I moved from Chicago to the suburbs six years ago and happen to enjoy the extra trees . ) 	Brilliantly acted and emotionally powerful , Revolutionary Road is a handsome adaptation of Richard Yates ' celebrated novel .
jonah hex [ A ] dull and messy ride through supernatural Clint Eastwood territory . Jonah Hex is one big rush , but not in the positive sense . While Jonah Hex has its moments , it 's ultimately yet another disappointing comic book adaptation . Director Jimmy Hayward fails to establish a viable reason for this movie to exist . You wo n't be blown away but if it 's your thing , you will be entertained . A quintessential paycheck movie , made not because someone had a terrific vision for how to adapt the story but because a studio owned the rights and thought they could make some cash from it . It 's hard to have any thoughts while watching Jonah Hex -- the cranium-crushing soundtrack takes care of that . All I know is , the end could n't come fast enough . Darkman and The Quick and the Dead -- the two Sam Raimi films Jonah Hex most wants to be . Gives Hollywood an excuse not to make more Westerns , just as it 's bad for the future of graphic novel adaptations ... save your money and buy the trades . 	Josh Brolin gives it his best shot , but he ca n't keep the short , unfocused Jonah Hex from collapsing on the screen .
ghosts of cite soleil The tone of the movie is excessively in thrall to its admittedly charismatic subjects . A spectacularly turbulent portrait of the chaos and bloodshed that have come to define Haiti . Its apparent complexity is all visual patchwork . More horrific than any tale from the crypt Hollywood could conceive . This is as appalling , and viscerally compelling , a documentary as will be released all year . Dark , dreary , depressing documentary Consistently riveting thanks to the sense of sheer terror that infuses its best moments . Ghosts of Cite Soleil is too brief and limited in scope to provide a complete picture of Haiti 's turbulent history , but its images of how so many of its citizens live and die on a daily basis -- is both heartbreaking and unforgettable . This privileged-class filmmaker is so enamored of his romantically outlaw subjects and the woman in-between , his film is just one step removed from `` The Real World : Haiti . '' A moving and profoundly upsetting portrait of life near the bottom of the global power pyramid . 	Asger Leth risked his life to bring audiences this rare and gritty glimpse at Haitian gangs , poverty and politics .
out of africa Maybe the problem of the pacing is simply the nature of the beast these days with expensive period pieces . Once the difficult details are all in place , it may be too much to expect a director to resist milking every scene for more than it 's worth . A sumptuous romantic drama , Out of Africa spans continents and partners in while relating the tale of how Karen Blixen grew to become the world-famous author . Out of Africa is a great movie to look at , breathtakingly filmed on location . It is a movie with the courage to be about complex , sweeping emotions , and to use the star power of its actors without apology . Long and tedious at times , but Redford and Streep shine . It tells a grand love story in less-than-grand fashion but is nevertheless worth seeing because of all the other things it does right . Nominated for 11 Academy Awards , this earned seven , including Best Picture and Best Director ... but no Best Actress , alas . Meryl Streep trots out a classic performance in this 1985 Oscar-winner about Isak Dineson/Karen Blixen , a writer who lived in Africa for a short time and experienced all manner of adventure and heartache , dutifully recorded in this Sydney Pollack epic . Streep may convince us utterly that she is in love with Africa , but our views of it are a little too stately to really feel the place . Sydney Pollack applies craftsmanship and restraint to a classic plot curve of longing , fulfillment , and loss , and although the denouement is a bit overextended , he never yields to facile , insistent sentimentality -- his effects are honestly won . Out of Africa is a splendid example of that persistent genre , the coffeetable movie . It 's big , beautiful , and imposing . But there is n't much to it , and pretty pictures -- replacing ideas , not supporting them -- are its only real attraction . 	Though lensed with stunning cinematography and featuring a pair of winning performances from Meryl Streep and Robert Redford , Out of Africa suffers from excessive length and glacial pacing .
dead zone Brilliantly creepy Walken The classic Walken role , by which all subsequent ones are measured . Possibly the best Stephen King adaptation too . Spurred on by Christopher Walken 's sincerely moving and warm portrayal . A gripping thriller done with intelligence . One of the better film adaptations of Stephen King 's work . Despite the reputation of both Stephen King and director Cronenberg ( Videodrome , Scanners ) there is very little blood and gore in this film . The Dead Zone ultimately ranks as one of the best King adaptations to date . ... near perfect ... Chrisopher Walken gives a thoughtful performance as a psychic-in-spite-of-himself who must save the world from a mad politician . Cronenberg tells the story with measured strokes and a sure emotional touch as well as nifty blasts of horror . Arguably the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel . 	The Dead Zone combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations .
terminator Remains a surprisingly meditative work , its concentrated visceral bursts not unlike punctuation marks among something more brooding , even prayerful . The Terminator was James Cameron 's second film and remains his most crisply written in every respect . The Terminator ( 1984 ) , the first of two science-fiction action-thriller films , is considered by most film reviewers to be a better-crafted film.. Damn close to perfect . More than enough violence to make it a profoundly moral film ; and Arnold 's a whizz . One of the most effective science fiction films of recent decades . A tense , slickly executed thriller , which sent a relatively unknown Austrian bodybuilder screaming into the world 's spotlight . Throughout his extraordinary , legend in his own time career , James Cameron has done very little that can not be legitimately considered well ahead of its time . As for Schwarzenegger , he nicely fleshes out the convention of a soulless gun for hire . With his choppy hair , cryptic shades and state-of-the-'80s leather ensemble , he looks like the Incredible Hulk gone punk . The film that put James Cameron on the map and made Arnold Schwarzenegger an international star , The Terminator is a high-potency distillation of a bunch of sci-fi concepts into one package . 	With its impressive action sequences , taut economic direction , and relentlessly fast pace , it 's clear why The Terminator continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks .
i am legend a solid piece of entertainment if not a classic , at least memorable as it aspires , but does n't quite succeed , in being more than just a horror flick as mindless as the roving mutants it showcases Downright hokey ... a billboard for a Batman-Superman team-up movie ... will elicit more gasps from the fanboys than anything else . The pulp ironies grow so crude and deafening that despite its scattered virtues , I Am Legend leaves you emotionally parched and aesthetically ticked-off . Almost unrelievedly grim and increasingly tedious as it goes along , with a third act that stumbles badly and a coda that 's speciously uplifting . A very disappointing sci-fi snoozer . Despite stunning visuals , it is a B-movie . a captivating and exciting film because of Smith , but even he ca n't save us from this ending . The first two thirds and change of I Am Legend is terrific mindless fun : crackerjack action with gnashing vampires barely glimpsed ( and scarier for that ) and how'd-they-do-that New York locations that retroactively justify the traffic jams . If , as a movie , I Am Legend is less stylistically mind blowing and intellectually ambitious than last year 's Yuletide dystopia , Children of Men , it 's not far off . 	I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith 's mesmerizing performance .
almost famous It 's a well-modulated , immensely likable picture that 's finally too polite for both its subject matter and its critical theme . Anyone who ever had a heart , anyone who ever had a heart broken , will have their heart melted by Almost Famous . A well acted ensemble piece without a single lackluster note . Crowe softens just about everything , as if he did n't want to hurt the feelings of anyone he knew back then . Constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film 's sense of humor . Great , but lots of sex , drugs , and rock 'n ' roll . [ Crowe ] catches every detail perfectly . Crowe does n't paint an idealistic picture of rock in the early '70s , he paints a real one . It will definitely bring back a flood of memories to anyone who actually lived through those times , and certainly connect to anyone else who has ever been a major fan of any rock band or ever wanted to be a musician ( rock star ) themselves . Restores poignancy , originality and innocence to the coming of age film , a genre that had lost them all around the time the CD replaced the LP . 	Almost Famous , with its great ensemble performances and story , is a well-crafted , warm-hearted movie that successfully draws you into its era .
weekend 2011 The longer you spend inside Weekend , the more its fictions seem apparent . An achingly tender chamber piece from first-time director Andrew Haigh . If this lovely movie proffers a thesis or a moral , it 's a simple one . A more open , fully integrated and passionate life feeds the soul no less than air and water . Or coffee the morning after . A stunningly simple , nearly perfect example of a romance movie whose burgeoning couple just happens to be gay . A moving and empathetic look at how relationships develop , at how people fall in love and what that does and does n't do to their lives . Offers up the kind of subtle , truthful relationship drama that 's all too rare in cinema . However , to simply call it 'a gay movie ' would commit it a great disservice as the fragmented kaleidoscope of fleeting romantic pains and pleasures should resonate with gay and straight audiences in equal measure . The bland sentimentality and dull attitudinizing turn the movie into an empty frame of good intentions . If you 've ever met someone who changed your life in the space of days , you 'll relate to something in this movie . The results are gently sincere but maybe a little misguided , a far cry from the note-perfect , transcendently adorable 1999 gay love story `` Trick , '' which this one reminds ofand pales in comparison to . 	It may be a chamber piece but Weekend 's revelations on modern sexuality expand far beyond the modest setting .
stone Angus MacLachlan 's script never convinces , and John Curran 's direction lacks energy . Thick with moral ambiguity , Stone proves to be a character drama that confuses heavy brow-furrowing for an insightful dissection of several ethically slippery individuals . Watching these three actors burrow like ticks into the underbelly of John Curran 's murky moral drama should be enough of a reason to recommend Stone , and it almost is . This is a film about people who are lost , and the filmmakers draw a direct line between their characters ' existential wanderings and the religious obsessions they find for themselves . The seesaw effect of the characters ' clarity and confusion helps Curran & Co. 's unexpected , occasionally heavy-handed fumblings toward examining spiritual emptiness find purchase . Collaborations between Robert De Niro and Edward Norton -- one generation 's most respected actor paired with another 's most affected -- seem doomed to be defined by acting with a capital A . It 's got something to say . What that something is , though -- besides a four character study in spiritual decay -- is sort of up to you . Great performances from the cast in this engrossing drama . What looked like a juicily absurd film noir disguised as a generational acting battle is something closer to a dirge -- a dead-serious meditation on faith and grace , redemption and damnation . It 's hard to say which element of this risible drama is sillier - Angus MacLachlan 's portentous screenplay , cobbled together from half a dozen of Jim Thompson 's lesser potboilers , or Norton 's sustained impression of Bubbles from The Wire . 	Stone boasts a cast that includes Robert De Niro , Edward Norton , and Milla Jovovich , and it features strong dialogue , but it 's ultimately undone by its heavy-handed symbolism and overabundant plot twists .
2 days in the valley The plot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the most widely separated characters , but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue and the behavior . A somewhat entertaining ride to nowhere in particular . Closer to straightforward drama than black comedy . Herzfeld has a tolerable eye for filling a 'Scope frame but a tin ear when it comes to creating dialogue ; these are all characters we 've met before , and most even seem bored with themselves . Mazursky delivers one of the best lines in the film when he observes , `` It 's been my observation that losers are more truthful than winners . '' Amen . Here 's to some losers who sometimes get to win . Herzfeld was obviously shooting for Pulp Fiction meets Short Cuts , but the film is more like Four Rooms meets Prt -- Porter . Not everyone will get this film , but for those who appreciate the delectable rewards of black comedy , this is an encounter with substantial rewards . Charlize Theron is super-sexy , and devilishy memorable This movie is n't bad for mere entertainment , but it 's overshadowed by other , better movies in the same genre . Herzfeld , an award-winning television writer and director , did n't craft either a compelling story or create characters with any real depth . 	A labyrinthine thriller with a host of memorable characters , 2 Days in the Valley is an uneven but intriguing thriller/black comedy .
1010678-invasion of the body snatchers `` You fools ! You 're in danger ! Ca n't you see ? They 're after you ! They 're after all of us ! '' It 's one of the greatest lines in sci-fi movie history , from one of the greatest films , Invasion of the Body Snatchers . This tense , offbeat piece of science-fiction is occasionally difficult to follow due to the strangeness of its scientific premise . Action nevertheless is increasingly exciting . Chilling still . Do not fall asleep while watching it ! The first -- and still best -- version of the Cold War sci-fi , despite compromised ending that was imposed by producer Walter Wanger on the director to make the tale less downbeat and anarchic . An all time classic . The `` message '' was lost on most original viewers . Tenso e bem construdo , conta com uma tima trilha sonora , a direo expressiva de Siegel e com um roteiro que pode ser lido como uma alegoria clara do mccarthismo . A movie that can claim kinship with Alberto Cavalcanti 's Went the Day Well ? as well as The Matrix and Under the Skin . One of the very best sci-fi/horror pictures of one of that genre 's best decades . The film 's portrait of human beings gradually assimilated by an alien invasion of emotionless duplicates creates a profoundly disturbing sense of paranoia . Jack Finney 's magazine story-turned novel `` The Body Snatchers '' has proven remarkably resilient through the years . 	One of the best political allegories of the 1950s , Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an efficient , chilling blend of sci-fi and horror .
dogma Smith has made a movie that reflects the spirit in which many Catholics regard their church . He has positioned his comedy on the balance line between theological rigidity and secular reality , which is where so many Catholics find themselves . The thrill of the movie -- and the reason you do n't have to be religious to be caught up in it -- is the thrill of watching a director wrestle with his obsessions . Nowhere near as bad as the nay-sayers would have you believe . If anything , it 'll open your eyes and make you think , while simultaneously entertaining the hell out of you . It 's too bad Smith 's trademark humor got in the way , because while the film definitely has its flaws , there 's no denying that it also had the ability to serve as an intelligent debate about religion . The real problem with Dogma is not its anti-Papism , but its aggressive and offensive piety . The film takes aim at so many contemporary targets and with such gusto that you fear each time you laugh you might be missing another wonderful line . Writer-Director Kevin Smith keeps getting better . Those who would call it sacreligious ( and there will be many ) should look beyond the foul language and crude humor , to see more deeply into Smith 's intentions to give the dusty doctrines of the ancient faith a fresh new perspective . Ambitious , original , funny . The true target of the film is not religion but religious dogma ... 	Provocative and audacious , Dogma is an uneven but thoughtful religious satire that 's both respectful and irreverent .
fed up 2014 Without being preachy about it , Fed Up flat-out tells us that it is indeed past time to be fed up -- to insist that action be taken , and take it ourselves . This film is a bracing wake-up call . ... an entertaining message movie that ironically mirrors the easy-to-consume junk that is its subject . An eye-opening , heartbreaking , humorous and hopeful harangue about the REAL causes of America 's childhood obesity epidemic . Even if you dispute the facts , one thing is clear : As a nation , we are fat , and getting fatter . A compelling wake-up call in the form of a feature-length documentary . This new documentary aims for something very difficult : It takes a tired subject -- the obesity epidemic -- and completely reframes the conversation . The film 's real strength is actually in Katie Couric 's refined news-anchor delivery , and her skill , charm , and celebrity likely opened some doors . Despite the film 's worthy goals , there are some empty calories . Fed Up is an intriguing but hardly revelatory doc that works better as an expose of an American epidemic than as a tool to spur a healthy-eating movement . A very good advocacy documentary directed by Stephanie Soechtig and narrated by Katie Couric . 	Compelling and troubling in equal measure , Fed Up is an advocacy documentary that earns its outrage .
1141099-hostage An agonizingly heated crime drama . Returns again and again to the scenes built around the threat of a groped or abused child , and pulls still a third teen out of its hat for a gun-to-the-head finale . It 's a full-on adrenaline feature . Reasonably competent and breathlessly paced . What might have been a nice little potboiler ... is done in by director Florent Siri 's bloodthirsty glee at exploiting the movie 's child characters . The makers of Hostage are clearly of the school of thought that believe any scene can be improved with dramatic , swelling music and slow motion action . Accept Hostage for what it is , and a flawed-but-enjoyable ride awaits . I never once glanced at my watch . Takes a kitchen sink approach to the thriller genre , throwing in elements from all types of similar films . This is a masterclass in how to come back after being flushed down the toilet for the umpteenth time Explosions , gunfights and suspense may keep you awake for a while , but not if the movie assaults logic and holds common sense hostage . 	Grisly and cliched , audiences may feel they 're being held Hostage .
joe dirt A grubby Forrest Gump minus the computer-generated presidents and the charm . A lowbrow Forrest Gump without the heart . Check the pedigree of this film first and you may want to proceed no further . This movie is not what you 'd expect . I went in looking for a short , disposable film with lots of redneck and gross-out humor , but came out with a long story , laced with a surprising amount of dramatic moments , little laughs and a sweet side . Gets old fast . Joe is often ridiculous and rather dumb , but there 's a sweetness to him . There 's no mistaking that you 'll get anything other than entertainment of the lowest brow . Spade has sold his golden goose and laid an egg . Were nature to take the course they both seem to want , the movie could end in 15 minutes . And it would still be too long . Too obviously a tormentor himself , Spade ca n't pull off the sentimental formula that Adam Sandler frequently works . 	If you fall within the target audience of Joe Dirt , you may find it funny . Otherwise , the jokes will seem like a tired retread .
gothika ... Berry runs around the prison hysterically in t-shirt and jeans , vainly searching for a way to bust out of this movie . A preposterous movie , and Berry is preposterous in it . This overripe grade-C reconstitution of a grade-B scary thriller hauls out thunderstorms , blood , the ghosts of butchered girls , nightmares , and the usual head trips . In the end , the more lurid the explanations are , the more ludicrous they are , too . It 's silly stuff , but I suppose it 's fine as far as it goes . It is a thoroughly synthetic confection , compounded of clichs drawn from a half-dozen genres and subgenres that for a while might almost persuade its audience , as it apparently convinced its makers , that it is something more . There 's nothing worse than watching an involving motion picture collapse into rubble before your eyes , and that 's exactly what happens here . A desperate frenzy of cheap thrills . A hilarious coda of `` logic is overrated '' covers both the film and its existence . For those who want nothing more than a thorough scare , Gothika is effective . But for those of us who want some psychological insight with our frightfests , the film is sadly lacking . Littered with clichs and lacking even a speck of originality , this gothic snoozer is yet another entry in the if-we-build-it-they-will-come horror sweepstakes . 	Berry 's acting talents ca n't save Gothika from its preposterous plot and bad dialogue .
the keeping room Whatever its intentions , `` The Keeping Room '' does little more than preserve the illusion of a martyred , righteous Confederacy . The Keeping Room is beautiful , suspenseful and thoughtful . A true triumph ! Daniel Barber 's beautifully shot and authentically set story is somewhat disjointed , but good acting and the women 's bond nearly make up for that . Never for a moment does Marling , Steinfeld or Otaru let a hint of modernity affect their speech or performance . A pretty , tense and well-acted film , but it too easily forgives itself for glossing over what could otherwise have been incredibly intricate and multifaceted characters and situations . For about two-thirds of its length ... `` The Keeping Room '' steadily holds the viewer in its narrative clutches . A bold and ballsy fantasy feminist western with tall tale truth telling at its core , the film subversively sets in motion 19th century gender reinvention during war . With women always fighting a different battle , no matter which side of whatever war . I 'm positive there 's an audience for an Old West tale about fierce , independent women . I 'm equally positive it can be done better . The film 's frustrating , fascinating , at times too eager to shock . But it 's also daring and eccentric . A tough and rather merciless film that makes no bones about the horrors of war . It is also a strong and strident story of how three very different women unite as they defend their home and each other . 	Aided by its spare setting and committed performances , The Keeping Room is just fascinatingly off-kilter enough to overcome its frustrating stumbles .
not quite hollywood There is a remarkable story to be told of outlaws carving out their own slice of the industry with scant regard for decorum , personal safety or narrative coherence . All in all , this is a celebration of Australian exuberance , a national ethic of adventurousness and enormous charisma . Not Quite Hollywood contains as many crazy characters and improbable events as its recent fictional counterparts , except that the people are real and the stories all true . I 'm not sure how this will appeal to a general public but for those of us who remember the films , Not Quite Hollywood is a blast . The archived clips flash by so quickly that the audience can not get a grip on a single one . If you do n't already love the underground world of masochistic movies , this will be a real eye-opener . Aussie genre pics of the 1970s and '80s get a rip-roaring salute in Not Quite Hollywood . There are clips from more than 80 movies crammed into 100 consistently hilarious and jaw-dropping minutes , from soft- and hard-core porn to cheesy , gory horror movies to biker and car chase movies that make The Fast and the Furious look positively tame . The end product , while shallow and sometimes disconcertingly furtive , offers an enlightening , pleasurable peek into one of cinema 's more enticing dark corners . ... an audacious , in-your-face documentary ... 	A raucous , fast-paced celebration of the Ozploitation films that came out of Australia in the 1970s and 1980s .
blade runner The macro eye closeup that opens this spectacular film ( newly scrubbed and polished ) is a perfect statement for the movie , human but abstract : unconnected to a face . This is the tenth final version of the Blade Runner . This version is the best . It goes snap . . .snap . . . snap . Visually dazzling but thematically mediocre . Scott 's film may keep us at arm 's length , but it holds us , too . Film noir cubed , science fiction a step beyond 2001 . The film is great on every level : the poignant screenplay about man 's futile quest for immortality ; Scott 's tremendous direction ; the incredible , futuristic sets designed by Lawrence G. Paull , Syd Mead and others ; the phenomenal special effects . Open the champagne : Blade Runner is finally just the way Ridley Scott wanted it . And it only took 25 years . A very dark and far too long thriller with many dull moments that would serve the film better by moving along a bit faster . The most intelligent and terrifying vision of the future ever conceived for the screen ... A visually stunning , film , a truly influential masterpiece that has been copied time and time again . Unfortunately , it is also an emotionally vacant and ultimately unrewarding film experience . 	Misunderstood when it first hit theaters , the influence of Ridley Scott 's mysterious , neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time . A visually remarkable , achingly human sci-fi masterpiece .
10011304-thirst Although the focus of its narrative movement is not always clear , in its best moments , Thirst offers something of the poetic force of cinema 's timeless masterpieces . Though brimming with crisp , stylish coolness and some unsettling images , it does n't have much of an emotional center . Full of ache and desire , Tae-ju seems the ultimate embodiment of the title of Park Chan-wook 's new film , Thirst ( Bakjwi ) . What sets Park 's film apart from the standard vampire picture has more to do with its tone , characterizations , and its strange blend of lyricism and pitch-black comedy . ... director Chan-wook Park ( `` Old Boy '' ) has a field day tossing several genres into a blender to concoct his deliriously wacky , erotic , comedic and gory twist on the vampire tale . Thirst is at least a half-hour too long . The story goes off course with pointless distractions and feeds on non-stop grisliness . Something must have bored writer/director Chan-wook Park , because the second and third acts of Thirst play like scenes out of a totally different and much more incoherent film . Among its type , 'Thirst ' succeeds despite too many distractions . There are more interesting ideas in a reel of Thirst than in dozens of other vampire movies combined . And Park 's visual eye is as strong as ever . Some of the imagery in Thirst is jaw-droppingly creative and memorable . A gaudy , daring , operatic , and bloody funny provocation of a melodrama from Park Chan-wook . 	The stylish Thirst packs plenty of bloody thrills to satisfy fans of both vampire films and director Chan Wook Park .
trollhunter Trollhunter adopts the form of a found footage documentary , which translates as lots of banal conversations , abundant shots of the Scandinavian countryside , and competent but shaky handheld camerawork . You 'll want to catch this clever movie before Hollywood ruins everything with a dumb remake . ... plays like a northern response to Gareth Edwards 's `` Monsters , '' using the found footage device of `` Cloverfield '' with dashes of `` Jurassic Park '' and the satirical humor of neighboring Finland 's `` Rare Exports . '' A true one-off , with all the frustrated expectations that entails . In a filmic landscape littered with the lurching corpses of zombies and the emotional angst of vampires , it 's refreshing to be presented with a mythology that is less familiar . A monster movie-disaster film hybrid that does n't take itself too seriously . The combination works beautifully making the piece wildly enjoyable and surprisingly believable , too . 90 minutes of jolly giant ogre mayhem Andr vredal 's enjoyably goofy scare-pic purports to offer real footage of real horror - in this case , a variety of forest and mountain trolls ... Enormously entertaining chiller . A monster thrill ride that combines handheld camerawork with rollicking action reminiscent of Jurassic Park . 	Trollhunter is a mockumentary with an appropriate level of creeping dread , but one that also benefits from generous helpings of dry wit .
1041911-unforgiven This is the finest set of performances ever to grace a Clint Eastwood movie , and this time Eastwood even does a good job directing Eastwood . Every bullet in this movie matters . High Noon it is n't ; it 's more like the darkest midnight of the American soul . It should n't be missed by anyone with a taste for Eastwood 's typically slanted morality . It 's the actor/director 's best movie -- and the best Western by anybody -- in over 20 years . Hollywood 's great revisionist western , well deserving of its Best Picture Oscar It 's a somber feature , but one of extraordinary character development , bundled into a compelling story of men facing their sins in a most brutal , pitiless manner . While Eastwood dedicates the film to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel , his early directors , he does n't seem to have learned all that much from them . This film shows a surprising bitterness about the myths of the Old West . Yet where they are debunked , the film rings true . One of the greatest Westerns made . In the '90s it stands alone as a great achievement in American filmmaking . This dark , melancholic film is a reminder-never more necessary than now-of what the American cinema is capable of , in the way of expressing a mature , morally complex and challenging view of the world . 	As both director and star , Clint Eastwood strips away decades of Hollywood varnish applied to the Wild West , and emerges with a series of harshly eloquent statements about the nature of violence .
the walk 2015 Channeling the spirit of its subject , The Walk assumes a clownish attitude until , during its finale , it switches gears to become a solemn , striking tribute to human ingenuity , ambition and daring . The film 's payoff more than compensates for a lumbering setup , laden with cloying voiceover narration and strained whimsy . Robert Zemeckis ' re-creation of a New York cityscape that no longer exists is dazzling , as is the vertiginous cinematography of Dariusz Wolski , yet The Walk never really answers the question : `` Why ? '' The last 45 minutes of The Walk is well worth the price of admission . When focused on being a caper film , The Walk is entertaining and exciting . This delivers some frighteningly vertiginous moments once Petit steps off the South Tower into empty space , and Zemeckis wisely milks the climactic wire walk , which lasted 45 minutes and drew a crowd of breathless onlookers below , for all it 's worth . The Walk is a flashy film that repeatedly justifies its existence , and even the inevitable 3D ticket prices . It would be easy for a movie about such a spectacular feat to feel like it 's mostly about the daredevil aspect of that feat , but `` The Walk '' feels like it 's about bigger things such as love , art and what it means to be alive . Less digital dazzle than deja vu , and inches away from death - literally . And essentially seeing is not believing cartoonish caricatures wrapped in distracting hocus pocus layers of optical illusions , as 'the outside world starts to disappear . ' Indeed ... It 's ultimately as entertaining and moving as Man on Wire only on a far grander scale . 	The Walk attempts a tricky balancing act between thrilling visuals and fact-based drama -- and like its wire-walking protagonist , pulls it off with impressive lan .
1010792-its a wonderful life This is the all-time great , curl-up-on-the-sofa-with-a-cup-of-tea movie . Not only is it beautifully photographed , but it also contains enough emotional strength to hold your attention for all of its two-hour running time . A genuine American classic . As God as my witness , I get teary eyed every time Harry Bailey offers that toast to his `` big brother , George . The richest man in town . '' You 'd have to possess a very hard heart not to find something to love in this story . Despite any nay saying that I might work up , I enjoy watching the film . It has an uncanny ability to silence cynics like myself . It 's a Wonderful Life achieves a fine balancing act between pathos and feel-good that is delivered by an outstanding cast . Although sometimes bordering on the maudlin , it remains a beautifully uplifting story and a sweet little comedy as well . This great American fable is buoyed by its unwavering faith in the wealth of the human spirit . Often remembered as sentimental holiday-themed 'Capra-corn ' ... but in fact leavened by darker themes and a more rigorous moral about self-sacrifice . As warm and comforting as a scarf knit by Grandma . 	The holiday classic to define all holiday classics , It 's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing .
inside out 2015 This is a truly great film , a work of beauty and profundity whose computer-generated pixels come closer to human truth that most other live-action movies do . It 's the best thing Pixar has ever produced . It 's the best possible reason for spending cash to spend emotions , as `` Inside Out '' gives you your money 's worth with a story that entertainingly penetrates the mind to unleash the little kid that went MIA when you hit puberty . There 's no real way to prepare yourself for the flat out marvel of Inside Out , the Pixar release that not only revives the studio 's legacy , but the whole concept of family entertainment . Kids will be engaged , but it 's the older viewers - people who have lived and felt a little longer than 11-year-olds - who will most appreciate this marvelous , ingenious work of art . Tthe ordinary trauma of an 11-year-old girl coming to terms with a new life and school while losing all her old , comforting , childish certainties has become a glittering , bravura piece of cinema , a comedy both wise and tender . `` Inside Out '' is a lovingly animated entertainment destined to work in different ways for different age groups , but it is that rare family feature that should inspire just about everyone to think . Who among the great filmmakers has put the workings of the human psyche front and center and made it so intellectually engrossing ? Hitchcock ? Bergman ? Maybe , but I really ca n't remember laughing very much at Vertigo or Persona . Like a cross between Wreck-It Ralph and Mr. Rogers ' Neighborhood , Inside Out dazzles while taking care to send positive messages about the roles of feelings and the value of recognizing and embracing them ... Inside Out is a very fun and smart movie . [ full review in Spanish ] A triumphant return to form for the animation studio . 	Inventive , gorgeously animated , and powerfully moving , Inside Out is another outstanding addition to the Pixar library of modern animated classics .
tortilla soup The romantic foodie movie of the season is upon us , and a delicious dish it is . The film is a charmer , filled with homey details that make you nostalgic for a warm and spicy tortilla soup . A filling but unoriginal dish . A pleasant familial drama spiced with a keen appreciation for the surprising twists and turns of romantic love . Tortilla Soup is bittersweet fun , but it could have been zanier had Maria Ripoll not directed it with such a ponderous , heavy hand . You 'll leave happy and hungry . An OK dish . A mushy , shortcut-laden yawn quite apart from the film from which it stole its material . The recipe is the same ; why does it taste so different ? Mara Ripoll reheats the zesty stew of Ang Lee 's Eat Drink Man Woman ; the result is more sugar than spice . A remake that follows the original point by point but is nevertheless far less satisfying . 	An English remake of Ang Lee 's Eat Drink Man Woman , Tortilla Soup is as charming and flavorful as the dishes it features .
august rush Acclimate yourself to the frenzied vibe and you 'll feel the movie grow into itself as an urban fairy tale whose rapturous finale stakes a wishful claim on the redemptive power of love and art . More fable than film , there is no earthly reason why August Rush should work . But it does . Egregiously self-indulgent and mawkish fairy tale . The goal is to drive mothers everywhere insane with the urge to rescue him and brush his hair ( or the other way around ) , and in my case it worked . Watching this yucky emotional drama is like being sprayed with treacle from a high-pressure hose . Even though August Rush is sappy , it 's the kind of sweetness that everyone needs once in awhile -- like a big , honkin ' ice cream sundae . It can be admired for trying something a little different from the usual family film , but in the end , it just does n't work . At all . A heartwarming fairy-tale that is undeniably sweet , even if it occasionally crosses over into sappiness . The fairy-tale-like family film is one slow , saccharine ride . Those who are willing to open their hearts to this urban fairy tale will find its pleasures , as long as they they do n't think about it too hard . 	Though featuring a talented cast , August Rush can not overcome the flimsy direction and schmaltzy plot .
gracie More charming and enjoyable to watch than it deserves , primarily because the performances transcend the script flaws . The genuine sense of loss and nicely observed family details do n't stand a chance against the generic buildup to the big game . Bruce Springsteen has even given the film his own rare seal of approval by providing a song for the soundtrack -- something he almost never does . See that ? Even the Boss likes Gracie . This labor of love from the Shue siblings is a better than average sports movie . More than that , it 's about a family pulling together to help one member achieve her dream . It 's made bearable by sincere performances all around ... Gracie 's many heartfelt , well-calibrated moments , affecting performances , and evocative visual style should win over those who do give it a shot . The New Jersey locations and soundtrack help ground the story in a particular time and place , and Schroeder delivers a terrific performance . While it may not be quite as memorable as such classic sports films as Hoosiers , Rocky and The Natural , it does have a worthwhile girl-power message and an appealing cast , along with a fairly satisfying emotional climax . There 's nothing startling about Gracie per se , but it manages to do formula without becoming too formulaic , be a feel-good flick without being feel-good gooey . The strong family ties on screen and behind the camera and some gritty authenticity of place and feeling remind us how what could have been cliche can have the power of archetype . 	Gracie can be rousing and touching in spots , but is ultimately undone by its predictable story arc and a lack of nuance .
batman the movie For Bat enthusiasts , this is a gold mine , for everyone else ? A passable cult film . I 'd choose Adam West 's Batmobile over Michael Keaton 's any day . For camp value only Shot in the same campy style that characterized the TV show , all the cast members look like they are having a great time chewing up the scenery . While the film is far from perfect , it 's meant to be that way . Not as good as Batman TV show , but still has endearing moments . Unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life ... the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles Even if it is a compromised version of the TV show , it 's far , far better than nothing . If you loved the series , the movie is what you would expect . I ca n't recommend the film although it does have its moments . 	Batman : The Movie elevates camp to an art form -- and has a blast doing it , every gloriously tongue-in-cheek inch of the way .
army-of-shadows-1969 Rich in the elegance , assurance and quasi-formality that often define Melville 's style . In [ Melville 's ] stark and unvarnished film , the violence is routine and ugly , the moral choices painful and uncertain , the relationships deep yet fragile , the victories costly and ephemeral . It is arguably the tensest , hardest-edged movie of Melville 's career ... and that 's saying something . `` Jean-Pierre Melville cherishes paradox and free thinking , '' and both elements are on beautiful display in his masterpiece . ... the most meaningful atmosphere of exquisite suspense you 're likely to see at the movies this year . Or most years . Emerges from the mists of time in a new 35mm restoration as a career-capping epic tragedy . Although it has several suspenseful sequences , `` Shadows '' is not a spy thriller , precisely . It 's much more along the lines of a melancholy mood piece ... Melville milks the tension for all its worth . Superb . Deals with the French resistance during World War II , but it 's nothing like any other French resistance film ever made . 	Originally made in 1969 , this recently reissued classic is a masterful examination of the inner workings of the World War II resistance efforts .
pianist In ways , it 's more effective than even Spielberg 's Schindler 's List ... Polanski 's work is more of a personal and therapeutic experience for him , going back to his Polish roots in the midst of the horror that he and his family witnessed firsthand . The movie lacks those specific personal moments that pull an audience into a story and let them identify with a character . It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . Although not on a level with `` Schindler 's List , '' Roman Polanski and his creative cohorts impeccably , poignantly recreate the atrocities of that sad , horrifying era of 20th-century history . It will break your heart many times over . It shattered me like no other film since Dead Man Walking . The loneliness , guilt and impotence on Brody 's face is haunting . His performance is extraordinary . Polanski shows us some surreally devastatrng visions and the film 's ultimate `` message '' is one of unalloyed hope and faith in the power of humans to - finally , at last - behave humanely . An incredibly moving and devastatingly brilliant film that will ultimately be hailed as the director 's near masterpiece . It rings with the truth of real-life experience , based of course on Szpilman 's account and mixed with Polanski 's own life . 	Well-acted and dramatically moving , The Pianist is Polanski 's best work in years .
ultimate gift Christian charity , in this movie , seems like a side-effect of capitalism . Pretty much what one would expect : a sincere story of redemption delivered with all the low-key execution of one of those Hallmark-backed TV movies of the week . If anything , the film 's uplifting moral tone seems more in line with a Frank Capra flick than a cinematic sermon . Veterans Garner and Brian Dennehy give convincing professional performances here , but Fuller is bland . It does telegraph its sentiments with all the subtlety of a greeting card . This new film moves along smoothly until Grandpa 's most preposterous mission - which needlessly drags out the movie -- takes Jason to a severely caricatured Ecuador . Wholesome and inspirational , it preaches a simplistic `` prosperity gospel . '' A parabolic film about one selfish young man 's spiritual transformation . It is message filmmaking so blunt you might be tempted to root for the parasitic reprobate over the saintly old man , and that 's just not right . The result is a deep desire for those Hollywood execs to remember that Christian does n't have to equal brain-dead . 	Though The Ultimate Gift avoids religious speechifying like other Fox Faith films , it 's dramatically inert with flat direction .
the strangers As an exercise in controlled mayhem , horror movies do n't get much scarier . At a certain point , The Strangers devolves into the kind of generic chase picture that slasher flicks frequently become . As a simple exercise in tension and dread , this is a gripping hour at the multiplex - it 's just a pity that it goes on for a further 20 minutes . Just get comfortable , sit back and smile at the slaughter - unlike Funny Games , at least this is bloodshed you can enjoy . An effective , scary emotional work-out , but perhaps you can have too much paranoid despair . An immensely creepy thriller , one that plays fair with the audience , treats its characters with unusual intelligence for the genre , and is all the more effective because the minimalist plot is kept spare and straightforward . There 's less suspense around what these lunatics with sharp implements are doing in this home , than what Tyler and Speedman are doing in this movie . As for whoever is left standing at the end , they may have taken the final pages of the script with them . Yes , OK , bad things happen to good people . Consider the message received ... about seven movies ago . The Strangers suffers from lack of originality . I 've seen most of this film in other movies , and as a horror fan , I found little that was new or innovative . Proves well executed simplicity sometimes can be more effective than bombast , blood and things that go boom . 	The Strangers provides a few scares , but offers little else to distinguish itself from other slasher films .
little man It 's a concept , not a movie . There 's nothing like a well-placed nod to the classics to help elevate a dumb summer comedy . when I went to see Little Man , I laughed , then hung my head in shame . Are they going to take away my movie critic license ? Will all of the other critics find out and ridicule me ? Will they let me play in their movie critic games ? The best film I 've ever seen with a full grown man masquerading as a baby ... hmmm . [ The film features ] nonstop slapstick , potty jokes , and sexual gags . If your taste runs to scatology and you find little people inherently funny , Little Man may be the movie for you . Well , it was bound to happen : The Wayans brothers have made a movie that 's even more two-dimensional than a cartoon . It plays like nothing so much as an extended In Living Color stretched to fill 90 minutes , and it feels as thin as it sounds like it should . By the umpteenth variation of mistaking Calvin for a baby the joke has long , long stopped being funny . I remember when the Wayanses were a group of people with ambitions who looked as if they actually had something to contribute to the film world as well as the comedy world . A slap-happy misadventure featuring Marlon Wayans as a foul-mouthed midget masquerading as a baby in order to retrieve a pilfered diamond from a childless couple . 	Another gimmicky comedy from the Wayans brothers , Little Man comes with the requisite raunchiness , but forgot to bring the laughs .
blood simple The Coens explode onto the scene with this blistering neo-noir masterpiece . The script is so tight you can feel it screwing into the back of your neck . Com um estilo marcante j no filme de estria , os irmos Coen criam uma obra noir tensa , envolvente e que faz do absurdo uma de suas principais armas . ... for all its delirious impudence and film school showiness , it 's so clearly a movie made by guys crazy about moviemaking . Taut , quirky , and jump-out-of-your-seat scary ... Blood Simple is so derivative -- of Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain and a thousand and one noirs -- that who or what is being ripped off is essentially beside the point . An inordinately good low-budget film noir thriller . like watching a classic Hitchcock film with the Master of Suspense tripping on acid The pace can at times be a touch slow , but it 's easy to see why the Coens allow certain scenes to simmer , especially when their actors are chewing up the screen as they do . A stylish piece of film noir , it has exasperatingly slow pacing but devilishly demented characters and a wonderfully wicked , labyrinthine plot . 	Brutally violent and shockingly funny in equal measure , Blood Simple offers early evidence of the Coen Brothers ' twisted sensibilities and filmmaking ingenuity .
evan almighty Ultimately , Evan Almighty is too sappy , too sanctimonious . As a crowd-pleasing , undemanding matinee diversion , Evan Almighty is a far more satisfying production than Bruce , and that , to me , is a great thing . Evan Almighty combines the easiest elements of lazy comedy with the most indulgent elements of lazy disaster movies . Even Mr. Carell , gamely mugging and wincing and snaring the random reflex laugh , gets pulled down with the ship . It 's a trifle of a thing ; the kind of thing you 'd see on a broadcast network on a Saturday afternoon , at least before you grew bored and changed the channel . Even the finest of actors would require a miracle when working with gags centred , predominantly , on bird droppings . Evan Almighty belongs to that sorry cinema subgenre , Comedy without the Funny Bits . Mildly amusing . Somehow this boat floats along , a lasting tribute to lightweight construction . Entertaining enough to be a big hit , but the script is badly underwritten . Steve Carell , a funny man in most circumstances , as been left high and dry ... 	Big on special effects but short on laughs , Evan Almighty underutilizes a star-studded cast that includes Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman .
the snowtown murders The Snowtown Murders builds into a multipronged horror effort in which the torture and murder on-screen are matched by the psychologically convincing disintegration of a previously sympathetic protagonist . Overlong and grim to the point where some scenes are virtually unwatchable ... Powerfully directed and superbly written , this is a genuinely disturbing , emotionally draining serial killer drama with a stunning central performance from Daniel Henshall . Though many will be put off by the elliptical style of this clammy , feral drama about Australia 's most infamous serial killer , Daniel Henshall 's jaw-droppingly malevolent performance will reward all those who seek it out . It 's one of the most disturbing movies of our moment , not just for the true-crime subject , but because Kurzel 's searing technique and expertise with actors get so far under your skin . Snowtown is not a film about the why of evil , but the how of it . It 's an extremely well-made , shattering film . Observing the character 's regular and repeated acts of cruelty becomes numbing after awhile . Uncompromising and distressing , Snowtown delves into the grizzly events of Australia 's worst serial murders , while exploring the slippery slope of vigilante justice within a community left to the wolves . However disquieting the film ( based on the story of Australia 's worst serial killer , John Bunting ) , it 's also - inconveniently - awfully boring . Whatever one ends up thinking about The Snowtown Murders , it 's difficult to deny that it 's a deeply impressive work . 	It 's a bleak and brutal endurance test , but for viewers with the strength and patience to make it to the end , Snowtown will prove an uncommonly powerful viewing experience .
you got served Where 's Shabba-Doo when you need him ? A textbook case of how not to make a film about dancing . It does n't even live up to the low standards of the mid-'80s Breakin ' dance movies . A thinly written , hoarily cliched story that serves mostly as connective tissue between the movie 's chief draw , its dazzling dance sequences . The whole thing is tailor-made for people who are too young to notice or care that they 're being shamelessly exploited for a quick buck . If you want to bring back the '80s by emulating those awful Golan/Globus dance movies , you have to GET Golan and Globus ! Everything else is just 4th rate . A street-dance film that 's lively and silly and about as 'street ' as a Britney Spears video . When the movie is n't dancing , it 's dead . It 's too bad more energy was n't devoted to fleshing out the one-dimensional characters and crafting a decent script . A spirited , guilty pleasure of a dance movie . 	The dance sequences are exhilarating , but everything else about this movie is sloppy and generic .
shaggy dog A mongrel marriage of frantic physical farce and sub-standard CGI work that turns out vaguely creepy rather than cute . Just when you thought Doogal set the lowest bar possible for a dog comedy , here comes The Shaggy Dog , a pointless remake of the 1959 Disney classic . A flea-bitten farrago which bears only a fleeting resemblance to the 1959 film that inspired it . Five writers ( Cormac Wibberley , Marianne Wibberley , Geoff Rodkey , Jack Amiel and Michael Begler ) threw everything they could think of against the wall , hoping some of it would stick , but nothing did . Just when you prayed that Hollywood would stop recycling ideas that were n't so hot in the first place , along comes The Shaggy Dog . Shaggy Dog is a subpar remake of a subpar movie that can only spawn subpar remakes . The latest mutation of a franchise that Disney probably should have had spayed or neutered years ago . The Shaggy Dog may be silly , contrived and obvious , but it is wholesome , spirited family entertainment . The lab experiments include CGI genetic cross-breeds like a dog-frog combo that exemplify this movie 's own uneasy mixture of slapstick and sentiment . Allen 's latest flea-bitten family fare fluff is indeed a dog -- both literally and figuratively ... [ an ] infantile tail-wagging fantasy . 	This Disney retread has neither inspiration nor originality , but may please moviegoers under the age of ten .
gin gwai 2002 Given that the current state of American Horror is usually so watered-down and generic , even a 'pretty good ' horror import is reason to rejoice . Although I have mixed feelings about The Eye , there 's no question the Pangs have a natural talent for cinema . It 's like `` The Hand '' clumsily mishmashed with `` At First Sight '' , `` The Sixth Sense '' , `` Ring '' and `` The Mothman Prophecies '' , and it just goes on and on . The overall visual imagery is terrifically effective , unsettling and eerie , yet darkly beautiful at the same time . It 's unabashedly derivative and spooky enough to keep you up at night . Fans of the genre may still find the film as creepy and scary as it is intended to be , although it relies for so much of its scare-power on sudden bursts of flame accompanied by fearsome noise , or the appearance of ghostly death figures ... very effectively done , very scary ! The Coens have often been accused of coldness toward their characters , but the verve and wit of their films reveal genuine compassion and heart . Based on the evidence of this film , the Pangs are n't quite there yet . [ The Pangs ' ] sense of pacing is nicely arrhythmic , which makes the 'boo ' moments all the more heart-thudding , but what 's even more pleasurable are the pockets of quiet , those lacuna of low-frequency dread when nothing much happens . Oh yeah , I was scared -- scared that I 'd wake up before the credits rolled . 	Conventional ghost tale with a few genuine scares .
1200841-hunger A harrowing yet lyrical account of the fatal hunger strike of Irish Republican Army prisoner Bobby Sands in the Maze Prison , Northern Ireland , in 1981 . Hunger stands as one of the year 's finest movies , full of imagery and ideas that will stay with you long after this piece of powerhouse art has ended . Shockingly immediate and philosophically reflective , Hunger is an indelibly moving tribute to what makes us human . McQueen 's film is a nuanced masterpiece that never flaunts its artistry , but uses it humbly to serve the all-important story . There is an avoidance of affect and a repudiation of the traditional liberal-lenient gestures of dialogue , dramatic consensus and narrative resolution . This is a powerful , provocative piece of work , which leaves a zero-degree burn on the retina . Trite , grim and feebly provocative . A riveting , harrowing true story that forces us to examine exactly what 's involved in putting your life on the line for a cause Hunger will leave you feeling emotionally battered and bruised -- yet emerging from the cinema a stronger person for having witnessed such a beautiful and brutal film . Powerful , pertinent but not entirely perfect . Riveting but uncomfortable . No masterpiece . 	Unflinching , uncompromising , vivid and vital , Steve McQueen 's challenging debut is not for the faint hearted , but it 's still a richly rewarding retelling of troubled times .
mighty wind Lacks the belly laughs of 'Best in Show ' but goes deeper and is sweeter . With Guest again demonstrating affection for the subjects he teases -- the humor is never mean-spirited , and some of the music is kind of fun -- his fans are likely to be toe-tappingly pleased . It is as accurate as it is funny . Not quite what it could have been , but it features enough priceless moments and catchy music to be well worth seeing . Ao substituir a acidez de seus filmes anteriores por um tom mais simptico aos personagens , Guest perde parte da graa - mas , ainda assim , consegue divertir bastante . This stuff is sporadically amusing but never laugh-out-loud funny because we never escape the feeling that the gang is coasting until a more worthy target materializes , a target they can lambaste with impunity . The most mature , heartfelt and keenly observed film of Team Guffman . An unforced , affectionately mocking picture which might not generate a constant gale of laughter , but does invite a steady stream of smiles and chuckles . Horrible . I 'm grateful for anything that makes me laugh this hard . 	Though not as uproariously funny as Guest 's previous movies , A Mighty Wind is also more heartfelt .
steve jobs 2015 Steve Jobs is an arresting , razor-sharp piece of human drama that probes the slippery divide between persona and person . The film feels so electric while you 're watching , it 's hard to believe that after two hours , it does n't even get to the iPod , let alone the iPhone . I came away with the feeling that the filmmakers were practically implying that his early death at 56 was some kind of karmic payback . In many ways the film reflects its hero 's brilliance . It 's a scintillating construction , though one that sometimes feels like a product launch in its own right . As scathingly played by Fassbender , Jobs looks almost as sleek and perfected as one of his computers . From a performance standpoint , the film stands near the top of ensembles and individualized works seen in 2015 . Fassbender approaches Jobs with a familiarity . He finds sarcasm to be a second language , and repugnancy to be a way of life . It is a formally audacious , intellectually energized entertainment , a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting . Written , directed and acted to perfection , and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed . Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Jobs . Is he really that good ? Hell , yeah . Can you be a nice guy , and a great man ? Steve Jobs is the case in point , and `` Steve Jobs '' says no . `` Birdman '' for the tech sector . 	Like the tech giant co-founded by its subject , Steve Jobs gathers brilliant people to deliver a product whose elegance belies the intricate complexities at its core .
antz In some ways this is Starship Troopers , as seen from the other side . Visually striking and dynamically shot , this has strong characters and no shortage of incident . The computer animation is first rate and filled with the kind of `` Wow ! Look at that ! '' wizardry that is eventually going to make Toy Story look about as technically sophisticated as South Park . exciting , often hilarious and frequently wondrous film ... Adults who live in fear of seeing non-Disney animated movies would be well-advised to overcome their prejudices . More story , less silly antics . Maybe then I 'll be inclined to put down my can of Raid . The philosophical debates that centre the film are rather complex for little ones , but give us older ones something to talk about . Antz is crawling -- you 'll excuse the pun -- with classic movie comedy . Antz is about the relief felt by star actors freed from the constraints of their physical selves and the egos that go with them . A Woody Allen movie , with all the adult laughs , esteem issues and other accouterments that come with it , and a great kiddie flick , complete with the requisite warm and fuzzy character-building lessons . It is hipper and funnier than anything Disney has put out for years . 	Featuring a stellar voice cast , technically dazzling animation , and loads of good humor , Antz should delight both children and adults .
last exorcism A clever , small film that depicts showman-preachers and horror movies with a wink and nod , The Last Exorcism spends most of its 88 minutes staying a cut above the average horror flick . An unusually restrained and genuinely eerie little movie perched at the intersection of faith , folklore and female puberty . Horror movies these days are so often frivolous -- formulaic larks calculated to provide mechanical thrills . Here 's one that delivers an experience . A creepy , smartly written and very entertaining low-budget chiller . A man very much of these times , Cotton is that rarity in the horror genre : a genuinely intriguing character . Anyone with a decent knowledge of horror flicks will surely recoil in terror at how terribly several masterpieces of the genre have been shamelessly ripped off . As taut and economical a horror film as I 've seen in a long time ... a gripping little movie that will give you the willies . The Last Exorcism is one of the scariest movies to come along in a long time -- until the last five minutes or so , when it completely falls apart . Stamm effectively crafts a dozen or so marvellously creepy moments . Audience faith in the existence of decent horror films is reaffirmed . Any film that forges as unruly a connection as this one does with its audience deserves some applause , especially when the film belongs to a genre where all too many of its peers come across as rote or as thoughtlessly , remorselessly heartless . 	It does n't fully deliver on the chilly promise of its Blair Witch-style premise , but The Last Exorcism offers a surprising number of clever thrills .
inglourious basterds QT manipulates WWII horror into hip pornography -- Jewish revenge looks just like the sadism in Eli Roth 's Hostel movie . Our political and moral responses are discombobulated . The film might not be Tarantino 's masterpiece but it is his most entertaining and exhilarating effort since Pulp Fiction . Scenes like the showdown in the tavern and the movie-premiere finale are as imaginative , energetic and , in their own weird , brutal way , beautiful as cinema gets . This rollicking epic harks back to typical wordy Tarantino fare , with the added explicit violence that 's to be expected from this cult director . A brawny , rollicking mash-up that is a passionate exploration of the power of filmmaking from one of our finest directors and writers . Despite the injection of content from a variety of directions , Basterds lacks the crackly excitement of Tarantino 's other efforts , mainly because he ca n't seem to tie the whole package together . A work that is experimental , offbeat , and most distinctly of a unique voice is a welcome rarity . A failure so complete that it is infuriating as opposed to merely disappointing By far the best World War II film I 've ever seen . The true moral universe in which the film unfolds is that of the spaghetti westerns ... : a world in which the strong are above the law and the way to tell the good guys from the bad guys is not by their acts but by the kind of hats they wear . 	A classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride , Inglourious Basterds is violent , unrestrained , and thoroughly entertaining ,
under the sand Rampling , working in French , remarkably delivers what is perhaps her deepest , most effortlessly nuanced performance . Unlike many of Hitchcock 's films , which ascribe female mental disorders to simple causes , Under the Sand leaves much of the lead character 's psychology open to discussion -- and is stronger for it . Where Rampling really bares herself is in the emotional revelations and rawness she delivers in just about every screen . Full of writer/director Franois Ozon 's lightly perverse touches and skewed vision of humanity , and all the more emotionally engaging because of it . Each of the elements in Under the Sand is beautifully integrated and each in support of what is essentially an extended aria of loss and devotion . Charlotte Rampling is delightfully sincere and believable in her subtle performance . A delicate and devastating film . Charlotte Rampling , given the chance to portray an older , yet still sexual , woman runs with it Under The Sand is vaguely disturbing , in an emotional sense , at all times . ... this picture demands ( and rewards ) close study ... 	Rampling carries the film with her finely nuanced performance of a woman coping with her husband 's death .
attack the block This is a snarky , humorous movie about blasting aliens to bits , but if you 're looking for more , you wo n't be left hanging . The monsters of the popular imagination are called upon to save us from imaginary monsters . This is , in terms of its central plot , a pretty straightforward monster movie , but it has a very distinctive character . Poses a tongue in cheek question - `` What 's scarier , hostile extra-terrestrials or black youth ? '' - and then riffs on the sad reality that many people would say the latter . Few movies this year have been as all-out fun to watch as this one . Employs its sci-fi tale to wrestle with issues of race and class structure -- the sort of deep thought lost on Hollywood kingpins like Michael Bay , whose idea of sensitive racial exploration was to create Amos 'n ' Andy robots for that Transformers flick . If Attack the Block does n't cut quite as deeply as Cornish , in the movie 's first third , hints that it might , at least it 's powered more by modest smarts than by excessive , wasteful amounts of dough . a bit like Goonies and War of the Worlds filtered through the original English version of Skins It enhances a sense of the world rather than peddling distraction from it . The inky , somewhat shapeless beings are n't any scarier than your typical Muppet . Which is kind of a problem when you 're offering an R-rated thriller . 	Effortlessly mixing scares , laughs , and social commentary , Attack the Block is a thrilling , brisky-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor .
10008601-fireflies in the garden This histrionic family drama must have looked good on paper to attract such a big-name cast , but on the screen it comes off as glib , rushed , and underdeveloped . The relationships are lived-in and complex , with the same hopelessness that we find in real life . People do n't change . A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what 's the phrase ? - `` nuanced performances '' . Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers , but why do we have to suffer for their art ? Just when you 're hitting your tolerance breaking point for these people and their nonstop bellyaching and yelling and baffling hatred for one another , the equally baffling reconciliation kicks in . What just happened ? As tales of troubled families go , it may have aspirations to be like Ordinary People , but it falls way short . A thoughtful tale but it is not original enough to provide a long-lasting glow . They stagger down memory lane for a little bloodletting , inspect skeletons in the cupboard and invariably end up bathing together in a hot tub of sentimental forgiveness and understanding . Julia Roberts plays ultra-sensitive artiste Ryan Reynolds ' noble mother-and that should basically tell you all you need to know about this misguided soapy bunch of bollocks which somehow made its way off the shelf into theatres . The elements are all there but never fully click into place - more like a TV movie than a big-screen drama . Has all the personality and forward momentum of a cardboard box . 	Despite boasting a stellar cast , Fireflies in the Garden is just tedious , dull and predictable melodrama . Instantly forgettable .
mio fratello e figlio unico Although the movie never quite dispels the sense of being dated ( it could have been made anytime in the past 40 years ) , it 's a memorable , often moving timepiece . The fey illogic in the title of My Brother is an Only Child hints at the style of this funny-sad film , which flips from dark to light moods and back with suave , unpredictable dexterity . Thanks to the captivating performances , this is well worth checking out . Tells a familiar story in a familiar way with conviction and no small amount of talent on both sides of the camera , though it 's hardly essential . The film , which argues that blood brotherhood is stronger than political brotherhoods , vibrates with their youthful energy and ardor . Sometimes , under a torrent of social pressures , water runs faster , if not thicker , than blood , and even the strongest bonds drown in the flood . A spunky , memorable , and emotionally touching Italian film about the quest for personal transformation through politics . My Brother Is An Only Child reminisces with improbable yet affecting fondness over the adolescents behind the -isms that would shape post-war Italy . Luchetti directs with a light touch that recalls the Italian comedies that were popular -- in the U.S. as well as Europe -- during the period it portrays . manages to evoke , but never trivialise , the mad , internecine conflicts of recent Italian political history 	Luchetti takes advantage of the storyline 's historical context without sacrificing his cast 's fine performances or the script 's light wit .
1000642-all quiet on the western front This uncompromising drama makes a bleak statement of war fighting in trenches , stressing the inanity of WWI ( or any war ) for both sides ; perhaps the most memorable moment is the one in which Lew Ayres reaches out for a butterfly to disastrous effect . All Quiet on the Western Front ( 1930 ) is the first major anti-war film of the sound era , faithfully based upon the timeless 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque . Despite a little dating around the edges this is a truly superb example of its genre and a cinema classic . Deserves its reputation as a classic . Messrs . Milestone , Abbott and Anderson in this film have contributed a memorable piece of work to the screen . The performances are also exemplary , but it is primarily a film of great moments -- the climactic sequence of the young conscript reaching out for a butterfly in the sun -- that , once seen , are never forgotten . A Classic and then some Classic early talkie is still anti-war effective . So magnificent , so powerful , that it hardly behooves mere words to tell of its heart-rending appeal , of its dramatic fire , its breath-taking battle shots in which men stab and kill each other , for the glory of war . Perhaps the greatest antiwar film ever made . 	Director Lewis Milestone 's brilliant anti-war polemic , headlined by an unforgettable performance from Lew Ayres , lays bare the tragic foolishness at the heart of war .
10006485-black gold There are shocking facts and supportive images , but the film lacks investigative spirit . There is obviously a serious imbalance here and even if the filmmakers do n't get the complete picture , they at least make a case for the farmers themselves . A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade . Whether due to resources or time or just plain laziness , directors Marc and Nick Francis have fashioned a rather shapeless movie that raises many good points but fails to fully investigate its findings . The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story . `` Black Gold '' also finds cause for optimism in its connections , showing how if Western coffee drinkers make the right choices at their end , they can positively affect the African growers at the other . ... gorgeously-shot , melancholy . If that $ 2 cup of Starbucks did n't jolt you awake , this documentary by Marc and Nick Francis might do the trick . A film to think about every time you order a Triple Grande Soy Latte . Meskela 's is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach . 	Black Gold is an eye-opening account of the winners and losers in the global coffee trade .
the dilemma Finding humor in this humorless situation is The Dilemma . Perhaps the late Blake Edwards could have found a balance between slapstick and psychodrama , but Ron Howard ca n't get the pacing right , and Allan Loeb 's script is even wordier than the one he wrote for Wall Street : Money Never Sleeps . Dilemma rests on the same structural foundation as episodes of Three 's Company , when Mr. Roper thought he heard shenanigans through the kitchen door . A simple conversation would clear things up . How are the mighty fallen ... unavoidably second-rate ... a likable guy goes completely bonkers , and it is n't funny ... Tatum charmingly steals his scenes with Vaughn , revealing how limited the actor is ... Definitely aimed at males , the movie is quite misogynistic . Unfortunately , Ronny and Nick 's bromance takes over , and James has neither the comedy chops or wildness to keep up with Vaughn . It 's safe and boring Let 's have a toast for Vince Vaughn , shall we ? It 's just a failure , full stop . The filmmakers just do n't know what to do about the ladies . The jokes , when and where they can be found , are puerile , and continually give Vaughn the movie-star catbird seat . 	It boasts a likable cast and an interesting premise , but The Dilemma ca n't decide what to do with them ; the result is an uneven blend of cheesy slapstick and surprisingly dark comedy .
all about the benjamins From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . As violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen . Tedious and hackneyed , you would have thought that New Line Cinema could have invested a few more benjamins into getting a workable script before filming commenced . Riddled with so many bullets and tasteless jokes that it swiftly loses momentum . the heroes become more loathsome as the story progresses . Goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . Spend your Benjamins on a matinee . The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . This one is a waste of your Washingtons . One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 	A sloppy , poorly directed action-comedy , All About the Benjamins is too derivative and gratuitously violent .
paperclips It 's hard to find fault with the motives of the teachers and the kids . Their determination and results are admirable . You have to be a pretty cynical not to be a little moved . The project is chronicled eloquently in Paper Clips , a documentary about how a few kids can make a difference , one paper clip at a time . Patiently told and lovingly made . A moving experience . It 's a remarkable story , and well worth seeing , particularly for its handful of genuinely affecting moments . There is something quite heartening about watching these kids earnestly guide others around their memorial , which was four years in the making . Low-key but inspirational . Affectingly documents an example of caring , concerned students and the inspiring educators who lead them . Where other documentarians look for a charismatic personality to enliven their films , Berlin and Fab focus on the community as a whole . 	A touching , though somewhat flat , documentary that follows a homogenous class of white Protestant eighth graders as they learn the importance of tolerance by erecting a monument to the 6 million victims of the Holocaust .
incredibles Phenomenal , magnificent , exuberantly entertaining , and just about any other positive adjective you can think of . [ A ] brilliantly animated , cleverly written family adventure . Another hip-but- wholesome animated family comedy from Hollywood superhero Pixar . Pixar 's new animated action-comedy , about a superhero family stuck in middle-class suburban exile , comes tantalizingly close to greatness . This is an amazing movie . The animation is as lush and colorful as usual , and a lock for an Oscar nomination for best animated film is as much of a lock as a scorching Arizona summer . By far the best of the CGI-animated films in the Disney canon , a wondrous and exciting spectacle that is just as enticing narratively as it is visually . The command and ingenuity with which Pixar has , once again , raised the level of excellence to which animated movies ( and , why stop there , all movies ) can aspire is easy to take for granted . Brace yourself for something more sophisticated and ... adult . The Incredibles is not cut from the same touchy-feely ... mold as Toy Story , Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo . An epic battle between conformity and exceptionality in The Incredibles , which will be catnip for superhero buffs and a great time at the movies for everyone else . 	Bringing loads of wit and tons of fun to the animated superhero genre , The Incredibles easily lives up to its name .
beats rhymes and life the travels of a tribe called quest Tribe 's music takes a backseat to power struggle and personality conflict . A hip-hop version of The Rolling Stones ' ' Gim me Shelter ' and one of the best music docs to come out in recent years . Whether you love hip hop or not , this is a documentary not to be missed and one that will not be forgotten . A combination of timing , access , a visual aesthetic that reflects ATCQ 's Afrocentric `` surface philosophy '' ( as the crew 's look is described ) and , most importantly , story-conscious editing elevates the doc above the norm . The band 's politically charged hits still sound as fresh as when they were recorded , and their side projects may have improved with age . I had to download Jungle Brothers ' `` Black Is Black '' the minute I left the theater . It tells a real story that is both complex and coherent , putting ATCQ 's impact on the level of what Dylan and The Beatles provided in their respective moments in musical history . And the argument is well made . This documentary therefore did exactly what a good music doco should do : brought people like me up to speed and , according to reports from more serious hip hop fans in the audience , provided lots of information that was n't previously well known . Maybe I 'm just a sucker for good old fashioned hip-hop , but I found Michael Rapaport 's totally-by-the-numbers music doco [ Beats , Rhymes & Life : The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest ] absolutely compelling . A reminder , part `` Behind the Music '' and part something better , that even artists professing love and togetherness have a hard time keeping it going . [ I ] t might have been nice if the documentary had worked a bit harder to find a real internal narrative . Rapaport , a longtime Quest fan , clearly admires Tip . He 's just too forthright a storyteller to bury the tale of the quartet 's acrimonious unraveling . 	This documentary focuses less on the music and more on the personality clashes and in-group tensions to great , compelling effect .
the arbor 2010 The peanut gallery might say Clio Barnard 's genre-bending The Arbor is a mixed-up moving target , but it 's strikingly honed in on its subject : the lauded writer and loathed matriarch Andrea Dunbar . The Arbor is not an easy film , but it 's a rewarding one . Brings the Dunbar story to life through a technique known as `` verbatim theater , '' in which actors lip-synch testimony from the real people they 're portraying . Original mixture of techniques makes this documentary provocative yet moving . A compelling insight into a challenging woman , given an extra dimension by some brave if occasionally dubious directorial flourishes . A mother-daughter tragedy presented in a cinematic hall of mirrors , The Arbor aestheticizes its grim nonfiction narrative with mixed results . A bold experiment that does n't quite work . British Poor Adrift in Turbulent 'Arbor ' From the sublimely ridiculous to the simply sublime , The Arbor exists at the intersection of life and art , reality and performance , documentary and fiction , and it explores that terrain in a way no other movie quite has before . The emotional core of the film holds fast , which is the only thing that matters , however fictional or factual the film appears to be . 	Smart and inventive , The Arbor offers some intensely memorable twists on tired documentary tropes .
the rover Michod provides little insight into his lethally purposeful avenger , save a rueful musing on the value of guilt and the need to dwell on your sins ... when he 's not blazing away with fatal abandon . Blood is spilled , as is to be expected in a film that explores a world on the brink of ruin , but each death echoes through the story the way the hero 's gunshots echo across the Outback . It 's bound to remind viewers of The Mad Max/Road Warrior movies with its silences and baking-hot open spaces . When characters do speak , the language sounds lyrical and sometimes profound . The idea that there are moral laws at work in the universe exceeding our man-made attempts at justice is a great one , worthy of a great film . One day , hopefully , Michod will make it . The Rover is a hugely stressful tone poem in which on-screen characters are constantly being shot and killed by off-screen characters ... [ It ] at least makes for a better Cormac McCarthy movie than The Counselor did . The violent , nihilistic and tedious revenge drama emerges as this year 's standard for meaningless . A film shot in 100-degree-plus heat that chills the blood as well as the soul . If Cormac McCarthy had written Mad Max or Sergio Leone had shot a spaghetti western in Australia it might look something like The Rover . Take an immensely talented director , a first-class cinematographer , a collection of decidedly gifted actors and film them . Tack on a musical soundtrack that bristles with originality and what do you have ? In the case of The Rover , not much . Guy Pearce excels in a difficult role and Robert Pattinson is believable and entertaining as his partner on this oft-beaten track through a dystopia of our making . 	Fueled by engaging performances from Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson , the tension-filled The Rover overcomes its narrative faults through sheer watchability .
code unknown Code Unknown is a film that will thrill connoisseurs of alienation and loneliness , and I say that with the utmost sincerity . As an intellectual exercise , it 's quite distinguished . As a drama , its reach exceeds its grasp . Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story , expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections . Una maravilla de mltiples lecturas , y no todas triviales ... A procession of long virtuoso takes that typically begin and end in the middle of actions or sentences , constituting not only an interactive jigsaw puzzle but a thrilling narrative experiment . This film , from Austrian director Michael Haneke , is one of the most uncompromisingly difficult and challenging of the year . Too self-consciously obtuse , enigmatic and 'meaningful ' for its own good , it demands far more than it gives back in return . All this unrelenting bleakness would be fine if it went someplace interesting , but the film 's themes never coalesce into anything beyond basic existential angst . If some of the political theorising is somewhat naive and the direction is occasionally manipulative , the acting , particularly from Juliette Binoche , is superb . Thankfully a step backward from the moral abyss represented in Funny Games . 	Though challengingly cryptic at times , Code Unknown still manages to resonate .
fast and the furious tokyo drift Tokyo Drift 's single contribution to the F & F formula comes with the word 'Drift , ' which is n't just a reference to what your attention might do while you 're watching this flashy , dull movie . OK , they squeezed one more lap out of this franchise . It 's been a fun ride , but it 's time to shut things down . If you get my drift . The third movie in the Bad News Bears series , a notable turkey , went to Japan . That trip spells certain doom for the Fast and the Furious franchise as well . The thin story and thinner characters are just setups for the race sequences , which are punctuated by lavish parties where lithe women seem to outnumber the guys by a 5-to-1 ratio . As for the racing sequences , they might be thrilling if they were n't so chaotically edited . The only Drift you 'll experience is the one towards sleep . Having lived through many a Minnesota winter , call me unimpressed to see a bunch of toy cars swerving wildly around city streets . ... the movie 's striking setting and compelling lead performance ensure that it remains a slight cut above its immediate predecessor . Padded with relatively unknown actors , `` Tokyo Drift '' is more of an actors ' showcase than fully fleshed-out movie . In Stunt Drivers Gone Wild 3 , the plot stays the same although the style of driving differs slightly . 	Eye-popping driving sequences coupled with a limp story and flat performances make this Drift an adequate follow-up to the previous Fast and Furious installments . Strictly for the racing crowd and fans of the first two films .
the ides of march George Clooney officially passes the impish matinee idol torch to Ryan Gosling in this smart , hella-cool ( does Clooney waste his time on any other kind of movie these days ? ) political drama . You expect better from George Clooney The Ides of March , George Clooney 's despairing political drama set against the backdrop of a bruising Ohio Democratic primary , presents us with a most unsentimental education . The plot is somewhat theatrical , but the stellar cast brings it to life . Clooney 's static and formal visual style matches the false intimacy of any workplace : people talking to each other about ideas , sharing secrets and betraying each other behind the scenes . Just about every other scene in the film is a simple pleasure unto itself between the equally confident writing , direction and performances . This is an actor 's film first and foremost and Clooney elicits strong performances across the board . The acting is heavyweight , as are the moral questions about the personal cost of serving the greater good that propel the story with an unstoppable force . This is intelligent filmmaking , and a provocative moral fable . It may not be perfect , but it stands as one of the better , most realistic movies about the way we elect our leaders . Smart and solidly entertaining , thanks to one of the year 's top ensemble casts working at the top of its game . 	While not exactly exposing revelatory truths , The Ides of March is supremely well-acted drama that moves at a measured , confident clip .
mean machine Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma . Boasts not a single moment that 's either fresh or credible ; it 's just a rehash of material that 's been done to death several times before . ... a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard . Another incomprehensible trash explosion from the Guy Ritchie school of cinematic slugfests . Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . Some of the acting is average , the direction is below average at times , and the writing is way below average most of the time . The formula is familiar but enjoyable . 	Despite some genuine wit , this crowd pleaser is filled with too many cliches .
pom wonderful presents the greatest movie ever sold It 's surprising that The Greatest Movie Ever Sold plays so entertainingly , given that Spurlock 's quest is essentially beside the point . Delightfully entertaining and downright informative , Morgan Spurlock only loses control of his experiment in product placement when he turns his investigation inward , towards himself . I did n't laugh as much as some , but I have to give him credit for continuing to bring a humorous and entertaining viewpoint to non-fiction film with his gimmicky experiments . A strong gimmick , but it does n't quite hang together as a documentary as well as it might . As a social experiment for the effects of marketing , the results of The Greatest Movie Ever Sold might hold some weight ; as an entity unto itself , it 's in limbo . I wish it was a little funnier - or more pointed . It 's provocative ; it could be more so . The results are absolutely hilarious , maybe even funnier than Super Size Me Spurlock 's movie is n't nearly as daring as he thinks it is , and for sheer audacity , it does n't come close to a stunt Dana Carvey pulled on his short-lived ( and brilliant ) mid-1990s TV show . [ Spurlock 's ] affable , regular-guy shtick works well here , and he scatters the movie with such gleeful ads for his sponsors ' products that , if his documentary work ever dries up , his next career choice is obvious . Spurlock is the right filmmaker for this sort of tongue-in-cheek look at pop cultural excesses . 	The Greatest Movie Ever Sold plays smartly to Spurlock 's strengths , and the result is a breezy , albeit not particularly enlightening documentary .
vincere Masterly directed . Powerful and tragic . Pure cinema . It 's a real treat to see this provocative examination of the life of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini . As Dalser , Giovanna Mezzogiorno delivers a passionate , ho-holds-barred performance . Filippo Timi is equally good as the bullish , blustering Mussolini . The screenplay is unkind to lead actor Giovanna Mezzogiorno , requiring her to replay the same obsessive behaviour in less-than-inspiring locales , and all the film 's energy just fizzles out . The effect of Mezzogiorno 's quiet acting is similar to people who whisper all the time , forcing you to lean closer to hear what they 're saying . If Bellocchio 's film were nothing but a recreation of a forgotten historical footnote , it would stand as an accomplished bit of work and the discussion would end there . But crafting a skillful period drama is only the beginning of the filmmaker 's ambition The movie , a near-masterpiece , is a monument to intoxication : of sexual conquest , of military conquest , and , most of all , of cinema . The film could have benefited from a more straightforward style of story telling and not co-screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio 's gimmicky , almost fantasy-like stylings . Writer-director Bellocchio is just as fascinated with the emotional temperature of Italy in the Mussolini years as he is with the travails of Ida Dalser at the hands of her beloved Il Duce . The film is beautifully well-mounted . The locations , the sets , the costumes , everything conspire to re-create the Rome of that time . It provides a counterpoint to the usual caricature of Mussolini . A movie whose audacious editing fully captures the hot and heavy relationships between past and present , sex and politics , reality and , yes , cinema . 	Part political treatise , part melodrama , Marco Bellocchio 's Mussolini biopic forsakes historical details in favor of absorbing emotion -- and provides a showcase for a stunning performance from Giovanna Mezzogiorno .
the twilight saga breaking dawn part 2 `` Breaking Dawn , Part 2 '' expands with a full intensity of force , stronger and more epic than the films that led to this impactful finale . Director Bill Condon infuses the final entry with a refreshing balance of fun , vibrancy , action , humor and genuine emotion , making Part 2 the best of the bunch , by far . Rather than repeat past mistakes by handling author Stephenie Meyer 's supernatural love story with kid gloves , this `` Twilight '' cuts loose and is as playful as a puppy . `` Breaking Dawn , Part 2 '' does n't end the series on an especially strong note , but it ends it . Let 's count our blessings . Somehow the final film has stuff to say about love , friendship and loyalty that works . In terms of providing plenty of bang for one 's buck , Breaking Dawn Part 2 definitely ends the franchise on a high note . Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine , smooth style . He gives fans all the lovely flowers , conditioned hair and lightly erotic , dreamy kisses they deserve . Tellingly , it 's when Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg veer away from Stephenie Meyer 's turgid text that Breaking Dawn , Part 2 actually comes to life and turns into something bold and outrageous . Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg are n't afraid to play fast and loose with Meyer 's story , and that 's a good thing . You just wish they 'd done it more often . Director Bill Condon makes up for his rather lacklustre adaptation of the first half of Stephenie Meyer 's concluding novel Breaking Dawn with a full-throated Part 2 . 	It 's the most entertaining Twilight , but that 's not enough to make Breaking Dawn Part 2 worth watching for filmgoers who do n't already count themselves among the franchise converts .
boondock saints ii all saints day Mindlessly entertaining on occasion , but lacks the refreshing pizzazz and clever surprises found in the original . Its pretentious editing style and wooden performances get frustrating rather quickly . Imagine Quentin Tarantino if he got his brow lowered . A throwback picture that returns you to the late '90s , when every third filmmaker thought he was the next Quentin Tarantino . Personally , I loved it . Writer-director Troy Duffy needs to YouTube himself a new idea or two , because his variations on themes provided by Quentin Tarantino and Guy `` RocknRolla '' Ritchie are pure mold . It 's as if writer/director Troy Duffy threw every idea he had at the wall , creating a very messy wall . I will not defend it as a good movie , but I have to say , I had a pretty good time at it . The plot is an afterthought , the performances given with a wink and a clip-emptying flourish . If Duffy 's decade away has proved to be a humbling experience , you would n't know it from this bloated follow-up , which tonally goes all over the place , but its primary direction is over the top . Duffy is a smart filmmaker who knows what his mostly male fanbase will want to see in a sequel , while also wearing most of his obvious influences on his sleeve . 	This sequel to the cult favorite The Boondock Saints is more of the same -- unoriginal , absurd , violent , over-the-top , and occasionally mean-spirited .
observe and report [ A ] startling portrait of knee-jerk ignorance , obliviousness , and mean-spiritedness ... Rogen 's wholehearted devotion to the character imbues him with a solid reality , if a miserable one ... Even for those who relish no-holds-barred humor , there 's a point when the most outrageous , caustic comedy can slide from cutting and absurd to just plain mean . Though it 's often darkly amusing , it would be a mistake to label it as an out and out comedy and what it most certainly is not is a less family friendly version of Paul Blart : Mall Cop . A downright dumb film [ It ] has its laughs , but also has its moments where you 're ca n't help but shake your head , saddened or appalled that someone thought this was funny . The tone of the film wavers queasily , though intentionally , between slapstick and shock . Does this film warrant one star for being so ugly , violent , misogynistic , sexist and racist - or five stars for being a daring and disturbing study of the violence , ugliness , sexism and racism of the ordinary American male ? If you laugh at all - which I admittedly did - it is sometimes laughing at the political/social incorrectness of [ the main character ] , and sometimes laughing at the sheer audacity of the film . How much you 're entertained will likely depend on your own taste as well as your appreciation for Hill 's subversion of feel-good Hollywood norms . Offbeat and violent with laughs that frequently stick in the throat , this is n't Knocked Up but if the idea of Napoleon Dynamite meets First Blood appeals , you 'll go home smiling . 	Though it has a mean streak , and does not cater to all tastes , Observe and Report has gut-busting laughs and a fully committed Seth Rogen in irresistible form .
wake in fright Orchestrates landscape , music , demonic faces , and lots of blood , sweat , and vomit into a stark bacchanalia of men having fun . Brilliantly directed by Kotcheff , the film has the disorienting and menacing quality of Joseph Losey films such as Accident and The Servant . `` Wake in Fright '' is true horror . This movie gets under your skin . Wake in Fright is an absolute must-see for fans of cult , off-kilter cinema . Shocking , credible and hard to forget . A riveting film with exceptional relevance today in its cultural veracity and its observation of not just outback Australian society ( if you can call it that ) , but in human nature . Animal lovers , beware . Few films were ever so bright and so dark at once . Wake in Fright remains powerful both as a portrait of a particular place at a particular time and as a potent assertion of the country 's mindset . 	A disquieting classic of Australian cinema , Wake in Fright surveys a landscape both sun-drenched and ruthlessly dark .
cherry blossoms hanami If she does n't quite go the distance - resonance needs richer characterisation , origami finer scissors - Cherry Blossoms is still a touching , tangibly personal chamber movie . A painterly , contemplative , poignant drama of a man 's journey of self-discovery to Japan . A beautiful tissue-paper piece of art that falls to shreds should you so much as blow upon it It 's a gentle lesson in facing life 's hardships with acceptance rather than grief . All but remaking the 1953 art-house classic Tokyo Story in its first third , Cherry Blossoms fortunately sidesteps rank mimicry in favor of wry homage and something more . This is a sweet-natured piece , and though the final section in Tokyo itself is sentimental and over-extended , there are poignant , mordant insights . Yearning for Ozu , Drrie stops off at cute , and parks . Though touching , Dorrie 's cross-cultural tale is too soft and sentimental to be on the same league as her two influences , Ozu and McCarey , but it should encourage viewers to revisit Tokyo Story , a landmark work in film history . Doris Dorrie 's bittersweet film is a story of mourning and the futility of trying to recover something lost . If you have ever seen Yasujiro Ozu 's masterpiece Tokyo Story -- one of the greatest films ever made -- you may respond to Doris Drrie 's Cherry Blossoms , which is a kind of homage . 	This mature and eloquent meditation on grief and loss sports measured performances and moments of humor .
28 days later The movie 's craft makes the dread of a killer virus contagious : viewers may feel they have come down with a case of secondhand SARS or sympathetic monkeypox . The movie is derivative as hell , but it 's also blazingly well-made , and it moves at a ferocious clip . Garland 's script is taut and gritty , but it 's not airtight ; if Boyle gave us time to think , he 'd lose us . Instead , he scares us ( metaphorically ) out of our wits . The genuine article , a hard-core horror picture from start to finish ... Prepare to get seriously stressed . This is an effective examination of what survival really entails - and it knows that the answers are n't necessarily pleasant . The film itself seems to exist in a state of perpetual imbalance ... between life and death , the real and the surreal , civilization and chaos . In this third act , Boyle loses the genuine tension and anxiety that came so naturally before . The end result still lacks a coherent sense of what the film is trying to achieve . A bloody disappointment . With its B-movie sensibility , 28 Days Later is a tidy horror opus . 	Kinetically directed by Danny Boyle , 28 Days Later is both a terrifying zombie movie and a sharp political allegory .
pokemon 4ever Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ? If your idea of fun is gargling vinegar , do n't miss the fourth full-length Pokemon feature film . The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance . It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it . A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace . A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan . 	Only for diehard Pokemon fans .
black christmas Unfortunately for those hoping for shower scenes and other R-rated shenanigans , there 's only one and it 's pretty lame . A modern horror movie featuring a non-ironic shower scene is far less knowing than it pretends to be . Oh , how painfully incompetent this movie is . Connoisseurs of trashy moviemaking are left with a bland slasher film , filled with a bad guy who lacks menace , a script that lacks humor and several hot young characters who have the nerve to go throughout the picture without taking their clothes off . 'T is the season to enjoy some bloodshed with your eggnog , right ? Not in this case . It 's desperately punch-yourself-in-the-face awful in every single way . Why oh why could n't Billy gouge my eyes out ? full review in Greek Let 's be clear : The new Black Christmas is n't in any way scary , realistic or well acted , but Morgan , who cocreated the Final Destination series , knows how to stage an elaborate kill for laughs . One for real horror-buffs only . Dank , stupid and -- the most unpardonable of sins -- extraordinarily tedious . 	A gratuitous remake of the 1974 slasher , Black Christmas pumps out the gore and blood with zero creativity , humor , or visual flair .
flirting with disaster When I caught this modern-day screwball comedy in theaters I did n't think much of it , and it 's even less appealing now . Um elenco afiado , personagens atpicos e situaes bizarras contribuem para tornar este filme uma comdia surpreendentemente eficaz . A brilliant , underrated comedy , featuring one of the more inspired comic screenplays in recent years . It established David O. Russell as a major voice in Hollywood . The film is n't particularly deep , but it 's well written , well acted , and often laugh-out-loud funny . Boasting a clever title , this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology , with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents . This whacked-out road comedy about a young man 's search for his real parents takes any number of unexpected turns , most of them bitingly funny . Russell 's anarchic comedy comes up with some doozy ideas , and some of the comedy is clever and on the mark . There are conventions in this sort of story , and Russell seems to violate most of them . He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own . The perpetual motion is a deliciously hysterical rush . This offbeat , documentary-like comedy becomes geometrically funnier as it goes along . The neurotic frenzy threatens to annoy , but Russell 's edgy , abbreviated style generates farcical comic friction without sacrificing character . 	Darkly funny , solidly cast , and surprisingly thoughtful , Flirting with Disaster proved David O. Russell 's Spanking the Monkey was no fluke .
une femme de menage The film is extremely well-acted . Berri makes very personal works about men who learn something about themselves rather late in life -- something important -- and The Housekeeper continues to analyze this very worthy theme . It 's a slight film , well-acted by Bacri and Emilie Dequenne . A lovely film about sadness and mess , both inside and out , and how we are able to make ourselves feel better - temporarily A modest , at times downright tiny , film . Yet its melancholy sense of humor touched me in unexpected ways . The stars hold your interest . Both Bacri and Dequenne are surprisingly effective in their performances and manage to sell us on their chemistry . Dequenne fills the free-spirited role of Laura adequately enough . But there 's precious little chemistry or understanding as to why she 's attracted to Jacques ... Its love story engages both the heart and the head . It 's refreshing to see a film about nothing but human emotion . 	Nuanced performances and an understated tone make The Housekeeper transcend its familiar premise .
snowpiercer The production design is sharp and unique , though the movie itself is not without its flaws . ... the kind of taut action sci-fi thriller that it really needs to be seen on a big screen to get the full experience . ... a bloody , limb-severing action film with a bitterly malevolent view of the species . Loftily pretentious , though curiously amusing arthouse action movie . Snowpiercer is a strange and colourful beast : messy , uneven and full of weird indulgences and dangling plot threads . But by God it 's good fun . This is Snowpiercer , one of the most uniquely fascinating , exciting , and disturbing science fiction films to come along in a good while . Snowpiercer alternates between sudden violence , high camp , and heavy-handed political allegory with breakneck speed , and even when its disjoined plot mechanics seem a little too convenient , it 's brimming with new cinematic technique . Once Mr. Bong sets his monorail in motion the movie assumes an irresistible momentum , accelerated by nonstop mayhem , gallows humor and an immersive visual style that possesses a heady sense of the steam-punk Apocalypse . A thought provoking science fiction masterpiece ... It 's the most inventive science-fiction picture in years , the most original action film in a decade and perhaps the most all-around entertaining movie so far this year . 	Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacular for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters .
taken Tries to be a big smart action movie even though it 's utterly ludicrous . The fights are occasionally very cool , but it 's far easier to find another decent action movie to watch than it is to sit through one couched in such lazy , bigoted storytelling . Bringing the same screen presence and gravity that he has to more serious roles like those in Schindler 's List and Kinsey , Liam Neeson turns the relatively generic Taken into an above-average action movie . ... a contemporary action masterpiece that surely ranks alongside the best that the genre has to offer ... What drags this movie down is the character at the center of it . The action is engaging but rarely exciting ; the drama heftier but still far from convincing . One of the most ruthlessly efficient and sheerly entertaining hardcore action films to come along in a long time . The film 's premise is obviously a little shaky , but if you 're looking for straight out , cold , hard action than there is nothing better for you than Taken . Taken is batty but briskly paced . The film is never boring . It is , however , completely preposterous . 	Taken is undeniably fun with slick action , but is largely a brainless exercise .
intimate strangers 2003 Focusing on the expressive repression on his actors ' faces , and keeping his camera so close to his subjects that you share their sense of wilful withdrawal from everything around them , Leconte keeps you riveted to the screen . One day we 're going to look back and wonder how we never quite noticed how very good Patrice Leconte is . As a modest conflation of mystery , melodrama and witty romance , Leconte 's tale of intimacy and aloneness has its definite charms . We wish the best for William , and however it turns out , his is the journey worth following . A movie that would make a good play . 'Intimate Strangers ' is a charming French romance that unravels with mounting intrigue . While Intimate Strangers is by no means an embarrassment to French filmmaker Patrice Leconte , it 's nonetheless a letdown after his last project , the wise and witty Man on the Train . Unlikely couples always make the screen 's best ones and Luchini and Bonnaire are superb in this story of loneliness , longing and the desire to start over . Captivating ... this sharp , seductive fable of psychological liberation is a welcome addition to the impressive body of work by one of the smartest of contemporary filmmakers . Sandrine Bonnaire , who last worked with Leconte on `` Hire '' is wonderfully mysterious , but it is Luchini , the ' '' Hire '' apparent , ' who steals the show 	Intimate Strangers is Hitchcockian noir with a Gallic twist : Rather than simply imitating the genre 's form , director/screenwriter Patrice Leconte delves into the underlying psychological drama .
bridget jones the edge of reason The sight of Colin Firth running through a meadow in slow motion is worth the price of admission . Zellweger enchants but the follow-up lacks charm . Edge of Reason is less a film than a series of non-stop embarrassments set to a sunny soundtrack . For truth-in-advertising purposes , the second Bridget Jones film probably should have been subtitled 'No Reason for It , Except to Cash in On the Success of the First Movie . ' The modest charms of Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason are a triumph of performance , production , and adaptation over the empty-calorie dither of its source material . [ N ] othing but a celebration of women-as-morons , aren't-they-cute ? ... ... le fric aussi a ses raisons que l'ge de raison n'ignore pas . [ Zellweger 's ] never allowed to be quite as human , quite as pained . She 's only allowed to be ridiculous . Even though it was enjoyable , there are big holes in it ; there 's absolutely nothing that would lead anyone to believe that Bridget and Mark have anything in common . The outrageous character Renee Zellweger has crafted is so dynamic and funny she 's able to hold the sequel together . 	Edge of Reason is a predictable continuation to the Bridget Jones story , with too much slapstick and silliness .
10007985-happening Trying to understand the thought process of writer and director M. Night Shyamalan is akin to analyzing Jell-O . What keeps it wiggling and what binds it together ? This particular circumstance also had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe . Feeble gust of an environmental horror story . Another disappointment from M , despite some disturbing violence and chilly moments . This major studio release asks the question , how long can you survive on past glories ? Shame on Shyamalan . Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous . The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method . At first , a great deal happens , then nothing much happens for quite some time , then something so underwhelming happens that one is left wondering , 'Did that really just happen ? ' There seem to be a lot of people gunning for Philadelphia 's own M. Night Shyamalan , and The Happening will give them more ammo . The greatest excuse yet to get that anti-M. Night petition started . The last thing we want is a future of Shyamalan films with the knowledge that we all could have done something sooner . Portraying moments of drama and danger with a Hitchcockian lack of ceremony , Shyamalan 's mundane depictions of tragedy create a quiet but weighty resonance . ... some nice creepy moments -- but other moments , and more , of ( presumably ) unintended humor . 	The Happening begins with promise , but unfortunately descends into an incoherent and unconvincing trifle .
catch a fire When someone makes a movie , a quarter of a century from now , about the American occupation of Iraq , it 's going to look like Catch a Fire , and it 's going to be enraging . The action , political intrigue and marital tensions ( which prove critical as the story unfolds ) never quite coalesce into a compelling whole . The rough trip of South African anti-apartheid hero Patrick Chamusso from apolitical worker to galvanized revolutionary and the brutal Afrikaner regime that tried to contain him . A thought-provoking depiction of the process whereby self-righteous zealots who use barbaric tactics and torture to achieve their goals actually create more terrorists . Catch a Fire ignites , incites and informs as few other movies of the fall do . A story of bigotry , hatred , rebellion , forgiveness and finally , healing . Moderately moving but not truly shattering , as you might expect of a film with this theme ; ... its impact is more intellectual than visceral . Even through the lens of director Phillip Noyce 's sympathetic camera eye , it 's impossible to keep the term 'terrorist ' at bay while watching Catch a Fire . Save for a committed performance by Derek Luke in the film 's lead role , there 's little that 's terribly remarkable about Catch a Fire . Director Philip Noyce and screenwriter Shawn Slovo lean heavily into the thriller aspects of Chamusso 's story , leaving much of the nuance to actors Derek Luke , Bonnie Henna and Tim Robbins . 	No stranger to the political thriller , director Phillip Noyce tackles apartheid and terrorism with experienced gusto , while Derek Luke and Tim Robbins hand in nuanced performances .
ten canoes A comic mystery with a whimsical , unique tone . It 's not every director with a camera and curiosity about his fellow man who 'd try a stunt like this . And it 's not every viewer who 'll be content just to watch and listen as the story slowly unfolds . Once you become accustomed to the mystical vocabulary describing a world without modern science and technology , it amounts to using different terms to describe universal experience . Gulpilil is the canny , subtle and funny narrator of 10 Canoes , a film of unutterable beauty , hypnotic fascination and universal humanity . A film that testifies to the multicultural mood of our own moment in time . ... a top-flight example of cinematic storytelling ... It taunts us with resolution and mysteries , then slaps our hand for reaching out for a conclusion . That 's a natural expectation that the filmmakers are happy to subvert . Sometimes all it takes to bridge the chasm of eons is a little humor . Audacious and impressive , but challenging work , requiring steadfast concentration . One of the most arresting and original offerings in Cannes this year . 	Ten Canoes combines adventure , comedy , and anthropology to explore an Aborigine folk tale both fallibly human and legendary . Helmer Rolf de Heer depicts a barely represented oral tradition with a clean style .
tomorrowland 2015 While Tomorrowland 's sermonizing left me feeling grumpy ... it may well have an entirely different effect on impressionable children . Deficient in magic and decidedly short on enchantment , as well as tiresomely preachy . An awkward , labored narrative structure derails any chance for Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof to explore the progressive concepts they 're so keen to introduce . The ultimate in corporate synergy . It 's important to note that `` Tomorrowland '' is not disappointing in the usual way . It 's not another glib , phoned-in piece of franchise mediocrity but rather a work of evident passion and conviction . What it is n't is in any way convincing or enchanting . Brad Bird presents a gorgeously wrought , hopeful future vision in Tomorrowland , infusing the family film with enough entertaining action and retro-themed whiz bang to forgive an awkward opening and third-act weakness . Exhilarating on every level . I would be lying if I said that Tomorrowland did n't get to me during the first half . [ full review in Spanish ] A conventional , redundant story that has nothing new to tell . [ full review in Spanish ] Tomorrowland is weakened by its own relentless optimism . 	Ambitious and visually stunning , Tomorrowland is unfortunately weighted down by uneven storytelling .
how to lose friends and alienate people Hollywood took a mediocre script and hired Pegg , relying on his charms alone to carry the picture . Sorry , it just does n't work that way . The movie has to be good too . By some bizarre alchemy , How to Lose Friends and Alienate People has been translated to the screen as a Judd Apatow romantic comedy crossed with The Devil Wears Prada . How to Lose Friends wants to see itself as a champion of humanity over glitz and a puckish puncturer of egos . But while culled from Young 's disastrous experiences at Vanity Fair , the movie is strictly Us Weekly quality . It seems Weide and Pegg were determined to make good on their title How to Lose Friends & Alienate People . You can sum up their results in two words : mission accomplished . Despite the best efforts of Pegg and Fox the movie is only mildly entertaining I 'm told that several of these characters are easily recognisable to insiders , but outside that small coterie there 's still a great deal to enjoy about Sidney 's fish-out-of-water exploits . Not as smart or as satirical as you might hope , but an enjoyable and often funny look at a mad , mad , mad , mad world . Not every comic idea works , but the movie is often wickedly funny ... Any movie in which the hero accidentally kills a Chihuahua ca n't be a total loss , but How To Lose Friends & Alienate People comes pretty darned close . It 's ultimately difficult to recall a cinematic endeavor that crashes and burns with the ferocity of How to Lose Friends & Alienate People ... 	A decent performance from Pegg in a disappointing film . Neither sharp nor satirical , Weide 's adaptation relies too heavily on slapstick , and misses the point of the source material in the process .
10008754-flawless The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movie Flawless goes a long way toward overcoming the film 's slack , leisurely pacing . Flawless is anything but . It may not be as insensitive as Blood Diamond 's inane examination of the diamond industry and its accompanying slave trade , but Flawless 's utilization of the issue as a mere diversionary plot point is nonetheless plenty distasteful . You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing , and , to be quite frank , the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly . But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors . Flawless , directed with a fine eye by Michael Radford , is a diamond-heist thriller that will make you nostalgic for the smart , classy caper films of a certain era . At least the picture 's title is apt -- as a work of preposterous implausibility it is , indeed , without any redeeming flaw . How can an actress with Moore 's carnal screen presence be so underused by carnally minded Hollywood ? Calling a diamond-heist movie Flawless is a valiant choice - especially when it 's anything but . Suspense is essential to this genre , but here you could n't care less what happens next . For about 100 of its 108 minutes , this film treats the viewer to a stylish , suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly , money-grubbing corporate types . The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare . Almost everything about the film is second-rate : the direction , the plotting , the intrusive modernist production design . 	Michael Caine 's excellent performance makes Flawless something more than an average heist movie .
jennifers body Like a sloppy episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Jennifer is dead-eyed and impassive , but a good actress might yet have played her in a lively , knowing way . Fox 's dead-eyed impassiveness seems all too much her own . [ Cody 's ] glib teen-hip dialogue mostly feels like self-conscious splatter over a sorely lackluster scare flick . It is n't thrilling . Fox ca n't act . The backchat is more filthy than funny . Occasionally aimless direction is saved by a witty script from Diablo Cody . It 's not the worst scary movie of the year . In fact , there are some flashes of what could have been a really cool horror film . But Juno scribe Diablo Cody 's script is inconsistent in tone , crude instead of edgy and generally dull instead of hip and cool . Jennifer 's Body has more to say about the dynamics of teenaged female friendship , sexual power games and the trials of adolescence than many a more self-consciously worthy film . You have to give Cody and her cohorts credit for trying to pump some new blood into a stale genre , and there are moments of inspired cleverness ... but they 're not frequent or sustained enough . It 's tailor-made for screenings at midnight and slumber parties . Enjoy some quirk with your blood splatter . While certainly not the most innovative of horror comedy flicks , Jennifer 's Body still has some pizazz , thanks to Diablo Cody 's pen . 	Jennifer 's Body features occasionally clever dialogue but the horror/comic premise fails to be either funny or scary enough to satisfy .
repulsion a riveting horror thriller , one that cuts through the simple and comforting categories of good and evil Haunting and ominous from first frame to last , Polanski 's first English film is a masterpiece , a subtle horror tale about the descent into madness of an isolated , sexually repressed woman , stunningly played by Catherine Deneuve who was only 22 at the time One of the most frightening and disturbing pictures ever made . ... a masterfully conducted portrait in madness ... This is an austere , scary , and timeless Grand Guignol work -- one with little dialogue . At second glance , or as often as a moviegoer can bear to peek through his knotted fingers , it is a Gothic horror story , a classic chiller of the Psycho school and approximately twice as persuasive . An intense psychological thriller from the master of the genre . Filled with indelible images and punishing sound design , Repulsion casts a shadow over everything from Eraserhead to Black Swan , but there 's nothing quite like the real thing . A story of sexual repression of such magnitude necessarily treads on Freudian ground but Polanski resists any urge to plumb the psychological depths of his tortured protagonist . A potent cocktail of sexual repression , madness and violence , this chiller is one of Roman Polanski 's best . 	Roman Polanski 's first English film follows a schizophrenic woman 's descent into madness , and makes the audience feel as claustrophobic as the character .
1152019-good night and good luck George Clooney makes a bold move and raises tough issues in the meticulously recreation of a seminal chapter in television history . Clooney 's excellent film uses the past to make today 's media and their audiences address their responsibilities . While the harmfulness of McCarthyism is a significant part of the film , it approaches the subject by examining the power of the media . Good Night , and Good Luck . is n't memorable , even in the short run , because it creates a desire for information that Clooney has no intention of fulfilling . George Clooney nous livre en dfinitive un superbe plaidoyer qui ne passe pas par quatre chemins pour remettre en question le rle de la tlvision . Clooney continues to improve as both a writer and director , showing huge advancement from his underwhelming 2002 helming debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . Good night , and goodluck is a stunning , uniquely timely , piece that gloriously interweaves real behind the story stories 'tween Murrow & Senator McCarthy ... We may recognize that the film is something of a nicotine-stained hagiography ; but such recognition does n't dilute the power of the ideas that Clooney has chosen to champion . A solid achievement . Clooney drains the story of most of the stirring sentimentality and rousing rightness that could have bogged it down . 	A passionate and concise cinematic civics lesson , Good Night , And Good Luck has plenty to say about today 's political and cultural climate , and its ensemble cast is stellar .
shine a light Manages to capture the raw energy of the band . After the 14th song , casual fans feel guilty that their energy is flagging while then-63 Mick 's still huffing on A celebration of the Stones and star Mick Jagger , Scorsese 's Shine a Light is an exuberant concert film that captures vividly the charisma and energy of the vet band but should n't be considered a docu as there 's little footage or interviews -- by design . Takes full advantage of heavy camera coverage and top-notch sound to create an invigorating musical trip down memory lane , as well as to provoke gentle musings on the wages of aging and the passage of time . A buoyant , light-hearted encore of a movie , paying tribute to the Stones as indefatigable elder statesmen who still go out every night and put on a great show . He brings all his skills as a filmmaker to the film , but Scorsese did not achieve the monumental dimensions of his movie from cinematic savoir faire . Shine a Light is huge because the Stones are giants . A wild performance by Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones , who really know how to give it all they 've got . Scorsese captures the Stones at their ancient , un-ironic best , bluesy showmen who leave it all on the stage every night , never for a moment letting on that they 're playing , for the 10,000th time , 40-year-old hits . Shine a Light combines his foreknowledge with the versatility of great cinematographers so that it essentially seems to have a camera in the right place at the right time for every element of the performance . The Stones aspire to project physical and musical agelessness , and a reinvented rebellion switched from anti-patriarchal authority to one against Father Time . You do n't need a weathered man to know which way the wind blows . 	It may offer little new for fans , but Martin Scorsese 's document of the Rolling Stones ' electrifying live show should provide satisfaction to audiences .
jungle book 2 Same characters , same heroes , same villain , many of the same songs and the same conclusion , just different voices joking and singing away . Shows little weakness in its competent construction and animation . Rather , its major problem involves how generic the whole thing is . Who , exactly , was clamoring for sequels to these Disney classics ? In any format ? Whoever you are , you certainly have a lot of explaining to do . An innocent , entertaining film that boasts big names in lead roles . Maybe it 'll work as a rental for the kids ? Attempts to recreate the nostalgic magic of the original film and fails miserably -- it 's completely run-of-the-mill . Disney 's The Jungle Book 2 is a flea market of cheap ploys and meaningless ideas designed to rob parents of hard-earned money ... It ca n't shake the impression of a video premiere stretched to big-screen size . A pathetic excuse for an animated feature , with only slightly more than an hour of action , a thin plot that returns to very familiar details and themes , and only two new songs . This jungle has no rhythm at all . 	This inferior rehash of The Jungle Book should have gone straight to video .
up and down A bleakly funny and trenchant comedy . Those comfortable with quickdraw transitions between brief light and heavy grit will find much to dig . Hrebejk 's post-Soviet Czech Republic is more than a little like the American South , a conquered territory rife with old wounds and fresh indignities . It 's been a long time since a movie allowed so many diverse narratives to fold into so unexpected , unified and satisfying a story . Captures Prague life with a fervor that 's comical but a longing that 's serious ; no one is easy to pigeonhole . Hrebejk deftly brings the stories together , and does so without delving into sentimentality . Hrebejk and his screenwriter , Petr Jarchovsky , understand their characters too well to judge them . An ambitious premise that only just falls short of genius . At its simplest , Up and Down moves along nicely , following the erratic fortunes of its heroes , and it contains some good performances . The clumsy humor does n't translate well . 	A tragi-comic exploration of the universal search for stability in post-Communist Prague .
practical magic An absolute waste of time . So misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . A witch comedy so slapdash , plodding , and muddled it seems to have had a hex put on it . Although I enjoyed portions of the movie , I ca n't wholeheartedly recommend something with such an unfortunate and dissatisfying conclusion ! Uneven adaptation of lyrical novel . Practically magic , but not quite . A disappointing brew of slick commercial moviemaking and old-fashioned romantic fantasy ! Hocus pocus without focus . A Halloween movie with amorous themes but is such a hodgepodge that it serves as neither an effective , Charles -Addams- style spoof of the supernatural genre nor a convincing romantic comedy . If nothing else , the screenwriters deserve recognition for the nerve it took to employ what must be the most outrageously lazy writer 's device in the history of cinema . 	Comedy , romance , and humor mix with unsatisfying results .
1074316-scream The end product , while predictable and gory , does manage to be as good as prior slasher films ... it just could do a lot better . The film was written by Kevin Williamson , and his screenplay is smart as it is hip . The image of Barrymore on her portable phone , with her sweater sleeves draped over her palms , in the house with the big picture windows , has already become one of the great indelible images of the 1990 's . Remains a highly polished piece of meta-slasher mayhem . At last , a horror movie to shout about ! Its commercial success was well-justified . It is the cream of a pretty bad crop Craven is obviously having a ball here , and it 's impossible not to sit back and go grinning into this dark , gory ride . Turns slasher flicks into slapstick . It 's been a long time since a teen-slasher movie has offered up anything but dull buckets of gore . With Scream , the genre reclaims its roots . 	Horror icon Wes Craven 's subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly , witty , and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself , even if it 's a little too cheeky for some .
horse whisperer The Horse Whisperer is deeply respectful of its subject matter . This is a beautiful movie , but not for those in a hurry . A film as rich in its visual presentation as it is in its emotional resonance . Booker 's way with people and horses is at once mesmerizing and unbelievably simple . His story of patience , love , and simple contact is a nice parable for our time . By the way it 's shot and directed , it 's easy to see how people can spend their entire lives in the country . What works in The Horse Whisperer works VERY well . Tutors us in the art of slowing down , being present , and quieting the heart . Redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . It even manages to avoid some of the movie clichs you 'd expect to see in a film like this , and , surprisingly , subvert some others . For such a long meal it certainly is n't very filling . 	It might be a bit too eager to tug the heartstrings , but The Horse Whisperer is typically graceful , well-crafted Redford -- on both sides of the camera .
1152567-jarhead Like the marines in this movie , we are forced to deal with the boredom as well as the excitement . We do n't know , but we 've been told ... Mendes ' new film is far from gold . Think of Jarhead as `` Waiting for Godot '' with sunscreen . Sniper-like precision has become old-fashioned . More effective weapons only deepen the despair of war . When you make a film about the tedium of war , you run the risk of making a boring film - and Sam Mendes falls into that trap . The film itself feels a little boring and tedious . A war movie that defies the genre by expressing that even without heavy combat , the war remains a part of these men forever . We ca n't argue with the film 's tagline : 'Welcome to the suck . ' It 's not a pretty picture , but it is a lovely film . This is a very strong film with really good performances . 	This first person account of the first Gulf War scores with its performances and cinematography but lacks an emotional thrust .
10004288-running scared No one in their right minds could call this a good film , but it 's certainly unique . In the opening minutes of Running Scared , a drug deal goes bad and takes the entire movie with it . A vile disaster . A montagem eficiente , com transies intrigantes , confere ritmo ao filme , que tambm se beneficia com a atuao surpreendentemente intensa de Walker . Pena que o roteiro seja to implausvel e o final , to absurdamente ridculo . There 's something films like this reflect in our nature ... that we seem to delight in propped up monsters that give the protagonist an excuse to behave like one . Those of you hoping for a remake of the delightful Billy Crystal/Gregory Hines buddy comedy are in for something very different with this Running Scared . Ultra-violent and hardcore , it 's a worthwhile ride even though it does n't all work . races along the thin line between tense thriller and overheated , campy exploitation flick . If Running Scared sometimes looks like a storyboard sprung violently to life , Kramer 's assured direction turns that into its greatest strength in the clinches , of which there are plenty . Appallingly gross , filled with forced profanity , and atrociously edited . It 's hard to believe that this mess was made by the same man who made The Cooler . 	This film runs with frenetic energy punctuated by gratuitous violence but sorely lacks in plot , character development and stylistic flair .
cars So warm , fuzzy and passionate about its four-wheeled characters is Cars that you may start to wonder about the efficiency of evolution itself . At 116 minutes , it 's a test not of speed but endurance . It achieves the near impossible , turning cars , trucks , tractors and farm harvesters into cute Disney characters whose fates you 'll care about . I watched CARS through the windshield of my car . I 'd not been to a drive-in in years . Oh , and the movie was pretty darned good too ! a great movie that 's not just a , you 'll pardon the expression , character-driven story , but also an irresistible paean to life in the slow lane La animacin de Pixar se supera , una vez ms , a s misma , aunque no mantenga la frescura narrativa ni la originalidad de historia y personajes de sus mejores pelculas . It 's beautiful to look at . The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should . For the first time in Pixar 's young history , the meaningful lessons of the plot take a back seat to the filmmaker 's breathtaking art . Pixar maintains the lush visuals and sweet story , but the crossover is limited this time around . Perhaps the movie 's idyllic small town of Radiator Springs should have been depicted through stop-motion or traditional animation , to suggest the limits as well as the appeal of the so-called good old days . 	Cars offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story , adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers .
adventures of elmo in grouchland A lovely moral fable full of suspense , humour and music . An appeal that tops out at about age 4 . Good fun for the single digit aged set ! The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland wo n't tickle anyone much above the age of 6 . Strictly for those who are currently watching the PBS series : that is , the preschool/kindergarten audience . Most patient adults may want to strangle the impish Elmo within the first 10 minutes of this movie . If you have an Elmo fan in your life , Elmo In Grouchland is a must . The film is n't all it could be . It 's cute , diverting fun for the young 'uns , and one that features a good message to boot . Sesame Street fans will love this sweet movie . 	This fun and moral tale entertains both first-time Seasame Street watchers and seasoned veterans .
2046 It all sounds dense and intriguing in Wong 's patented , meta-Proustian manner and , of course , the movie has so much style to burn that those seated close to the screen may wish for asbestos jackets . In the mood for sublimity Beautifully shot , hypnotic film with a terrific soundtrack and lovely performances -- it wanders a bit towards the end , but by then you 'll be happy to go along with it . This is a film of surfaces , atmosphere , and fluid but delimiting time . Quite simply an incomparably sublime work of art , a triumph of lyricism over narrative in the cinema , and the most exquisite homage to the beauty of women it has ever been my privilege to witness on the screen . It 's all terribly atmospheric , and if you 're in the mood for atmosphere , 2046 delivers . It is Ziyi Zhang who owns 2046 , , pulling us in as her coquetry turns into unrequited need . She 's phenomenal in a film that 's a 'Who 's Who ' of Chinese actresses . Admittedly , there is something intoxicating about the film that keeps you going . 2046 is a must for fans of Wong Kar Wai with its subtle intrigues and interesting character studies . No one else making films today..surveys the landscape of the heart with the sensitivity , delicacy , and depth that Wong brings to 2046 . 	Director Wong Kar-Wai has created in 2046 another visually stunning , atmospheric , and melancholy movie about unrequited love and loneliness .
road to guantanamo Although its methodology raises some questions , The Road to Guantanamo provides a riveting glimpse into a heavily shrouded political and moral quagmire that deepens by the day . Perhaps it will be a strong enough reminder of what 's going on down there , un-checked and unregulated , that it will encourage those familiar with the subject to at least talk about it more with those who are n't . `` The Road to Guantanamo '' is an experiment in storytelling that proves effective and innovative . Revulsion can be an effective tool in exposing wrongdoing . But in the murky confrontation between militant Islam and the West , truth will always be the better road to freedom . While not an altogether convincing character study of the three detainees , Guantanamo is a nonetheless chilling indictment . The conception does n't work perfectly ... . Still , the film is muscular , persuasive , and necessary without being exploitative . Though compromised , what we see enacted is powerful stuff , a reminder of the casual hypocrisy of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld in his remark that the Gitmo prisoners are 'treated in accord with the Geneva Convention , for the most part . ' If we ever felt like the soldiers and interrogators seen here were in any way human , Winterbottom and Whitecross ' indictment of their behavior would hit twice as hard . As pure documentary , the film brilliantly conjures without romanticization the chaos , squalor and fragility of Pakistan on the edge of what is just about to become a war zone . As a look at the injustices blithely wrought in the name of democracy , The Road to Guantanamo comes none too soon . 	A gut-wrenching and riveting docu-drama that serves as a stinging indictment of U.S. military justice in an era of ever-increasing scrutiny .
dragonball Chintzy effects , badly overdubbed dialogue , an idiotic script and a cave set that looks exactly like the `` caves '' on log-flume rides . Admittedly , it 's never boring ... but nor is it ever logical , coherent , rational , etc . Tearing through its mystical , who-gives-a-toss storyline like a pissed bat bouncing off cave walls , Dragonball 's cocktail of cheap effects , eye-rolling cliches and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure . Uninspired and clich-ridden . Run a mile in any direction from Dragonball Evolution . It 's not aggressively bad . It 's more like a dumb , energetic puppy . The movie is at best a mixed blessing , helmer Wong moves things around quickly ( running time is only 83 minutes ) , but the film lacks the scope and style of a mythic epic and the leads are played by actors who may be too old to be teenagers . [ Chow 's ] hamminess does n't make Dragonball Evolution make more sense , but it 's a great way to cope with an otherwise inexplicable kitschfest . Fans of the best-selling Dragonball comics ( and cartoons , and videogames ... ) might have a shot at untangling the knotty dream-logic that strangles Dragonball : Evolution 's live-action adaptation . It 's just dull , dumb and depressing . 	Executed with little panache or invention , Dragonball Evolution lacks the magic that made the books upon which it was based a cult sensation .
enemy at the gates What could have been an elaborate cat and mouse game quickly becomes a High Noon rip off . After Enemy at the Gates teases us with the promise of something big , it 's hard to be happy with a small-scale story . The story hits and misses for more than two hours following its opening artillery bloodbath . Impressive visually , with great sets and a grim feel of massive tragedy . The plot is pure Hollywood bunk . Throughout the movie I could imagine Annaud , metaphorically speaking , on the brink of shooting himself and his movie in the head . It was nice that he only would up shooting himself , and Enemy at the Gates , in the foot . If Saving Private Ryan refreshed a tired genre by throwing out old war-movie conventions , it was only a matter of time before other films came along to turn its innovations into clichs all over again . The trouble with the film is that it did n't work well for long stretches . At its best , it transforms one of the turning points of World War II from a dusty historical footnote into a lean and terrifying visual extravaganza . Even with its flaws , I guess you could say that this is the best American movie ever made about a heroic Soviet sniper and his propagandist pal . 	Atmospheric and thrilling , Enemy at the Gates gets the look and feel of war right . However , the love story seems out of place .
1015287-notorious Notorious has fascinating echoes of other Hitchcock movies such as Rebecca and Psycho . A must-see or must-see-again . A glorious exercise in film style , where virtuoso camerawork combines with the characters to create a wonderful harmony of visuals and narrative -- and where the complexities of character and story exist above and beyond the dictates of genre . Gorgeously shot in luminous monochrome , it 's all wrapped up with an extremely suspenseful last reel . Notorious ( 1946 ) is a classic Hitchcockian post-war psychological suspense/thriller . The basis of the film came from the 1921 Saturday Evening Post two-part Alfred Hitchcock 's Notorious is the most elegant expression of the master 's visual style , just as Vertigo is the fullest expression of his obsessions . Stunning , smooth Hitchcock thriller benefits from Cary and Ingrid . Notorious is in the world of film noir but not of it ; it 's a tough and dark film that 's also one of the finest women 's pictures ever made . There is also , of course , virtuoso direction from the master . Bergman and Grant sizzle in this espionage tale written by Ben Hecht . While there 's little action in Notorious , there is plenty of suspense . 	Sublime direction from Hitchcock , and terrific central performances from Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant make this a bona-fide classic worthy of a re-visit .
1045992-much ado about nothing The movie is uneven , but the range is from good to outstanding . Wonderful rendering of Shakespeare 's comedy . Branagh and Thompson shine . Wish I could say the same for Keanu . Continuously enjoyable from its action-filled opening to the dazzling final shot ... A lot of fun ! Branagh does excellent bringing Shakespeare 's comedy to life . A joyous romp whose forced jollity is only occasionally wearing . Branagh 's highly entertaining and accessible take on one of the Bard 's zestiest comedies . [ Blu-ray ] Inventively celebrates the sense of heightened vitality which is at the core of all Shakespeare 's comedies . There 's much to commend in Branagh 's pruned , international version of Shakespeare 's troubling comedy . Although Kenneth Branagh 's interpretation does much to make Shakespeare 's play comprehensible , it ultimately fails to create any kind of enduring watchability . A spirited , winningly acted rendition of one of the Bard 's most popular comedies . 	Kenneth Branagh 's love for the material is contagious in this exuberant adaptation .
the book of eli On a technical level , The Book of Eli is smooth and assured . Although it feels like a parallel story taking place at the same time as THE ROAD , this post-apocalyptic thriller has the opposite effect , actually getting less complex and interesting as it goes along . At least it starts out well . It 's not a great film , but has moments of brilliance . Jennifer Beals is outstanding and the lack of heavy-handed religious grandstanding is a welcome touch . Bad enough to be an end-of-genre movie ... The script is a calamity , the direction worse . `` The Book of Eli '' falls prey to several of the problems that `` The Road '' had , and while it was n't as big a failure as that film , it 's still a lot of apocalyptic wasteland to get through . It 's great to see Denzel Washington back in the saddle again , but The Book of Eli is a bit of a mess . think of this as The Road if re-imagined by the Wachowski Brothers . The landscape is all grays and browns , punctuated only by the occasional flash of a muzzle . Gripping and thought provoking entertainment . For those of us in the reading and writing business-for anyone , really , who loves the written word-the movie has a powerful resonance . It reminds us that literacy ca n't be taken for granted . One trip to the poisoned post-apocalyptic well too many 	It 's certainly uneven , and many viewers will find that its reach exceeds its grasp , but The Book of Eli finds the Hughes brothers injecting some fresh stylish fun into the kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland filmgoers have seen more than enough of lately .
sympathy for mr vengeance 2002 A stylish exercise with some agreeably weird touches , but as a whole it substitutes atmosphere for coherence or credibility . So bloody , scatologically violent and consistently shocking , it seems to have no larger purpose than itself -- which is pretty grim . Executed with style and it sets up a situation that provides some food for thought . There 's a genuine sophistication , both technically and thematically , to what Park is doing in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance . Promises to be a stylish , resonant plunge into the dark waters of despair and revenge but ends up amusing itself with ostentatious shocks . Somehow you 'd be more won over by his anti-revenge case if he did n't seem to be having such a good time making it . It is a worthy start to a trilogy and to a director who is fast establishing himself as a new light in Asian cinema . Two hours that did n't entertain much , thrill much or do much of anything ... much . Slow pace and the lack of clear definition between good and bad makes it a less immediate effort than Oldboy . The movie begins as a tragic tale of sacrifice and love ... intense and understandably moving . It gets a little less interesting when it turns into a gore-fest . 	Though Park directs with stylistic flair , this revenge thriller is more excessively gruesome than thrilling .
man with the golden gun Christopher Lee is superb , but a James Bond movie is in trouble when you 're rooting for the villain . Roger Moore 's Bond has got a rough deal over the year , but whilst this takes itself a little too lightly it has a lot going for it . This is Bond by numbers : the fast cars , fast boats and fast women are all here , but there 's little imagination at work . The best Bonds , like the car that twirls , were sly without quite getting silly . The best Bonds also had Sean Connery , whose absence is sorely felt here . The comparatively spare arrays of mechanical devices seem more a cost-cutting factor . Bond versus Herve and Dracula . How can such a thing possibly be disliked ? Not nearly one of Bond 's best adventures , but fans will find enough to enjoy . You cast Christopher Lee as a Bond villain and you find a way to blow it ? ! There 's no shortage of innuendo , action , exotic locations , or casual misogyny . Unfortunately it 's too camp and cruel an adventure to raise more than a Moore-like eyebrow . the first film that actually allowed Moore to get into the role without having to live up to Connery 	A middling Bond film , The Man With the Golden Gun suffers from double entendre-laden dialogue , a noteworthy lack of gadgets , and a villain that overshadows 007 .
u2 3d The experience of seeing a concert movie , no matter how technically remarkable , will never replace the experience of being at the show . But U2 3D comes awfully close . Represents what is far and away the most impressive use of 3-D I 've ever seen . Taking the concert film format to an extreme , U23D establishes an uncommonly intimate , occasionally surreal bond between performers and audiences . It 's such a thoroughly enthralling production that , in some ways , an actual U2 concert pales in comparison . U2 3D is no less than an electrifying , immersive marvel of music , showmanship and spectacle . As a testament to one of the few bands that actually warrants the 3D concert film treatment , U2 3D rattles and hums like no other . An elegant , dazzling and graceful concert film that captures the true spirit of a U2 show . While U2 3D delivers what it promises to , it does n't do anything further . The 3-D cameras are as enthusiastic as the U2 rock musicians . U2 3D may feel at times like a truncated greatest-hits parade , but short of being right in the thick of it , you wo n't feel or see those hits delivered more directly . 	3D transports the viewer to an intimate seat at a U2 performance , for an exhilarating musical experience at the price of a movie ticket .
marley Fans of Bob Marley 's music have plenty to celebrate with MARLEY as well as fans of great music in general . There 's nothing innovative about Marley , but it 's a fine example of traditional documentary done right . You get to know Bob Marley , and that 's terrific , but you do n't get to know his music because it 's only revealed in short clips , and that 's a shame . The tunes , flooding every frame , remain perfect . A truly human portrait of an extraordinary life . A fascinating and occasionally moving insight that humanises a legend . Outstanding , thorough , often moving documentary about the tragically short life and huge influence of musician Bob Marley ... by any fair measure , a great music documentary . Marley finally gives the world an authoritative , nonhagiographic survey of Marley 's life . The narrative does a solid job of explaining key elements of Marley 's keen sensibility , including his deep identification with outsiders and his encompassing world view . It wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads , beatific smile and durable songs of love , hope and longing . In this task it succeeds admirably . 	Kevin Macdonald 's exhaustive , evenhanded portrait of Bob Marley offers electrifying concert footage and fascinating insights into reggae 's greatest star .
the drop The power to turn a so-so script into a half-decent movie with nothing but one 's own acting prowess and personal magnetism is a mighty power indeed . The film is just three degrees off being brilliant yet is always creepingly moving , and I loved its lived-in squalor . Where did this frustrating movie go wrong ? There are multiple possible choke points . Roskam treats the material with reverence , and the working-class Brooklyn setting with a painterly eye . Bob 's world seems measured in the call of others for him to do something , his name incurred the way you 'd call out to a devoted if beat-down dog . `` Bob ! '' `` Bob ! '' But each cur will have his cure . The plot , setting and supposed twists are all mightily familiar but it 's worth a punt due to Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini . Lehane 's punchy dialogue and the brooding atmosphere keep you watching even as you fear The Drop might not amount to anything substantial but this is a film that 's just waiting to strike and tighten its screws . For all its scabby-edged brio and canine existentialism , The Drop falls just shy of genuine neo-noir nastiness . It barks , it even bites , but it fails to draw much blood from the viewer . Roskam emphasizes character and dialogue first , giving the main characters -- as well as a handful of supporters -- a strong inner life . Gripping pot-boiler crime drama . 	There 's no shortage of similarly themed crime dramas , but The Drop rises above the pack with a smartly written script and strong cast .
10010334-leaves of grass ... through it all , the two performances by Edward Norton feel natural , relaxed , utterly unlike a gimmick . The DVD extras give the film a boost with a well done `` making-of ? '' featurette and a commentary of the film by director Nelson , star Norton and producer William Migliore . Maybe too small-scale to be anything truly special , but an original and witty film that both surprises and entertains . It 's a jarringly realistic hybrid that echoes the more surreal aspects of real , rural life , and Norton walks/ambles through it all , sporting dueling personalities and distinct accents , but one very serious heart . Playing identical twin brothers who have landed on very different ends of the personality spectrum , Norton gives two bravura comic performances , shoulder-to-shoulder ... The picture loses its mind on an abrasive hunt for irreverence , twisting something securely oddball into an affected , unnecessarily toxic tale of brilliant knuckleheads living up to their Tulsa potential . As a writer-director , Nelson keeps the laughs coming at a steady pace , and never condescends to his articulate redneck characters . I could only bear 35 minutes , and I have n't walked out of anything since 'You , Me and Dupree . ' The movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition . And for that I dig it , even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone . a fitfully enjoyable but unsatisfying playground of ambition and occasional wit 	Edward Norton delivers one of his finest performances in Leaves of Grass , but he 's overpowered by the movie 's many jarring tonal shifts .
un secret A harrowing and wrenching coming-of-age story in which Franois wrestles with the question of identity . The almost egregiously deliberate pace with which Miller has infused the production ultimately turns out to be far more problematic than one might initially have suspected ... In Un Secret , French filmmaker Claude Miller expertly weaves together a family history , merging the personal and political , the celebratory and the tragic , while incorporating three distinct time periods . Not very easy to follow , but the twists and turns are gripping and emotional A structural mess that turns contrived just when it should be hitting home . I was not prepared for the climactic emotional devastation , but as all the pieces fall into place , the film crystallises as perfectly as Tania 's flawless backward high dive piercing through the clear water with beauty and precision . Makes for compelling viewing despite many familiar elements . mia allokoti domi tainias mesa se tainia poy diakoptetai apo alli tainia , ospoy sto telos ksehnas kai poio itan to mystiko , kai poios einai o allos poy soy to ekrybe , kai pote emfanistike aytos poy tha to mathei kai giati soy to lene esena stin teliki . Beautifully acted and exquisitely photographed , director Claude Miller 's superb drama , from Philippe Grimbert 's autobiographical novel , is awash with the ripples created by unlived lives . It is a deeply moving and heartfelt story that makes an indelible impression on the viewers ' hearts and minds . 	A Secret is poignant , sad , and beautifully crafted , featuring fine performances that stave off a drift toward soap opera territory .
panic room David Fincher 's Panic Room is the closest we 've come to a film worthy of the banner `` a female Die Hard . '' The 'fretful room ' is a better description of this light thriller that unfolds like `` Die Hard within a Budget . '' Foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . Panic Room is a thriller that deserves to be mentioned in the same category as a Rear Window . David Fincher has n't made a bad movie yet OK , so we never have much doubt about what will happen , but Fincher pulls out all the visual stops to crank up the heat in this tale of five people in a Manhattan house on one dark and stormy night . Panic Room is a state of the art example of solid Hollywood filmmaking . Mais um momento inspirado de David Fincher . Panic Room is pretty much all suspense ; you do n't exactly need Fiennes , Olivier and Gielgud in this one to make it work . There 's just no denying Fincher 's gifts . Give the guy a camera or two or three , millions upon millions of dollars and state-of-the-art technologies , and there 's no stopping him . 	Elevated by Fincher 's directorial talent and Foster 's performance , Panic Room is a well-crafted , above-average thriller .
like crazy The reason to see it co-stars with Anton Yelchin , around whom the project got going . Her name is Felicity Jones . Like Crazy is so intent on being untypical that it forsakes everything that a movie work , like a plot , meaningful dialogue and characters we care about . The only thing I got out of Doremus ' movie is a solid argument for tighter immigration laws . Awful in exactly the ways that indie films can be awful . All of them . A highlight of 2011 Sundance Film Fest , in its style , this intimate relationship portrait recalls some of the eraly works of the French New Wave , with a touch of Cassavetes . It 's the perfect film to force on a teenager after his or her first break-up , a lesson in How Not To Be In Love . Doremus delivers a tightly focused film that 's all the more impressive for being improvised . Beautifully romantic , frustratingly imperfect ... What we observe is words shared , looks exchanged and hearts melding , unaware of what it will take to keep them feeling whole . Engaging romantic drama with some effective directorial touches and a terrific pair of performances from Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin ... This film not only provides an effective love story . It goes well beyond that to examine the way believable characters deal with problems resulting from forced separation due to immigration policies . The emotional honesty of Like Crazy , which is comparable to Richard Linklater 's great Before Sunrise and Before Sunset , is far removed from most of what passes in these goony movie days as youthful romance . 	It has the schmaltzy trappings of my romantic films , but Like Crazy allows its characters to express themselves beyond dialogue , crafting a true , intimate study .
russian ark A magnificent conjuring act , an eerie historical mirage evoked in a single sweeping wave of the hand by Alexander Sokurov . An enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside St.Petersburg 's Hermitage Museum . Sokurov 's work here is impressive and says something interesting about how nice it might be to go back in history to simpler times . Both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of Russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement . Should probably be re-titled Aleksandr and Sergei 's Excellent Adventure . A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . ... I 've never longed for expository dialogue so much in my life ... There is a genius to ( this ) experimental and utterly surreal historical epic that has nothing to do with the fact that it was shot in one uninterrupted , mind-boggling take ... The movie is a meditation on the love and envy that Russia has always felt toward Europe , and I wo n't pretend I got more than 30 percent of what was going on . [ Characterizes ] history as a large rush of information so huge , alive , and easy to get lost in that it would feel a shame if there existed nothing to give us a conduit to it . 	As successful as it is ambitious , Russian Ark condenses three centuries of Russian history into a single , uninterrupted , 87-minute take .
whats the worst that could happen The biggest misstep , though , is running the movie 's best sight gag into the ground . A mixed bag of hit-and-miss jokes . Well ... you could waste a few hours of your life . Does that answer the question ? Now and then sputters to comic life but more usually wheezes along . One of the funnier , well-acted comedies to come down the pike in a while . Rambling , contrived , not very funny . It recalls those ragged '60s caper pics that now seem to congest cable channels in which the leads frequently play second fiddle to nutty supporting players . Despite the potential for some fun retaliatory reciprocation between the two main characters , the film comes off as rather flat and uninspired , with only a few , occasional laughs breaking up what 's otherwise an unimaginative and monotonous exercise . Recycled humor that seems always aimed squarely at kids around 12 or so . If you like mediocre comedies , than this Olestra light fare is for you . 	Talented cast is squandered by an uninvolving script filled with unfunny gags .
platoon Platoon remains one of the best war films ever made and , quite arguably , the best ever about the war in Vietnam . This is movie-making with a zealot 's fervor . Possibly the best work of any kind about the Vietnam War since Michael Herr 's vigorous and hallucinatory book Dispatches . The movie is beautifully written ( by Stone ) , constructed with strong , clean lines , immaculately paced and regularly surprising . Oliver Stone has perhaps made the best movie that is specifically about Vietnam . Oliver Stone 's war classic is overlooked sometimes because of it 's brutal but long-winded potrayal of the duality of man . This however remains gripping stuff . A terrific film from a filmmaker long absent from his art , Platoon is a frightening and challenging look into the battlefield operations of Vietnam . Like no other movie could tell , Platoon shows us categorically that war -- and especially the Vietnam War -- is hell . Stone was able to portray the war so accurately because he himself had a tour of duty in Vietnam . No sane person should want to get any closer to war than this film . 	Informed by director Oliver Stone 's personal experiences in Vietnam , Platoon forgoes easy sermonizing in favor of a harrowing , ground-level view of war , bolstered by no-holds-barred performances from Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe .
jump tomorrow Endearingly wears its heart on its polyester sleeve . With its lollipop colors and the breezy la-la-la 's on the soundtrack , Jump Tomorrow is a charmingly kitschy trifle . Though the lackadaisical style becomes tiresome after a while , the film is ultimately held together by star-in- the-making Adebimpe . The performances are extremely good , and the tone maintains a droll continuity throughout . Fresh points of view and lovable characters make Jump Tomorrow more than just a formula romance . A sweet little oddity that ultimately leaves you -- and George -- with a smile . The story is fluff , but it 's mostly appealing . Rarely loses its unique charm along the way . Sweet-natured and goofy and funny in all the right places . In time , the film 's loopy ingenuousness becomes endearing . 	The light-hearted romantic comedy Jump Tomorrow charms with its whimsy and sweetness .
happy people a year in the taiga Herzog ... continues his streak of well-crafted documentaries with surprising subjects . Quirky and a little scary and rapturous all at the same time . Herzog has become a master of the understatement - knowing just how long the images can sustain you without a word being said . Too quietly uneventful for the big screen and burdened narrationally with Western-civilization pomposity on the purity of unencumbered subsistence life and the sacrosanctity of Nature . There is indeed much beauty on display , from the icy Taiga landscape to the age-old trapping techniques passed on through generations . Albeit a found film of sorts , Happy People is very much of a piece with Herzog 's other work , examining man 's place in the natural world , looking at man 's history and man 's ability to survive , to endure . Herzog is not insincere . His passion for outsize experience has always captured our essential human identity against big backdrops . He captures it again in `` Happy People , '' but this time with a twist . Cut down from a four-hour documentary by Vasyukov , the result is a film lacking in catastrophic tragedies of any sort that holds you nonetheless with its raw view of lives spurning quotidian modern comforts with a vengeance . A stirring meditation on the human spirit in extreme conditions , Happy People also reflects Herzog 's passion and fascination for the often unforgiving nature of the wild . Documentary on the life of hunters in Siberia is a welcome antidote for coddled city dwellers who need a reminder that humanity survived before Internet connections . 	Filled with breathtaking images of the foreboding Siberian countryside , Happy People : A Year in the Taiga is a fascinating look at an isolated society .
before night falls Manages to hold its center in a very strong performance by Javier Bardem . Although it 's sometimes slow-paced and mostly unassuming , Before Night Falls is the sort of movie that can change one 's view of the world . Oscar-nominated Javier Bardem gives one of the year 's best performances as Arenas . Before Night Falls is successful because of their skill at composing and portraying the film 's primary focus . It 's just a shame that Schnabel neglects to fill in the rest of the portrait . A valuable film because it tells a tale of Cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly do n't see that often in film . The film has some great imagery . An intriguing and sporadically powerful motion picture with a stellar central performance . Bardem 's performance is simply shattering . More a collection of half-formed images than any kind of a proper story . We are invited to let the film wash over us , but its disjointed amateurism prevents that from happening with much success . 	An impressionistic , fragmented look at Reinaldo Arenas , Before Night Falls ' imagery manages to evoke a sense of the writer 's artistry , and Bardem 's strong performance holds the film together . Finally , a biopic done well .
shaolin soccer A hoot from beginning to end . the stars of this film are the over-the-top stunts and kung fu action , which sublimely blend artfulness with silliness A very funny movie . We do n't recommend this for your 'Mother 's Day outing ' ... but it 's positively the best movie mixing kung fu and soccer ever . Chiau takes all of the wire-acrobatics and CGI gimmickry made ponderous by long-winded Matrix knockoffs and done the impossible . He 's made them fun again . Kung Fu and sports movies collide in writer/director/actor Stephen Chow 's devilishly entertaining Honk Kong action movie . None of this is meant to be taken seriously or even thought about . So just turn off your brain and enjoy the silliness . It is piffle , yes , but superior piffle . A hard chestnut to swallow . Awesome and fun ... 	The plot is utterly ridiculous , and the soccer in the movie is unlike any ever played anywhere on Earth , but watching Shaolin Soccer , you will probably find it impossible to care .
10010237-tokyo Some may consider it a callous critical evaluation . In truth , it 's nothing short of a luxuriant love letter . More of a curiosity than a cohesive sampling of cinematic visions , `` Tokyo ! '' fails to impress . My problem is that even though the three weird stories are intriguing and of interest in their own right , but when compiled as one film they seemed undeveloped . Tickles , repulses , and beguiles Uneven but worthwhile . The directors lay down strong stamps of personality in their choice of subjects and mise-en-scenes , while employing touches of fantasy that range from teasingly surreal to unsubtly grotesque . Perhaps it is inevitable as three foreign directors train their lenses on that unique island culture of the East that all three are propelled by fantasy or science fiction , and suggest more alienation from Tokyo than affection for the great city . Only Bong 's project transcends its limiting , carefully calibrated stylistic mode to achieve something substantive . To each , the metropolis is a dense atom ; its inhabitants , electrons crammed together but straining to avoid collision . The oddness is sort of refreshing . 	An imaginative , if uneven , love letter to a city that signals a great creative enterprise by its three contributing directors .
kung fu panda the kaboom of doom About as good as the first one . Not exactly Pixar , but it does the trick . By the end , Po experiences some of the same recycled epiphanies from the first film , sans their emotional panache . It drops points for a narrative that overstretches by at least 20 minutes . It 's a relief to report that Kung Fu Panda 2 is n't only superb , but matches the original picture in terms of scope and sentiment . Substituting action for charm , the sequel is a visual treat but not a sufficient comedic or narrative one , taking only modest advantage of Jack Black 's game voice work . Lacks the novelty of the original , which found a sweet spot in between martial arts and goofy animated critters , and milked it for every last laugh . This one feels like leftovers that have curdled . The original film was a compelling surprise , an unusually fun and sophisticated take on the wacky-animal CGI movie . The sequel remains visually beautiful and strikingly designed , but otherwise , it 's a surprise in all the wrong ways . Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson has done her best to ensure a child-friendly movie that parents can sit through too . This emotionally resonant , character-driven , action-packed sequel is awesome ! THERE 'S an old Chinese proverb ( that I just made up ) that goes : what is the point in making something pretty to look at if no one can see it ? 	The storyline arc may seem a tad familiar to fans of the original , but Kung Fu Panda 2 offers enough action , comedy , and visual sparkle to compensate .
post grad Post Grad is trying to reproduce the wackily dysfunctional manners of family life that made Little Miss Sunshine a hit , but has n't the charm , the jokes or , significantly , the nerve . Post Grad needs to go back to school . A sweet romantic comedy that would be better suited as a TV movie rather than big screen fare There 's certainly a lot of material there but none of the comedy works in any way at all and Keaton is a dead zone at the centre of the film . Post Grad is an annoying , tedious little film that touts a young woman 's desire to fulfill her dreams , at least until she drops them and everything else and runs across the country to follow a boy . Post Grad is like mashed potatoes without gravy , vanilla ice cream without syrup , seltzer without flavor . One bland , listless slog . While there 's little to hate , there 's almost nothing to like in a film this anodyne . The jokes are n't funny , the performances are middling and the storyline predictable . Post-Grad finds Alexis Bledel sinking into the quicksand of typecasting , playing nearly the same role she perfected during seven seasons as the ambitious Rory on Gilmore Girls . This lame family-centric comedy desperately wants to be Little Miss Sunshine but ends up - by virtue of the bizarre cast of unfunny characters - like Invasion of the Body Snatchers . 	A lightweight , unambitious comedy , Post Grad features fine actors that can do little with its middling , uninspiring script .
la confidential The script has the type of deft plotting that made films like The Crying Game and The Usual Suspects so popular . A riveting crime story about the shadowy side of city life where things are never what they seem . A solid , confident thriller . L.A . Confidential understands that men do n't always respond to evil with good and that the question of whom society regards as heroes is n't always a clear cut as it seems . Hanson cast two actors from Down Under , Crowe and Pearce , in the lead roles of Bud White and Ed Exley , respectively . This decision works wonders for the film ; if it had had big name stars in the lead , the viewer would most possibly be distracted by this . It is an intriguing whodunit , but nothing really unpredictable . Good work by Pierce and Crowe , though . Crooked cops . The mystery and allure of Hollywood in the '50s . Death , double-crossing , and secret alliances . Paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture . One of the best films of the year , an excellent film noir murder mystery brimming with style and atmosphere and topped off with fine acting . Rousing and superbly executed , with a climactic shootout that 's one of the most ingenious and jolting of its kind . L.A . Confidential is a rarity , a major Hollywood film with smart acting , dialogue and production values that actually works from beginning to end . 	Taut pacing , brilliantly dense writing and Oscar-worthy acting combine to produce a smart , popcorn-friendly thrill ride .
holy motors The best dream you 'll ever have without actually falling asleep . Just when you 're ready to throw up your hands and walk out , there 's a scene of Lavant gliding around Paris like some silent-movie character out of `` Judex '' or `` Fantomas '' ... In terms of pure cinematic sensation , Holy Motors stands as one of the most delightfully enigmatic movies that I 've seen in quite some time . I do n't know what Lavant is playing here because I 've never seen anything like it . An exhilarating , lunatic odyssey that delves deep into the murky relationship between film and our dreams . Carax 's piece is expansive , imaginative and intoxicated ( sometimes to the point of nausea ) with the seventh art . An out-of-the-box French sci-fi flick about role-playing , power , death , city life , dreams , limos , the virtual world , and anything else you want it to be about . It 's the coolest and strangest movie of the year , and once it gets its druglike hooks in your brain , you 'll never get them out again . Holy Motors quite literally takes us through the looking glass , but its most magical achievement is fooling us into forgiving and forgetting the fakery of it all . A film that not only demands repeat viewings but also makes that an attractive proposition . 	Mesmerizingly strange and willfully perverse , Holy Motors offers an unforgettable visual feast alongside a spellbinding -- albeit unapologetically challenging -- narrative .
mistress america [ A ] delectable comedy ... The heart of this thing is absent . An update on the wonderful screwball comedy tradition led by a dazzling performance by Gerwig . Like Brooke 's dream business , a caf/convenience store/hair salon , Mistress America is a mishmash of ideas Mistress America lacks the star power of last fall 's While We 're Young , but it has something more important - Greta Gerwig - and , largely for that reason , it 's the superior picture . A merry mashup of vintage Hollywood farce and terse social satire . Whatever Baumbach and Gerwig want to say about the inspirational charms of life 's colorful , flaky characters , they can find a way to say it without shouting . A pleasantly amusing whimsy that -- fueled by Baumbach 's rapid-fire dialogue and the charm of Gerwig and co-star Lola Kirke -- treads occasionally into laugh-out-loud hilarity Greta Gerwig 's ditzy typhoon socialite Brooke has to be one of the richest creations of writer-director Noah Baumbach 's career . `` Mistress America '' defies pigeonholing , which is true of anything produced by the insightful Baumbach , who always offers interesting observations about relationships and human frailties . 	Mistress America brings out the best in collaborators Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig , distilling its star 's charm and director 's dark wit into a ferociously funny co-written story .
reign of fire Credited writers Gregg Chabot , Kevin Peterka and Matt Greenberg took their dialogue from every action movie you 've seen , and characterizations do n't amount to a hill of dragon dung . I was disappointed with what I received ; a ( horrible ) dialogue driven , slight action movie with a few skimpy shots of dragons . A modern-day gothic horror ! This is one hot hot HOT movie , and it 's not just because of the cool dragons , it 's a fun ride ! Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty . Click to read review ... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . Reign of Fire may well be the most grim dragon movie ever made -- and it 's all the more effective for the filmmakers ' decision to play it straight . A howlingly badly written post-apocalyptic flamefest with high-camp violence and action . When you reach for as much as Reign of Fire reaches for - and you fail - you get a muddled mishmash that does n't satisfy on any level . Reign of Fire looks nice , and wiles away 90 minutes of screen time agreeably . 	An enjoyable B-movie if you do n't use your brain .
my date with drew My Date with Drew is just about the right length , and contains enough feel-good energy to make it a crowd-pleaser . Wonderfully showcases how the personal pursuit of a dream , no matter how silly or inconsequential it may seem to some , emboldens and fortifies the soul . It is all pretty harmless fly-on-the-wall fun , if a little too disposable . Silly yet wistfully romantic , the film is a real-life underdog 's tale that will appeal to both hopeless romantics and incurable optimists . essentially a well-assembled home movie Not only is that message loud and clear but the movie is also funny , exciting and awkward as we literally go through every emotion with the extremely self-conscious Herzlinger . Self-deprecating , genial humor punctuate docu about a guy trying to land a date with Drew Barrymore . It does work , and winningly so , as a sharp comedy powered by Brian Herzlinger 's disarming audacity and puckish self-deprecation . I found the concept contained zero appeal . Definitely one of those `` stand up and cheer for the little guy '' type of films , which probably has old Frank Capra grinning wherever the hell he is . 	A love-it-or-hate-it stalkerazzi documentary , My Date With Drew effectively draws on America 's celeb-obsessed pop culture so that viewers either unabashedly identify with it , or are filing restraining orders on Drew Barrymore 's behalf .
love is strange 2014 Gentle and naturalistic , Love Is Strange is an intimate portrait of devotion that you will root for , without falling in love . This is not a strident film ; it 's about subtle performances . An unforgettable portrait , set to a dazzling soundtrack of Chopin piano pieces , of the sense of loss we all feel when we are obliged to move into unfamiliar and uncomfortable surroundings . In this pointed and involving New York drama , the snap of realistic dialogue more than makes up for a fundamental flaw in the premise . Calling Love Is Strange a great gay love story is both precise and inaccurate ; I doubt I 'll see a more finely performed and beautifully crafted love story , with or without any mere modifiers , up on the big screen this year . Does n't have much of an exit plan , but it does n't really matter when the leads are this magnificently understated and real , making plot secondary when offered a chance to watch two exceptional actors dig into a special script . Sometimes gently funny , sometimes piercingly sad , ultimately uplifting . `` Love Is Strange '' is beautifully acted and bittersweet . It 's a gentle reminder that modern love , like a houseplant , needs sunlight , space and attention to grow . Written and directed by Ira Sachs , this is a non-action film of the kind that determinedly shuns any melodrama . All major events happen off screen while the focus is on the small everyday interactions that make up a life . This is a film of great gentleness and subtlety . 	Held aloft by remarkable performances from John Lithgow and Alfred Molina , Love Is Strange serves as a graceful tribute to the beauty of commitment in the face of adversity .
night moves 2013 Like the expressionistic power of the empty landscape in `` Meek 's Cutoff , '' its universe simultaneously feels real and nightmarishly abstract . It 's a very well made film . The film 's universe is one of complex moral fabric , where red herrings fall like flies and paranoia , among other things , is in the water . Ms. Reichardt does a stand-up job building suspense , with pockets of action here and there ... In its aim to tamp down Eisenberg 's neuroticism and have him offer slow drips of revelation rather than bursts of loquacious energy , Night Moves keeps too much hidden from view . An atmospheric but surprisingly thin procedural from the director of Old Joy and Meek 's Cutoff . Reichardt has crafted a mesmerising , unsettling film about the ripple effects of our decisions and how we live with them . The conclusion , like the rest of the film ... will be ticking around our heads for a while , and proved to be the perfect reminder that Reichardt is one of the most exciting directorial talents we have right now . Night Moves is a film of deliberate , gnawing intensity and focus , built around a Jesse Eisenberg performance that does n't give much away , at least not easily . Reichardt 's fifth feature is strongest in its set-up before becoming a tad perplexing and taking a baffling wrong turn at its inconclusive ending . 	A uniquely character-driven thriller with a finely composed cast and some outstanding direction from Kelly Reichardt , Night Moves bolsters its thought-provoking themes with compelling drama .
jcvd Put JCVD into the category of films that no one saw coming . ... as surprising a reconsideration of an action hero as one is likely to find . A real departure for Van Dame , but it ought to help his career . Who knew he could act ? No one will ever mistake these backstage shenanigans for Irma Vep . But as a self-regarding expression of masculine angst , it 's a Damme sight more fun than Synecdoche . Van Damme impressively takes the career comeback title from Mickey Rourke . It 's an acting tour de force not to be missed . Van Damme bears his soul . Unpredictable , engaging and even challenging , 'JCVD ' is an intriguing oddity . It 's as if he 's trying to reach through the screen and show us the real guy behind the image he 's spent a lifetime creating . I 'm not sure if he 's successful , but the attempt is fascinating . Van Damme delivers a devastating performance as a downtrodden caricature of himself , infusing the role with such emotional complexity that he seems at times almost unrecognizable . El Mechri really thinks he is making Citizen Kane in his non-linear deconstruction of a mythical man . He has n't , but it 's a heck of a curio . I sorta enjoyed myself . I could have done without the scene where he floats in anguished reverie , making Hamlet sound like an extrovert . 	JCVD is a touching , fascinating piece , with Jean-Claude Van Damme confounding all with his heartfelt performance .
zookeeper It proves useless and unfunny . Should 've been called Hey Kids , Watch A Pudgy Man Take Pratfalls And Act Like An Alpha A**hole-There 'll Be Talking Animals ! The odd chuckle aside , this is for the most part lots of lame slapstick and those trademark Kevin James pratfalls . A high concept-movie falls almost as flat as star Kevin James doing pratfalls . Zookeeper is exactly as loud and sloppy as you expected it to be , livened only occasionally by James and some of his co-stars mugging from inside the muck . I would rather lie on a bed of nails watching Dr Doolittle for a week than see a single reel of Zookeeper again . Failing to succeed as a rom-com or a kids ' flick , this feels surprisingly flat with the animals , and Kevin James , never really coming alive . I 'm not gon na sugarcoat this : Movies do n't have to be this bad . Lock the cage and throw away the key . 'Babe ' this is NOT . Sometimes a kid 's movie is just a kid 's movie . In the case of Zookeeper , it 's a place where young imaginations go to die . 	Zookeeper smothers Kevin James 's with a sodden script and a surfeit of jokes inappropriate for the young viewers who would be intrigued by its juvenile storyline .
10009083-land of the lost With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb , Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation , but he 's not doing anything fresh in Land of the Lost . Nothing at all besides two funnymen and one disposable , objectified woman running from place to place , screaming a bit , joking about bodily functions , and running around a bit more . Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall , Quantum Paleologist . Well , kinda . He 's really just Will Ferrell , Guy Who Wears Speedos No Matter What Movie He 's In . Land of the Lost sheds its TV-formula origins as a 1970s network series and becomes glib fun . In a summer of terrible blockbusters , Land of the Lost 's ability to distinguish itself as the worst of the bunch ( so far ) is almost commendable , given that its awfulness appears to have been achieved so effortlessly . Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything . Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything . What next : The Banana Splits movie ? Land of the Lost is , unfortunately , a perfect example of studio bloat : It 's all noise and flash and chaos , but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable . Like a valley of sedimentary rock , the film is comprised of layer upon crumbling layer of dumbness . As long as you enjoy the actors involved , Land of the Lost will mostly deliver . If you do n't , you 'll vanish into an entertainment void all your own . 	Only loosely based on the original TV series , Land of the Lost is decidedly less kid-friendly and feels more like a series of inconsistent sketches than a cohesive adventure comedy .
red cliff John Woo does n't make films , he makes movies -- and Red Cliff is one pretty darn good movie . Dripping with lush detail , spectacular battles , and superb acting performances , Red Cliff is a nuanced approach to combat rarely seen on screen in modern times ... a triumph [ that ] demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen . Woo does n't have Yimou 's natural feel for the courtly culture , or , perhaps , his sweeping way with this type of story . But his hand is sure and his eye , as ever , finds beauty in everything , even death . Like your chinese action ? The huge battles , physics defying fight sequences , the sense of history in the making ? Then you 'll love Red Cliff . The film 's shortcomings have less to do with Woo 's orchestration of his ambitious tale and more to do with the Frankenstein hatchet job enacted against it . Many people see Red Cliff as Hong Kong actioneer John Woo 's return to form . I 'm not one of them . John Woo has never once made a film I 've liked . Until now . It 's all about the action . Camp , over-the-top and entirely unbelievable : in short , the best thing John Woo has made in years . A formidable prelude to an epic battle with resplendent effects and action spectacles . 	Featuring some impressively grand battlefield action , John Woo returns to Asia and returns to form in the process for this lavish and slick historical epic .
shrek 2 Pretensions toward cohesion and character empathy are scuttled in favor of broad-barn gaggery . Visually accomplished and laden with humour , this provides more of the same kids-entertainment-cum-adult-friendly satire as the first film . With more of an epilogue than a sequel , Dreamworks manages to squeeze a few more drops of humor out of William Steig 's beloved ogre . It 's even more clever than the first Shrek , with even more advanced animation , and a larger cast that is equal to the original winning trinity of Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , and Cameron Diaz . The characters are still charming , the animation really is spectacularly smooth and expressive , and the Looney Tunes-style humor and pop-culture in-jokes are as inventive and hilarious as before . Loved the clever story ; hated the Broadway musical soundtrack . Shrek 2 is a Hollywood rarity : a sequel every bit as good -- if not better -- than the original . The real humor comes , once again from Murphy , whose Donkey is so genuinely funny and clever that he very nearly steals the film . Except that it 's stolen by Banderas as a rogue Puss In Boots outlaw hired by the King to do in Shrek . Every bit the equal of the first film . Bright , witty and very nearly without a dull patch , the rare followup that matches its predecessor . 	It may not be as fresh as the original , but topical humor and colorful secondary characters make Shrek 2 a winner in its own right .
gloria 2012 The movie revels in activity and vitality , promising that of course it 's possible for one to keep having fun no matter what age they are . At the same time , it 's under no illusions about the trepidation that comes with the twilight years . By the end , we dance with her , living in the moment as she does , not looking ahead to life 's next turn . To look into Garca 's face is to see the movie , a loving character study , in miniature at any moment : Gloria refuses to be your stereotype or a writer 's stock character . She 's complicated , like you ... A smart , incisive portrait of a woman who lives life on her own terms and does n't let herself get pushed around . Warm , wise , sophisticated and deeply human . Paulina Garca is a revelation . It 's the kind of film that will linger in your mind for weeks . The film is far from what we usually see . I overheard someone call it a `` midlife crisis drama . '' The comment was clueless for lots of reasons , most notably because there 's no crisis in Gloria at all , which is what makes it so marvelous . The movie lets you make up your own mind about this vivacious woman , who is doing her best not to surrender to her inner loneliness . Most films past the mid-life point either do n't acknowledge romance and sexuality , or make it the central point of the story ; the frank , comfortable , yet warmly erotic way Gloria deals with it is a breath of fresh air . The film grows in power-it 's unnerving and reassuring at the same time . 	Marvelously directed by Sebastian Lelio and beautifully led by a powerful performance from Paulina Garcia , Gloria takes an honest , sweetly poignant look at a type of character that 's all too often neglected in Hollywood .
primary colors The book was explicit in its indictment of Clinton ( or his clone or whatever ) , but the movie , while keeping most of the storyline the same and many of the scenes literally verbatim , still manages to tiptoe around the issue of personal responsibility . It used to be that we had to wait 20 years for the fictionalization of history -- now that gap seems to have closed to less than five years . Kinda sad . But also kinda entertaining ! There are piecemeal wonders in Primary Colors , but not the grand and resonant vision the film should have been . Like its politicians , the movie is savvy about using whatever it takes to achieve a goal . As is often the case in a Mike Nichols film , even the smallest roles are beautifully cast and performed , and production values are top-of-the-line . The film seldom displays much in the way of directorial hallmarks . Striking an excellent balance between wry cultural critique and crisp entertainment value , the picture is as smart and funny as any comedy-drama in recent memory . Maintains a fairly deft sense of irony and emotional resourcefulness with regard to its subject , which is , most broadly , the complicated interrelations among politics , sex , ethics and the press . Adapting Joe Klein 's roman a clef of the same name , ferociously witty screenwriter Elaine May and her smooth old compatriot in comedy , director Mike Nichols , have made a zingy drama and have staffed it well . A slack , tepid picture stuck in a no man 's land between satire and drama . 	Well acted and suprisingly funny .
gett the trial of viviane amsalem Almost all of the film takes place inside a courtroom , at irregular intervals over five years , but there is no sense of drag or slump ; on the contrary , the action quivers with tension , impatience , comic heat , and , beneath it all , an irrepressible rage . Gripping cinema from start to finish , almost implausibly so . [ Ronit Elkabetz ] brilliantly captures Viviane 's mounting frustration and the sense of release in those moments when she just does n't care anymore . Siblings Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz bring their blistering trilogy of male domination in an Israeli family to a rewarding close with Gett , the Trial of Viviane Amsalem . Though there is no action , there is vibrancy to the dialog that enthralls for the duration of the film . Forcefully crystallizes juxtaposition of hypocrisy , cynicism , frustration and absurdity when a woman is forced to abide ancient rules . . . caught in colorful and funny tales . `` GETT '' shows that sexism is not an aberration , but baked in by design into some of our deepest institutions , and fighting it is a long journey down a hard road . The movie appeals to an unreal world , that would easily make the viewer believe it is a real chronicle of a real trial . [ full review in Spanish ] The kind of tragic and absurd blend that can only be labeled as Kafkaesque . A highly compressed , exquisitely acted tale of two people who do not belong together plays out as a courtroom saga that , in story terms , runs longer than many marriages . 	On paper , GETT : The Trial of Viviane Amsalem might seem less than thrilling , but on the screen , it delivers two hours of nonstop , tightly wound , brilliantly acted drama .
ikiru Ikiru is a thoughtful and truly well-made film , wherein Kurosawa has the opportunity to explore the human condition more fully than in his action-packed adventures Talk about a movie that earns its tears . I think this is one of the few movies that might actually be able to inspire someone to lead their life a little differently . Deeply moving . A heartbreaking masterwork from Kurosawa with nary a samurai in sight . Meticulously constructed , beautifully played and poignant . If you have never seen it , you should . If you have seen it before , your admiration will only increase . May not be the first movie you think of when ticking off the list of Kurosawa 's best films , but it is the one that stands defiantly as his deepest , best acted and most watchable . Simultaneously an intensely human story , a timeless snapshot of postwar Japan , and a scathing satire of the bureaucratic mind-set . Often heavy-handed but never less than heartfelt , Ikiru ( To Live ) is universal in its thrust and startlingly astute in its narrative engineering . 	Ikiru is a well-acted and deeply moving humanist tale about a man facing his own mortality , one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa 's most intimate films .
dominion prequel to the exorcist `` Dominion '' is n't outright horror , and a welcome relief from the days where shots are shorter than the hairs on our heads . Schrader 's film is a notch better than Harlin 's ( it 's elegantly framed , and stately where the other one was music-video pushy ) , but when you boil out the demon feathers ... it 's the same damn movie . At least it 's better than some of the earlier Exorcist sequels . After 32 years , two sequels , and two prequels , The Exorcist remains an impossible act to follow . There 's no escaping that Dominion is finally an act of commercial scavenging . It actually might have been considered pretty good had it been made 30 years ago , when people might have cared about the backstory of Father Merrin . You want ... a misunderstood masterpiece , but it 's really just a mess , albeit one whose unique place in film history virtually assures it its own ... Trivial Pursuit question . Ambitious , serious-minded horror opus . The austere , cerebral 'Dominion ' is a serious and ambitious alternative to Harlin 's movie , but it 's only marginally superior to it . Schrader has done a remarkable job of building up to 'The Exorcist ' , as if 1973 really is in the future . 	While director Schrader 's attempt at a literate , internal exposition on evil temptations and human sin is admirable , this prequel suffers from hit-and-miss psychological tension , poor visual effects , and weak writing -- an overambitious failure of a horror movie .
blow out A well-crafted Hitchcockian-style thriller with De Palma again in top form . It 's a mystery why this fizzled at the box office in the summer of 1981 . Travolta shows he has a sense of suspense . In the amazingly hyperbolic finale , DePalma conflates patriotism , dirty tricks , violence against women , and slasher movies into a single sick joke . There are some neat performances , particularly Travolta 's convincing bid to be taken seriously after years of being dismissed as frivolous beefcake . If cynicism were a superhero franchise , Blow Out would be its origin story . Of all De Palma 's movies , Blow Out is the one I most like to see over and over . Brian DePalma 's masterpiece , a wonderful movie . A forgotten gem . A movie which continues [ De Palma ] practice of making cross-references to other movies , other directors , and actual historical events , and which nevertheless is his best and most original work . Perfectly contrasts movies that reveal the truth against those which avoid it - a blood-drenched yet stake-free slasher vs. the far more insidious horrors of all-American living . 	With a story inspired by Antonioni 's Blow Up and a style informed by the high-gloss suspense of Hitchcock , DePalma 's Blow Out is raw , politically informed , and littered with film references .
star trek iv the voyage home One of the most purely enjoyable of the Star Trek films . The Voyage Home is n't as dramatically powerful as the two previous Trek films , but it gives the characters plenty of time to show off their lighter sides . Best of Trek This is easily the most absurd of the Star Trek stories -- and yet , oddly enough , it is also the best , the funniest and the most enjoyable in simple human terms . Allows the characters and relationships shine , but whales ? An effective and enjoyable sample of entertainment -- not good science fiction , but a lightweight piece of comic fantasy utilizing characters so familiar that they feel like old friends . By far the silliest and most self-mocking of the series . the bad guys ... are really my countrymen so ... still great though The eco-themes are writ large , but are saved from smacking of cringe-worthy earnestness by the good humour of the whole endeavour . The most successful and widely appealing of the Star Trek films , The Voyage Home is also the most idiosyncratic some of the most humorous and humane moments in the Trek canon . 	Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home is perhaps the lightest and most purely enjoyable entry of the long-running series , emphasizing the eccentricities of the Enterprise 's crew .
letters from iwo jima Finally finishes a thematic trilogy begun with Unforgiven and A Perfect World . Letters does something else , something devastating and timely as the U.S. faces loss in the Middle East . It interrogates the inevitability of loss in war , even when victory is proclaimed , and the senselessness of the effort . Eastwood is a master of the extended look ( this comes from the two directors he acknowledges as his own masters , Sergio Leone and Don Siegel ) , the look that stretches time and that is blinded by what it sees . Eastwood has crafted the best war movie since `` Saving Private Ryan . '' ... takes two tried and true Hollywood elements - Clint Eastwood and the World War II picture - and turns them Japanese . a stark masterpiece , rife with irony , pathos , and melancholy for the waste of it all . one to see whether it gets an Oscar nomination or not . Eastwood 's direction is a thing of beauty , blending unblinking ferocity with fragile delicacy . Humanizing our old adversaries does n't erase their war crimes , and Eastwood does n't whitewash the brutality of Japanese militarism . His point is that the Emperor 's infantrymen were as much the victims of the Japanese war machine as the GIs they fought . Clint Eastwood 's revisionism painting America in a bad light and turning Imperial Japan 's barbaric soldiers into boon chaps wo n't change the facts . 	A powerfully humanistic portrayal of the perils of war , this companion piece to Flags of our Fathers is potent and thought-provoking , and it demonstrates Clint Eastwood 's maturity as a director .
women in trouble Guys may remember this film as the finest collection of ladies who almost take it all off ever assembled . But in-between all the underwear and fetish outfits is a rather amusing collection of stories described by its very title . A lucky alchemy of writer and cast turns what could have been an indie bore into something surprisingly uproarious . Mr. Gutierrez , as suggested by all the dcolletage , appears to be a breast man . Too bad he did n't set his sights higher . Women in Trouble awkwardly mixes blue material with sob stories . Gutierrez 's script ca n't supply female characters as believable as Almodovar 's , but in the director 's chair he gives his cast room to compensate with funny , self-aware performances . The most jeopardy these women confronted was the day they said yes to Women in Trouble . Unfortunately , while it is a great idea for a sketch , or a web series , it 's not a movie length idea . It 's not pornography , but it evokes that same uneasy feeling that you 're watching something that 's so wrong but so right at the same time . This exuberantly uninhibited indie has the anything-goes spirit of something tossed off in a single burst of collaborative energy . Apparently , in Gutierrez 's mind , expanding the range of humanity available to women on film means they can be porn stars or prostitutes ... and they can be catastrophically dumb ... 	Sebastian Gutierrez certainly has an eye for the beauty of the female form , but Women in Trouble lacks a compelling script or point of view to go with its curvaceous visual appeal .
the wonders 2015 The coming-of-age of a young girl in Italy as a hard worker and a resilient person . Superb star turn from Maria Alexandra Lungi but this does n't grip as it might . Most of all , it 's a film that knows the value of its appealing young stars and that makes their credible and entertaining antics its focus , winning you over with the squeals and strops of these tiny worker bees . Aiming to capture a young teen 's sense of belonging in a family determined to steer its own course , the pic has intermittent rewards yet is n't weighty enough . It 's rare that a movie loses me in the final moments but still captures my heart . The Wonders is one such wonder . Like a rural Fellini , Rohrwacher mixes the mundane with the absurd to create a sometimes fabulous tale that always feels palpably real . Without any of the self-importance , maudlin sentimentality or winking reflexivity that characterises most coming-of-age tales , Alice Rohrwacher 's second feature is a patient argument for , and quiet toast to , a rapidly disappearing way of life . The drama is a bit episodic , but the performances are nuanced , and there 's a lot of incisive observation about family dynamics , as well as bonus tips on beekeeping . The episodic storytelling style can seem haphazard but the writer-director Alice Rohrwacher succeeds wonderfully well in capturing the richness of the kids ' lives in their own remote and often brutal world . Alice Rohrwacher 's ineffably lovely second feature [ is ] a coming-of-age story that conjures an effortless naturalism . 	The Wonders offers a charming coming-of-age tale that doubles as a quietly effective tribute to a vanishing way of life .
knights tale A wonderful mix of Lady Hawke and Labyrinth . ... surprisingly intelligent summer fare ... Gadzooks ! Methinks I witnessed the World Series of Jousting in A Knight 's Tale and actually enjoyed every minute of it . Ledger carries A Knight 's Tale as far as it can go , which is an accomplishment . The movie promises to rock you , and much of the time it does . The overindulgent jousting matches and the 'good guy vs. bad guy ' scenario becomes overbearing and a bit repetitive . Still , it 's worth a look-see just to see Ledger and Sossamon steam up the screen . ... this is the kind of movie that has no interest whatsoever in at least operating inside respectable boundaries . The material is delivered with such youthful exuberance that it 's difficult to dismiss it outright . What a great idea to plunder the history books ( and Renaissance airs ) and single out a now-defunct sport like jousting . A dumb summer movie done with smarts . 	Once you get past the anachronism , A Knight 's Tale becomes a predictable , if spirited , Rocky on horseback .
xmen Few characters get much opportunity to hold our attention . It is quite entertaining , but it is simply too short . The best news is that you do n't even have to know what a Marvel Comic is to enjoy X-Men . A recipe for the perfect summer flick . The film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition , character development , and special effects-enhanced action . This is what a summer blockbuster should look like -- smart , sexy , tight in all the right places . While it 's not perfect , it is unique : a big-budget comic-book movie populated by superheroes who have very uneasy relationships with Truth , Justice and the American Way . As overwrought , over-buzzed , F/X-driven , pure-popcorn summer escapist flicks go , X-Men delivers the goods better than most . ... done with such remarkable visual style , you might not notice its want of substance . What makes this film such a success is its seriousness on the subject of proper and improper responses to oppression , its unique and memorable characters , its cleverness and visual imagination , and its refusal to degenerate into a bloodbath . 	Faithful to the comics and filled with action , X-Men brings a crowded slate of classic Marvel characters to the screen with a talented ensemble cast and surprisingly sharp narrative focus .
hotel for dogs A laughless , gadget-geared and poop-obsessed kid comedy based on a Lois Duncan book , it will sorely test any parent hoping to have a few laughs with the kids and make it home without a side trip to the Humane Society . In the department of small mercies , the dogs do n't talk , but the human dialogue is as stale as the characters bathing in love-the-family-you're-with pathos . It needs something quite special to save this film from toxic splurges of sentiment . Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon duly oblige as a pair of fabulously awful foster parents . A fetching and funny family film with special appeal to dog lovers . Everyone needs love and a home , whether kids or animals , is the cheesy but entirely heartfelt message of this fairly predictable and old-fashioned kids ' movie . Marking its territory in the mind-boggling middle ground between Schindler 's List and Beverly Hills Chihuahua , the cartoonish kid pic Hotel for Dogs turns out to be a weirdly oblivious Holocaust parable . Dog people will like it . Look , I love dogs . But this film tried my patience almost beyond endurance . Corny and silly ... with a brisk pace and lively soundtrack . Whilst not as funny as it could have been , Hotel For Dogs gets by on sheer charm , thanks to a likeable cast , a decent script , pacey direction and a high cuteness factor . 	Hotel for Dogs may appeal to children and dog lovers , but it 's ultimately contrived , predictable , and simplistic .
chasing amy It 's too loud , sometimes , and it 's always pushy , but it 's got heart . Not everything worked or made sense , but the characters and their problems seemed real . Funny , romantic , and a bit challenging . Lacks insight and finesse , and feels like a boldfaced Rorschach for Smith 's own hang-ups . For all its false steps and the occasional dubious philosophical stance , it 's an exhilarating movie . tackles issues and explores situations that many other filmmakers have shied away from The story is a refreshing twist on the standard romantic comedy , but something about Kevin Smith 's style leaves me feeling a little dirty . Kevin Smith seems to be spilling his guts in this movie . Slowly , like a latent teen pulled against his will into adulthood , Kevin Smith is growing up . But he 's not growing quietly . Smith 's most provocative outing yet and certainly the toughest to forget . 	Chasing Amy explores gender roles , sexual mores , and the limits of friendship with a mixture of sensitivity , raw honesty , and director/screenwriter Kevin Smith 's signature raunchy humor .
apollo 18 The documentary look and feel of the movie is impressive until it is overcome by the inaneness of the plot For most horror fans it will be kind of a snooze . Make no mistake , Apollo 18 is a *terrible* movie . In space no one can hear you yawn . So utterly broken at a conceptual level that a truly good film was completely out of the question . Has no thrills , no chills , no scares and contains a villain , or several of them , actually , that will turn you to stone -- from boredom . Suffice it to say that the suspense works , and the obligatory sequel hook genuinely intrigues us with its possibilities rather than merely threatening a retread . It goes to such painstaking lengths for stylistic plausibility that the end product is actually quite dull , squandering its novel 'Paranormal Activity in space ' concept as a result . The source of the creepy events , when it 's finally revealed , is profoundly dull , like a forgettable episode of The X-Files or Fringe . [ A ] zero-intensity space bore . 	A boring , suspense-free Paranormal Activity rip-off that feels long even at just 90 minutes .
back to the future Part II was better , but that 's just me . The first one is a fun romp too . Just sign on for the trip . Back to the Future offers the summer 's most dazzling joyride . Robert Zemeckis 's direction , like the technical contributions , is first-rate , and after an ambling start takes off into frenetic , non-stop fun . Mr. Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far . He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny , whimsical tall tales for a long time to come . One of the best of the 1980s comedies . A career highlight for Michael J . Fox . Probably the most carefully-scripted blockbuster in Hollywood history . infectiously silly and fun time-travel comedy . Lloyd and Fox are a great team . `` Future '' fandom resonates in the public imagination because it marries innocence with high-concept fun . A masterpiece ! This irresistible combination of dazzling effects and sly comedy propelled Michael J Fox to stardom and Robert Zemeckis to the front rank of Hollywood directors . 	Inventive , funny , and breathlessly constructed , Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit .
1213999-brothers Brothers is n't your standard PTSD yarn . Brothers is a heartbreaking film that speaks to the lifelong aftershocks of war , and to the powerful bonds of family and of love . Deft acting -- hello Tobey Maguire , Jake Gyllenhaal , Natalie Portman -- saves the flick from wallowing too deeply into melodrama . A sudsy remake that soft-soaps its tougher inspiration . The A-list stars go for it , but are 10 years off doing the story justice . This intense story of family conflict is powerful and gripping , an absolutely mesmerizing motion picture experience . Sheridan takes a routine story and presents it with clenching seriousness , making it not only boring , but unpleasant . [ Sheridan ] aims for Greek tragedy but ends up with a PTSD melodrama . In a role without any flamboyant touches , playing what is essentially just a decent , intelligent woman , Portman lends the film dignity , understanding and true radiance . This is a corny tale , told with both generous helpings of deli-sliced cheese and a brief stretch of chilling tumultuousness . The fine interplay between the three leads builds to a gripping , emotionally devastating finale that offers no easy answers while still arriving at a poignant and satisfying conclusion . 	It plays more like a traditional melodrama than the Susanne Bier film that inspired it , but Jim Sheridan 's Brothers benefits from rock-solid performances by its three leads .
muppets from space Teletubbies may come and go , but Muppets are forever . Let me make things clear : I still like the Muppets , but an increase in quality is in serious need . Witty , warm-hearted ! Smart and winning , this sixth Muppet feature film comes closest to recapturing the pure joy of the 1979 original ! This new Muppet movie is the funniest I can remember ! Be pleasantly surprised by a silly romp that may be just as fun for the younger set as it is for anyone with a nostalgic craving for the antics of the sophisticated puppets . Does n't have the right awe and wonder ! The Muppets are on their best behavior here , meaning that they basically drive everyone around them nuts . Thin in its ideas and surprises . A wild and funny tale . 	If Muppets from Space lacks the magic and wit of its cinematic predecessors , this pleasingly silly space romp is funny and clever enough to make for better-than-average family entertainment .
a very long engagement 2004 The quest format keeps the story moving briskly , and Jeunet provides numerous pleasures , particularly visual , along the way . There are some movie couples that just look like they belong together - Mathilde and Manech are one such couple . They are both extraordinarily beautiful . I enjoyed the film immensely , but felt it could have been one of 2004 's best if 15 or so minutes had been carefully cobbled out of it . Right up to its haunting final scene , A Very Long Engagement will alternately shake you up and soothe you . And that 's a very good combination . ... [ Jean-Pierre Jeunet ] revient la charge avec toujours autant d'inspiration et nous invite passer un trs beau dimanche de fianailles . All in all , Jeunet makes a pretty case for the idea that life is ruled by chaos and chance , but made meaningful and worthwhile by love . ... soaked in Jeunet 's peculiar , oily sense of cinema . While it is a slower burning film than some of his others it casts a lovely light . Fits together almost too perfectly , but you 'll be able to forgive that . It 's a wonderful film that is absolutely beautiful . Cheers to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel ! Engagement is a powerful and vivid motion picture , but rarely , if ever , does it capture the heart . one very imaginative boring movie 	A well-crafted and visually arresting drama with a touch of whimsy .
max manus man of war A conventional biopic lacking in passion but of great importance toward understanding the Norwegian resistance to Nazi occupation . An epic by Scandinavian standards , Manus 's period re-creation is lavish-but the too-polished rental dcor does n't create a living past . A fascinating , well-acted glimpse into a little known theatre of the war . A good old-fashioned war movie - a tale of courage and honour based on fact . Basically a slice of formulaic Hollywood-style mythmaking , writ large and woefully empty . Impressively directed , frequently exciting and powerfully emotional war thriller with a strong script and great performances . A taut , captivating , well-acted and thrilling war film . The destruction in Max Manus is elaborately staged by co-directors Espen Sandberg and Joachim Roenning ... It 's a cracking yarn rippingly told . If it 's havoc you want wreaked on Hitler 's goosestepping invaders , then take it to the Max . The film exhibits another flaw common to film biographies : Directors Espen Sandberg and Joachim Roenning seem more interested in making a shrine to ( as opposed to a biography of ) their war hero . 	This good old-fashioned Norwegian WW2 film has impressive set pieces and never suffers for a lack of suspense .
1087270-mummy Check your brain at the door , and enjoy the bumpy ride , cause this one will have you laughing , screaming and sighing your way into the mysterious world of ancient Egypt and its spooky-dooky myths . Jump back , monster-mashers ; The Mummy mambos ! One of the more confused productions in recent cinematic history ! An adventure-flick wannabe ! O roteiro de Stephen Sommers tem o bom-senso de no se levar a srio . The Mummy fails to reconcile image and tone ! George Lucas and Steven Spielberg pioneered this new-yet-old approach in the 'Star Wars ' and 'Indiana Jones ' series , and the formula is viable enough to make 'The Mummy ' popular with its target teenage audience . One more overblown exercise in big budget lameness ! Tries to have it both ways , sending up the adventure genre for laughs while also going for some mild shocks , but the sand slips through its fingers on both counts . Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz just do n't have what it takes to carry the picture . 	It 's difficult to make a persuasive argument for The Mummy as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement , but it 's undeniably fun to watch .
make it happen We know the trajectory , it 's a question of how brightly the rocket burns and how interested we are in the astronauts aboard this dance missile from small town Indiana to Chicago Big Time Dance School The directing 's lazy , the love interest is a smarmy douche and the dialogue is flatter than Winstead 's toned tummy . It 's all just filler between the dance scenes , which are admittedly fun . Think Pussycat Dolls with slightly more clothes on . Unrepentantly formulaic , but enjoyable all the same . In short , this is a watchable dance movie and Winstead 's performance just about compensates for the generally poor direction . Mary Elizabeth Winstead [ has ] star quality . It could be a contemporary take on classic backstage musicals . Or it could be the end of the cinematic arts as we know them . This awesomely unambitious film has all the depth of a Pepsi ad . There 's dancing , there 's emotion , there 's an earnestly cheesy inspirational storyline , there 's nothing you wo n't have seen before . Then you wait for the moment one of the regular girls gets injured , the hostess has to find a replacement and ... the rest you know . Despite boundless energy and some surprisingly artful photography , 'Make it Happen ' is never more than product . Cheap , abysmally scripted and utterly soulless . 	Cheap , predictable , formulaic and unimaginative generic dance film . Comes across as Showgirls for simpleton teens , but with much less flesh on show .
italian job Director F. Gary Gray delivers a thoroughly enjoyable movie with engaging characters and fast-paced action sequences involving almost every form of transportation possible . Energetic and lean , beautifully shot and well-acted , `` The Italian Job '' is a caper whose hip style is generated almost entirely from within . It does exactly what we expect it to do very well , charming us with style , wit , and the simple boldness of real-life car chases . Peter Collinson 's The Italian Job ( 1969 ) is not a great film -- it 's an average film with a great finale . Oh , and another thing : F Gary Gray 's remake blows the bloody doors off it . A remarkably average heist flick that 's entertaining , but completely devoid of surprises and major thrills . Cette production estivale est divertissante l'espace d'un instant si l'on ne cherche pas en trouver les moindres dfauts . Unlike the original , this Mini adventure lacks a single defining moment . But , as Michael Caine remakes go , it 's way better than Get Carter . When an armored truck vanishes on Hollywood Boulevard , it 's a nifty metaphor for the way this relatively unheralded flick is likely to steal millions in box-office gold from under the noses of such glamorous competitors as 'X2 ' and 'Matrix ' ... Heist movies seem pretty quaint and analog in our era where high stakes crime is primarily electronic in nature . But until someone can make embezzlement cinematically interesting , we 're left with theft and this movie just gets away with it . Despite leaving out the charm and cheekiness of the earlier film , this is an efficient and enjoyable romp . 	Despite some iffy plot elements , The Italian Job succeeds in delivering an entertaining modern take on the original 1969 heist film , thanks to a charismatic cast .
1032176-goodfellas Martin Scorsese 's soberest , most vivaciously thrilling vision of how hollow ( and short ) the fast lives of mafios really are . Definitive , sky-high Scorsese , and the one towards which all his subsequent films have been reaching , Goodfellas is , put bluntly , the best movie of the director 's career . One of the most perfect movies ever made . Goodfellas is the movie that sees most directly into the heart of the mob . Long and brutal , but Scorsese was never better at marshalling his cinematic tools to tell a story ... his definitive statement about the New York City mob . No finer film has ever been made about organized crime . The most profoundly Catholic of contemporary filmmakers , Scorsese has here imagined a world without the slightest notion of sin-everything is permitted , and he is both fascinated and appalled by the total freedom of his characters . GoodFellas is an appalling masterpiece of the kind that , along with New York 's current well-publicized troubles , is likely to give pause to anyone planning to make a trip to the city . Scorsese brilliantly juxtaposes scenes of family greatness with those of bleak criminal action . The performances are superb examples of action , delivery , and nuance . Be prepared to be completely bowled over by a director at the peak of his talents and in full control of top-notch material . 	Hard-hitting and stylish , GoodFellas is a gangster classic -- and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese 's career .
1083484-blade Sultry , silly story ! Blade is one of those all-style , no-substance goth-mix adaptations that looks like The Crow , sounds like Spawn , and feels like Dark City . If vampire pictures are your cup of tea , this is one of the better ones . Ideal summer fare : quite enjoyable , and equally disposable . By the second half , it 's dragging despite all the action . The acting is overblown , the special effects are impressive , and the violence is loud and often . Just like in a comic strip . A pleasant enough popcorn movie that may not break any new ground , but has a fun time right where it is . Snipes plays his superhero character with such aching coolness that you ca n't wait for the next dumb-ass vampire to get in his way . A very welcome surprise . Takes itself far too seriously for its own good . 	Though some may find the plot a bit lacking , Blade 's action is fierce , plentiful , and appropriately stylish for a comic book adaptation .
up for grabs This smartly assembled comedy articulates irritation with and bewilderment at its subject : the legal battle for possession of a baseball . A mockumentary with real people . With complex lead characters , an endless supporting cast and focus on an inanimate object that draws out the weakness in men , the movie has more in common with the Lord of the Rings trilogies than anything from the camera of Ken Burns . Sometimes the most fascinating stories come from the most trivial of places , and this lesson is perpetually evident throughout the addictively entertaining Up For Grabs The tone is best captured by one Bay Area sportswriter 's wry comment that catching a valuable home run ball is 'sort of like winning the lottery except you feel like you earned it . ' Michael Wranovics wove a thrilling story out of the matchup with deft research , glowing humanity and inert humor . A winning combination of humor and crafty filmmaking that cleverly masks the social commentary going on beneath . The longer the case drags on , the more you may begin to wish that , somehow , both sides lose . It 's a terrific story -- part mystery , part farce , part legal nail-biter -- with a last-minute reversal so bitterly ironic it could have been scripted by Billy Wilder . It would be hard to find a more succinct and entertaining indictment of American popular culture and obsessive sports fans . 	You do n't have to be a baseball fan to be entertained by the absurdities , obsessions , and greed on display in this documentary .
sunshine state Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . ... Sayles repeats his formula in a faded Florida beach town with distinctly lesser returns Sayles ' writing is so good , and so convincing , he makes the experience more like reading a complex and well-researched novel than watching a movie . ... as good as all the performances are , they just ca n't make up for the fact that it 's just too darn long . Edie Falco sparkles as a mermaid on dry land Sayles ' pace is leisurely , but the characters and story keep us engrossed . A distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough . This well acted ensemble melodrama is not one of John Sayles ' strongest films . [ Sayles ] so desperately wants to tell when all he needs to do is show . 	Wonderfully acted , but the story and pacing can use a little work .
deliver us from evil Exceptional ... the effect is shattering . The church declined to comment to Berg . Her film speaks volumes about its silence -- and about a wrong that can never be righted . A literally stunning documentary . This superb documentary about the Catholic Church 's worst pedophile scandal is in many ways far scarier than any fiction . The great tragedy underlying the story of Father O'Grady is how many children might not have been victims , had Cardinal Roger Mahoney ... been more interested in protecting the children residing in his diocese rather than furthering his own ascendancy wit The film is painful viewing , in large part because director Amy Berg relates the facts and depicts the victims and the culprits with detached gravity . Berg 's intuitively right ratio of personal and analytical material , her implied belief in transcendence of horrific demoralization , shows a truly progressive vision . The movie is a litany of victims and a chilling indictment . The Da Vinci Code 's basically The Sound of Music compared to this . You come out of the film shaking your head in disbelief at Father Oliver O'Grady , but fully enraged at Cardinal Rogery Mahony . 	Deliver Us From Evil is a superb documentary and a searing look at an institution protecting its leaders at the expense of its followers . A profoundly disturbing chronicle of a wolf in sheep 's clothing , the film builds a clear-eyed case against pedophile priest Oliver O'Grady , and the Catholic bureaucracy that protected him . The recollections of O'Grady 's victims are nothing short of shocking and heartbreaking .
1197696-fantastic mr fox This slender story is told with droll wit , clever staging and doll house charm thanks to Fox 's use of old-fashioned , stop-motion animation . Though Anderson 's trademark deadpan banter and clever silliness are in full force , the script is no less sophisticated than anything out of the filmmaker 's catalogue . ... an animation masterpiece from one of America 's finest filmmakers . It 's also a fairly entertaining children 's story . But for kids ? Let 's say it 's a film for Wes Anderson . Fantastic Mr Fox resembles a high-budget update of British children 's programmes from the '60s and '70s like Pogles ' Wood and Bagpuss . Home-made and hand-made , all arts and crafts ; peculiarly English , in other words . There is little or nothing here for young children and some may be frightened . All the better for us big kids who can appreciate wit and artisanship . An alluring and curious hybrid of Roald Dahl 's rich and dark storytelling and Wes Anderson 's eccentric and erratic film mind . Fantastic is n't a strong enough word for this vibrant , intelligent , hilarious film for all ages A creepy cartoon filled with inappropriate inside jokes that are mostly over the head of the desired tyke demographic , exactly what one would you expect of a claymation vehicle crafted by the cerebral Wes Anderson . Although there are parts of this film that are highly entertaining and scenes that are very amusing , I was not totally enamored with `` Fantastic Mr. Fox '' . 	Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully funny feast for the eyes with multi-generational appeal -- and it shows Wes Anderson has a knack for animation .
down in the valley a major flaw almost ruins some of the best acting of any film this year ... Only a disastrous lurch by the script can make us stop caring , but that 's what happens : Drama is replaced by melodrama . All the problems in this film could have been solved really quickly if anybody had used a little bit of intelligence . Disturbing but riveting ... The movie turns into something strange and annoying , an attempted blend of a suburban thriller with an Old West shoot-'em-up . Thirty minutes shorter , this would be a swell romantic chiller . As it stands , the film collapses under the weight of cowboy mythologies drawn out to unsustainable lengths . A wonderful throwback to 70s era filmmaking ... Norton reminds us that he 's a serious contender for the title of our greatest modern actor . Strange but compelling . It 's possible that we 're in the early stages of the latest cinematic fad -- the revisionist Western -- but with its crippling second half , this one ultimately turns out to be a brokeback movie . The values of past and present collide in this beautifully shot , finely acted reexamination of the American Dream . 	The premise of Old West clashing with modern suburbia is fresh and initially intriguing , but the second act degenerates into a clumsy jumble of events which strain credibility .
henrys crime 2010 ... despite some minor grumbles , I was entertained by Henry 's Crime . Really entertaining and a lot of fun . Henry 's Crime is neither enthralling enough as a heist movie , nor amusing enough as a comedy , making it rather less than the sum of its parts . Reeves seems more laid-back than loser - it 's hard to accept him as someone who has let half of his adult life go to waste without minding , or even noticing . The film 's ungainly mix of heist , romance and backstage comedy never jells . The screenplay leeches all the fun out of it , and the principals - aside from Caan , who generates his own power - seem lost and abandoned . Even as far as low-budget independent films about Buffalo , N.Y. , toll booth operators go , `` Henry 's Crime '' is an odd bird . If you had to compare it to a Russian classic , Malcolm Venville 's mild comedy about a nobody ( Keanu Reeves ) who gets busted for a crime he did n't commit might suggest half-baked Dostoevsky or lightweight Gogol . But not Chekhov . Chekhov does small town USA in this zany , simmering slo-mo character driven retro-crime caper that plays out as a detour to an incidental bank heist , on the way to a softball game . Caan and Keanu are a strangely intoxicating match made in Buffalo . An intermittently entertaining comedy/drama with a funny script and a fatal miscasting . 	Supporting actors Vera Farmiga and James Caan give the movie a little heft , but Henry 's Crime is an otherwise predictable heist/comedy with slow pacing .
funny people This is Apatow 's emotionally darkest , least-genial film , and an exceptionally good and subtle Sandler embraces the duality of his character , a man beloved by the world who secretly hates everyone . The weakest of the three films Apatow has directed -- though certainly not of the dozens he has produced -- but its shortcomings feel like growing pains rather than diminishing returns . Funny People is a film Apatow directed a decade too soon to perfect . But just you wait until 2019 , and then he 'll really bowl us over . Funny People comes across tentative and disjointed , with the filmmaker at the helm lacking the confidence to be truly daring . I ca n't spell out exactly how Funny People says so much about who these people are without showing its hand -- you 'll have to see Apatow in action to believe . Funny People is one of the most amusing , least sentimental films about mortality to come out of Hollywood . Sandler has great self-awareness and lets us laugh with him , at him and on occasion feel for a rich , spoiled superstar . With Funny People , Apatow - and Sandler - go deeper and deliver a touching piece that 's a totally different beast than Knocked Up or 40 Year Old Virgin . The fact is , this film is very funny , but because of the gravity of both the illness and Simmons trying to deal with his wasted life , the laughs are n't big , but rather more heartfelt and emotional . Why does Funny People often feel like a joke without a punchline ? 	Funny People features the requisite humor , as well as considerable emotional depth , resulting in Judd Apatow 's most mature film to date .
open range Open Range is actually pretty good . Costner 's epic , as director , is one to behold , not for its 24th hour sentimental about-face , but for the existential knack it has for the pacific , the stately and the quiet . Costner shows an exacting instinct for how to build a shoot-'em-up from the ground up . Kevin Costner brings us another epic Western , but Robert Duvall steals the show . It 's a considerable improvement over his last directing effort , the post-apocalyptic disaster The Postman . The saga length of the story might have had more impact with less bloat and mythic gravity , a tendency that seems to pursue Costner like an underfed bronco . Intriguing and clever enough to keep us gripped , even though nothing very surprising happens . In a summer where the Rocky-on-a-horse rip-off Seabiscuit is winning acclaim just for simply not being a sequel , here is a story that actually says something . Open Range , in spite of being a greatly entertaining film , is n't Oscar quality . But Duvall 's performance is . Costner finds in the Western something grand , familiar and new within a genre that clearly has some life in it yet . 	Greatly benefiting from the tremendous chemistry between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall , Open Range is a sturdy modern Western with classic roots .
10009055-rocker It 's totally predictable , but if you 've ever nursed a rock-star fantasy at any age , it 's impossible to hate this . And the three kids are really good . Audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker . The conflicts that arise are highly predictable . But there are plenty of funny moments , as well as a sweet subplot involving the unkempt drummer and the guitarist 's no-nonsense mom . The timing is a bit off with this routine , even if there are a few solos that totally kick ass . Despite the pointless pratfalls , the narrative 's engaging structure , progression and characterisation ensure that A.D.D . 's journey is easy and rewarding to follow . Certainly nothing this year will compete with the inexcusable The Love Guru for its sheer inability to create laughs , but The Rocker does its best to at least come close . The film equivalent of an inoffensive throwaway track , what we used to call a B-side , back in the days of Vesuvius . While The Rocker may be completely unoriginal and campy at times , the film still exceeds well with great laughs and a couple of one-liners I will be adding to my collection . This rock music comedy does has a few chuckles and belly laughs . And unlike a few other smug , self-satisfied comedies that have come along recently , this one at least seems to have a heart at its center . I 'm a drummer . Drummers are n't dorky . They are the heart and soul of a band , solid , dependable . Drummers are n't clueless or socially awkward . Guitarists on the other hand ... 	With a predictable and lightweight story , the earnest efforts of the cast are squandered by The Rocker 's bland script .
great debaters Washington punches every emotional and thematic point in Eisele 's script , which undermines the raw power of the story . The packed house I saw the film with applauded at the end . You will , too . These students , the movie tells us , went on to become major figures in the civil-rights movement - and seeing how they got there is an illuminating lesson . Resolved : No more movies can have inspiring , self-sacrificing teachers standing on desks . Ultimately , the film does work as an inspirational tale even if it requires way too much effort and patience on the viewer 's part before it gets there . There are enough things to admire about The Great Debaters , the heavily fictionalized true story of The Little Debate Team That Could , that your impulse is to forgive the movie its shortcomings . Washington succeeds in making debating as enthralling as contact sports . A sort of 'Glory Road ' or 'Pride ' rewrite that celebrates young people who are better at stringing words than shooting hoops or swimming laps . . . . an engaging look at a time and place when black men and women had to fight for dignity and respect against overwhelming forces Instead of exploiting this cruel reality , Washington 's camera records both scenes of joy and scenes of tragedy with equal composure , never milking for effect . 	A wonderful cast and top-notch script elevate The Great Debaters beyond a familiar formula for a touching , uplifting drama .

An overlong , dramatically unbalanced pic whose emotional wallop gets somewhat diffused . The Secret of the Grain never slows , always engages , may continue too long , but ends too soon . It is made of life itself . Before you scoff at yet another benevolent look at a family straddling two cultures , Kechiche subtly subverts the genre . Warmly magical ... Building to a tender Big Night-like feast where the gang 's all here , suspense is as thick and exciting as communal joy , and a single sexy surprise proves one of the greatest moments in film this year ... A long but always engaging movie , intimately framed and exuberantly acted by a mixed cast of amateurs and professionals . Time stretches out to the limits of endurance , Slimane 's and ours , and there are moments toward the conclusion of this picture when you will want to scream and throw things at the screen , but it 's mesmerizing . When it does end , suddenly , it feels a little The wonderful thing about Hafsia Herzi in The Secret of the Grain ... is the way she and the character tiptoe around the story 's edges for a while , taking their time and easing onto the audience 's radar . 	A complex portrait of an immigrant family , The Secret of the Grain is a sprawling , intimate film with many fine performances .
reader A young boy in post-war Germany has a torrid affair with an older woman , only to find out years later that she 's a Nazi war criminal , in director Stephen Daldry 's overwrought adaptation of the Bernhard Schlink novel . At heart what makes the film powerful is Winslet in so strong a performance and so totally different from anything she has done in the past Winslet gives a searing performance , one that often finds her unselfconsciously naked , as a woman who is willing to share her body and heart , but never the secret that defines her . Since more time is spent exposing the milky white breasts of Kate Winslet than exposing the horrors of the Holocaust , viewers might be forgiven for thinking they stumbled into a big-budget remake of Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS . Director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter David Hare exhibit a continued inability to thrillingly translate literary forms to the screen . Parental Content Review Outstanding performances define `` The Reader , '' but all pale in comparison with Kate Winslet 's Hanna . I believe the movie may be demonstrating a fact of human nature : Most people , most of the time , all over the world , choose to go along . We vote with the tribe . Takes a different approach to the Holocaust with a distinctive thematic blend of secrets , sex , guilt , and betrayal . a bit convoluted ... mostly absorbing and captivating drama elevated by strong performances . 	Despite Kate Winslet 's superb portrayal , The Reader suggests an emotionally distant , Oscar-baiting historical drama .
1104385-hannibal Does n't work as its own individual , self-contained cinematic entity . Hannibal is arguably the most visually stunning movie in what could be a horror-movie franchise . There are so many tactical errors in `` Hannibal '' that it 's hard to know where to start . You walk out of Hannibal a bit shocked and dazed , but ultimately unsatisfied . It 's as if Scott served you an appetizer and a dessert , but forgot the entree . A disappointment . If you regard Hannibal as a sequel to The Silence Of The Lambs , the only possible result is disappointment . Hannibal Lecter is the ostensible cannibal of this franchise , but the real cannibals are his creators . I would n't be surprised if the next time , they have him endorsing his favorite Chianti . Hannibal is a beautiful mess . Take your joys when you can because the well is often dry . Riveting suspense spiced with diabolical laughs and garnished with a sprig of kinky romance add up to the tastiest dish around . As a straight-up sequel it fails to match the original in any way . As a spectacle ... it works a little better . 	While superbly acted and stylishly filmed , Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing .
repo the genetic opera Bousman 's editing and camera angles are consistently inventive , and the production design ( Blade Runner is a big influence , as is Disneyland 's `` Haunted Mansion '' attraction ) squeezes a lot of bang out of every buck . Repo ! is a bloody grotesquerie , not a delicious delight as was Rocky Horror . All-out thriller with few Bond touches but plenty of high-octane action . somewhere between Nine Inch Nails and The Rocky Horror Picture Show There is too much ambition on display for the film to be completely dismissed , but good intentions carry Repo ! only partway toward success . Falling somewhere between Rocky Horror , Moulin Rouge ! and Eyes Without A Face ( with songs ! ) , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is the filmic equivalent of what architects call a 'folly ' . It 's not often you come across a film as unique as this , and while my taste for liver , lights , and sweetbreads is n't what it once was , this is still a fine post-Halloween aperitif , with guts to spare . [ A ] gory , off-putting musical , which tries to combine Gothic rock stylings with the grotesque sensibilities of so-called , 'torture-porn ' horror-thrillers . No , fans of `` Mamma Mia ! '' wo n't be too thrilled with `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera . '' The lowbrow and highfalutin collide in an orgy of upscale disembowelment as director Darren Lynn Bousman gives uneasy birth to the gore opera . 	Bombastic and intentionally gross , Repo ! The Genetic Opera has a unique style but lacks the wit and substance to be involving .
martha marcy may marlene A star-making turn from the Olsen twins ' baby sis will put this disturbing drama on the map . A compelling film about the visceral facts of the depressing , confusing , exciting , terrifying moment that its protagonist is stuck in . Every society has its traps , the film suggests . ... But they 're not equally corrupt . There 's a clear sign hanging over the road less traveled , and it says 'Wrong Way . ' That the film works so effectively is in large part due to the terrific performances by Olsen and Hawkes and the way they play off each other . As the film peels layers of mystery , it suggests -- not entirely persuasively -- that its heroine 's alternate lifestyles both represent cults , of a type . Neither the thriller the trailer suggests , not the feminine , visual poem the poster suggests , this is a film about loss of self that is absolutely clear about its own identity An imaginative psychological study of a woman torn between two ways of life . Olsen nails her perpetual state of worry so keenly that it elevates her struggle to the scale of existential tragedy . 'Martha ' should earn new Olsen sister a cult following . The haunting film that serves as a coming-out party for a startling young talent , Elizabeth Olsen..unsettling and accomplished . 	Led by a mesmerizing debut performance from Elizabeth Olsen , Martha Marcy May Marlene is a distinctive , haunting psychological drama .
kid stays in the picture Watching [ it ] , one of the best movies of the year , is pure bliss . A terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . Even at his most obnoxious , Evans remains a fascinating figure . A snazzy kick -- it 's never less than hugely entertaining -- that should in no way be mistaken for an unbiased account . I was pleasantly surprised by how fascinating this documentary is . Picture Perfect Despite some reservations , this is an interesting and excellent documentary ... An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . The audience ca n't tell where the embellishing is , nor should it care -- the portrait Evans paints is involving and entertaining . This kid certainly stayed in the picture and was resilient enough to stick around and witness the rolling ending credits of his own tantalizing production . 	Though not objective by any means , The Kid Stays in the Picture is irresistibly entertaining .
shame 2011 Fassbender delivers a huge ... sorry engorged ... no that 's not it um ... SWOLLEN ... . No LARGE ... no utterly incredible , nuanced and compelling performance . Fassbender explores the most lurid and tortured aspects of Brandon 's life with a physical and emotional wholeheartedness that is frequently uncomfortable to witness . How can visual pleasure communicate existential misery ? It is a real and interesting challenge , and if `` Shame '' falls short of meeting it , the seriousness of its effort is hard to deny . Rather than a stern treatise on the dangers of sexual addiction , McQueen 's approach allows viewers to enter into the situation at their own pace and find their own emotional connection . The key is Fassbender , who is terrifyingly good . It may be hard to sympathise with a man as well endowed and frequently bed-bound as Brandon , but Shame 's success rests on its ability to rise above controversial talking points and be a thoughtful character drama about the lengths people go to dull pain . Lower your expectations.Scene for scene , effectively intense , with fierce performances , but McQueen sets up a narrative and never follows through.Why are these people damaged ? It is so very well made that one can only wish there were a little more to it than the fleshy mechanics of trauma . It is a film to admire greatly , but not truly enjoy - much like Brandon 's attitude to the call girl . Buoyed by a tour-de-force performance by Fassbender , `` Shame '' is an in-depth look at a man whose priorities and emotions are out of control . Shame smears the lines between daring and taunting , and art versus indulgence . When it ends there 's the urge to take a shower , and not a cold one . 	Boasting stellar performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan , Shame is a powerful plunge into the mania of addiction affliction .
nightcrawler A full-on masterpiece . Darkly funny , frightening , and action-packed . An intriguing neo-noir take on a world most of us are happily oblivious to . A true original , and a totally awesome entertainment , all the more so if you like your satire as bitter and black as a Turkish espresso . The good-to-see Rene Russo plays the ratings-happy producer showing off Bloom 's wares on a nightly basis , but this is strictly the often chilling Gyllenhaal 's one-man show . Jake Gyllenhaal 's 'nightcrawling ' TV cameraman drags ambulance-chasing to a new low in this disturbing tale of a creepy sociopath feeding TV 's blood-thirst for the goriest footage . ... the best Martin Scorsese movie not directed by Scorsese . It 's that good , that assured ... that unshakable ... Scores as both urban thriller and 'Network'-like comment on the media . That Gyllenhaal totally commits to Lou ca n't be questioned . The actor seamlessly embodies this strange and scary man , finding ways to turn his fidgety tics and baleful glances into reams of telling information . It 's a slinky black cat of a movie , commanding attention and reeling you in to follow down filthy , dangerous alleys . [ VIDEO ESSAY ] Jake Gyllenhaal 's canny portrayal delivers a revelatory character study of an opportunistic sociopath working all the angles in a system built on propaganda . [ Gyllenhaal 's character ] might be the post-recession cousin of Christian Bale in American Psycho . It 's as if Humphrey Bogart had a baby face , lost all his marbles , and gotten a subscription to the Harvard Business Review . The nearly two hour long movie is a wild ride , particularly as fueled by Gyllenhaal 's edgy , nuanced , and completely mesmerizing performance . ( Complete Content Review for Parents also available ) 	Restless , visually sleek , and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal , Nightcrawler offers dark , thought-provoking thrills .
the girl with the dragon tattoo It 's certainly worth seeing if you missed the original . If you saw it , however , there 's no way of unseeing it , and nothing in the new one to top it . I do n't think I 've seen an actor do more with deadpan expressions than Mara does in this movie . Her face does n't move but , whether she 's tasing a man or standing in front of a mirror watching a cigarette dangle from her mouth , we respond to her . Utterly engaging , a transporting bit of cinema that immerses viewers -- uncomfortably at times -- in a riveting detective story . For all its meticulously crafted mood and mise en scne , The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is little more than great filmmaking in service of bad art . Fincher takes repeated stabs at creating depth but seldom draws blood in attempting to flesh out characters that just are n't that interesting . Fincher maintains a steady tension throughout . He also adds his own tweaks to the twists at the end . Fincher has delivered a visually striking , well-acted , at times stomach-churning thriller , but I still ca n't help but wish that he had taken a curve ball and continued exploring new territory rather than taking a big swing at an easy toss A mesmerizing movie that veers towards an unbearably tense climax , The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo benefits from invigorating direction and superb acting that allows the old-fashioned mystery to unravel in a hugely satisfying and captivating way . What transfixes here is n't the labyrinthine plotting -- we 're almost overly familiar with that by now -- but Mara 's Lisbeth , surely one of the most incendiary antiheroines in all of cinema Reminds us why murder mysteries and investigative procedurals -- useful parables about the certainty of death that have pretty much migrated to television -- can be especially compelling in a darkened theater . 	Brutal yet captivating , The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the result of David Fincher working at his lurid best with total role commitment from star Rooney Mara .
pacifier Diesel loses steam as he aims for the family audience The film does n't succeed on any level . An unnecessarily morbid premise that sits uneasily with the slapstick comedy that follows . If you truly love your children , you will take them to see a different movie . A lame-as-lame-can-be bust . Disney 's new family flick is chipper and occasionally clever as it sends up the high-tech know-how required by 21st-century parents . A by-the-books Disney family film . If this is what you are looking for , Diesel delivers an easy , goodwill charm . The preview audience embraced it . [ A ] frenzied , cumbersome tangle of potty jokes . Maybe it 's a good thing the film is nearly a complete wreck , because it does provide a strong reminder just how much care and effort went into Kindergarten Cop . Sheer boredom , unless you 're under the age of 7 . 	Vin Diesel parodies his tough guy image for the family audience , but the result is only moderately amusing .
broken flowers Moving , mirthful and minimalist , Broken Flowers is a bittersweet treat from indie great Jim Jarmusch . Aggressively unsatisfying . It is an anti-road film that is also anti-entertaining . This is a film about insufficiency on so many levels , a film not of hipster indifference , but of a certain effete inability to react . No actor is better than Bill Murray as doing nothing at all , and being fascinating while not doing it . Jarmusch and Murray can mix fine mood martinis , yet their film is all vapors and hints , murmurs and ricochets ... these flowers wilt before they can break . Admittedly , some may find the movie 's pacing a bit self-indulgent and its sense of humor more than a little odd , but this rewarding , cinematic voyage of self-discovery also provides some real food for thought . `` A simple and blissful melding of sensibilities which may be the year 's best film thus far . '' Sweetly peaceful & quirky , warmly awkward , daring , top not acting by Murray . But road shots drag , drab image quality distracts , climax wanes . A movie of uncommon sweetness and delight . Jarmusch 's movies are rigorously strategized and impeccably designed , and his attention to detail testifies to an intense commitment to a personal vision . 	Bill Murray 's subtle and understated style complements director Jim Jarmusch 's minimalist storytelling in this quirky , but deadpan comedy .
after.life Either you 'll go with After.Life 's conceit or you wo n't . Even if you do , you 're left with more questions about its plausibility than you 'll be comfortable with . On a plot level , few of the psychodrama elements make much sense . Has some first-timer flaws but avoids 'cheesy horror movie ' status by serious tapping into the vein Poe mined for premature burial . a distasteful exercise in the proper disposition of the deceased during funeral preparations with less blood in it than the corpses that populate it Wojtowicz-Vosloo just piles on the nonsense back and forth in a laughably incomprehensible muddle . Boiled down to what 's actually presented , the whole movie is misdirection , executed without any subtlety . I do n't think we 're expected to take After.Life any more seriously than Ricci 's last extended ( near ) nude role in the immortal Black Snake Moan . That one was more fun . makes you think too much about what it 's doing , rather than what it 's about , thus drawing you away from the deeper philosophical questions of life and death at its core Neeson clearly relishes the role , but he never plays to the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic . The character 's motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last . It 's too dull for grown-ups and too nightmarish for children . It makes Nip/Tuck look like a Mel Brooks musical . 	It has an interesting premise and admirable ambitions , but After.Life fails to deliver enough twists or thrills to sustain its creepy atmosphere .
fahrenheit 911 Michael Moore stirs the political pot again with this incendiary documentary . Unlike Bowling For Columbine , which editorially often seemed something less than the sum of its sketch-comedy parts , Fahrenheit 9/11 makes its case carefully and clearly . See it and start engaging in the national debate . The aftermath of an event as tragic and important as Sept. 11 deserves nothing less than our most intense scrutiny . The film does n't go for satirical humor the way Moore 's Roger & Me and Bowling for Columbine did . Moore 's narration is still often sarcastic , but frequently he lets his footage speak for itself . The information here is n't necessarily new , but it is packaged in an acid-tongued way along with powerhouse visuals that drive home the filmmaker 's nakedly political views . provides a welcome relief to the relentless right wing banter of Rush Limbaugh and his minions It 's not compelling ; in fact , there are times when it 's not especially interesting . An unbridled carpet-bombing of fury and savage ridicule , Fahrenheit 9/11 is this year 's most explosive film . In pure filmic terms , Fahrenheit 911 is a second-rate documentary , but it is first-rate entertainment and top-notch muckraking . More than just a recitation of facts , parts of it are very moving . 	Extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush administration , but worth watching for the humor and the debates it 'll stir .
the homesman If this sounds like The African Queen meets Rooster Cogburn , be aware that flashes of sardonic humour and painful poignancy are to be gratefully received in a sombre , grim , frequently horrific depiction of the pioneer experience . Jones is n't interested in making a movie about archetypes ; he 's making a movie about people . And people can surprise you . `` The Homesman '' certainly surprised me , and still haunts me . A grand , shocking saga of a movie , The Homesman is the kind they do n't make much anymore . The Homesman is a bleak , thoughtful glimpse into Western life that , thanks to Tommy Lee Jones ' direction , finds ample intrigue without needing shoot-outs , dynamite , or any massive action pieces . Jones captures stark and disturbing moments with a matter-of-factness that 's neither overstated nor flippantly casual . It 's no revelation that this was a dangerous time and place , and he does n't treat it as such . Few will regret having seen `` The Homesman , '' and yet it 's not exactly an enjoyable experience . Uses a familiar genre format to subtly subvert conventions , blending the old-fashioned and the progressive into a story that can be unexpectedly powerful . Director/Star Tommy Lee Jones confounds , making brilliant American cinema on the back of the blockbuster dime from Men in Black , the Fugitive -- and Ameriprise ads . Hilary Swank goes spare and true paired with Rodrigo Prieto 's restrained camerawork . The Homesman tries to cut a mordant , witty Coen Brothers line between tragedy and comedy and ca n't quite manage either . Tommy Lee Jones ' face is a national treasure , is it not ? Is there a face on the screen as wizened , as ruined , as made for playing men who 've seen unspeakable things ? 	A squarely traditional yet somewhat progressive Western , The Homesman adds another absorbing entry to Tommy Lee Jones ' directorial rsum .
broadway the golden age [ The subjects ] eagerly unwind before McKay 's one-man camera , reminiscing about everything from their finest hours to the days when ticket prices still ran in single digits . Its appeal is n't likely to cross over to those who do n't already have the Broadway bug , or share the recollections themselves . Whether it 's Julie Harris weeping as she recalls an Ethel Waters performance she saw 60 years ago or Marian Seldes lamenting the cruelty of show biz or Ann Miller blithely carving a decade off her age , there 's no arguing that these years were golden . Broadway buffs everywhere are sure to applaud . These anecdotes come across with powerful emotion , although many of them relay oft-documented events . If you 've ever fantasized about sitting in an all-night deli listening to veteran theater people dish and reminiscence about the Great White Way in mid-20th century bloom , filmmaker Rick McKay 's cascading cavalcade of talking heads is the next best thing . This is a picture that devotees of the American theatre will cherish . It takes more than a fan to analyze the legacy of a period . But a fan is just what it takes to indulge in that legacy , which is exactly what Broadway : The Golden Age is all about . With all those heads talking , there 's precious little time for singing and dancing , though more than enough for a consensus to form around cherished memories of the bigger personalities . Manages to immerse us in the moment , Broadway from the late '40s to the mid-'60s , even if we were n't there . 	Broadway : The Golden Age is a breezy , affectionate tribute to a sparkling array of the era 's best and brightest .
madeo Bong is less interested in shocks than in the synergy between the country 's vast fields and the equally mysterious inner landscape of the dazed matriarch making her way across them . Another quality Bong hit . There 's just as surely a monster lurking in the frames of Bong Joon-ho 's latest , though its actual form is less defined than in his previous feature , The Host . Bold , unpredictable and quietly devastating , Mother is Bong 's first masterpiece . By far the most memorable thing about Mother is Hye-ja 's impassioned performance Bong is a talent to heed . Kim Hye-ja is a dynamo of determination at the center of Bong Joon-ho 's latest drama . No subtlety allowed . Though diligently paced and sharp to look at , the mysteries inside Mother are , finally , bloodless . Turns genre conventions on their head in creating a thoroughly engrossing mixture of murder mystery , psychological thriller and very black comedy . It is Hye-ja Kim that carries Mother , making her mother of a Mother an all-suffering , all-enduring victim who acquires more spine and subtler shadings as the story deliberately , patiently reveals its secrets . 	As fleshy as it is funny , Bong Joon-Ho 's Mother straddles family drama , horror and comedy with a deft grasp of tone and plenty of eerie visuals .
lilo and stitch For all the weighty issues involved , this movie remains very entertaining , full of Elvis songs and scenes that will make both parents and kids laugh . Maybe someday , just once , a Disney animated film will surprise us . Disney sci-fi action-comedy goes Hawaiian , rejecting formula and finding freshness and fun . Even if you care nothing about Lilo turning snarly gremlin Stitch into a surfin ' huggie , you can still slack into a Don the Beachcomber drift . Sharply creative and surprisingly human Like Stitch 's spacecraft crashlanding on the Hawaiian island of Kauai , Disney 's Lilo & Stitch is a bolt from the blue . That rarest of family films -- an experience that delivers for all factions . A quirky , welcome addition to Disney 's cavalcade of animated stars . Despite its charms , and the refreshingly non-traditional characters , Lilo & Stitch seems diluted and too derivative to be as effective as one wants it to be . A very charming and funny movie . This movie is by no means a classic in absolute artistic terms , but as a reaffirmation of all but forgotten verities it 's an unqualified success . 	Edgier than traditional Disney fare , Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story .
sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 It 's a film that probably will please its targeted viewer more than it did me . Very much a loyal sequel to its predecessor , essentially showing that if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . Traveling Pants 2 offers more of the same and , I 'm afraid , more of the same and more of the same . A solid if not wholly necessary sequel , but Carmen , Tibby , Lena and Bridget are so pleasant to spend a couple hours with that it hardly matters . Tamblyn , Lively , Ferrara and Bledel have a sparkling chemistry that transcends the subpar material , and the Greek-island conclusion is so picturesque you can almost overlook the predictable histrionics . An unnecessary continuation that is strangely dour and populated by a quartet of actresses who seem as if they would rather be doing anything than living up to their contractual obligations to appear in a sequel now that they have better things to do Packed with emotions and the angst of growing up , `` The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 '' fits an older audience than the first movie . Teenage girls ( and women getting in touch with their inner teenager ) will have a fine time ... There 's sex and the city ( New York ) . But the most enjoyable girls-night-out movie of the summer deals with young , fledgling love . It 's a movie that recognizes our flaws , but tells us we can rise above them -- and when we do , what we find will be worth it . 	The workable chemistry among the four leads combined with the enriching message make for a winning Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 .
the-great-mouse-detective An amiable little trifle that entertains during its scant running time . It 's a lot of fun . Pedestrian Disney cartoon w/nice Vincent Price voice-over . If the film fails to click on all the emotional levels that Disney might have wanted , at least it 's a brightly-paced bit of comedy and fun . Certainly not up to snuff with the old-time Disney classics , but quite entertaining all the same . ... intended mainly for kids , most audiences , young and old , will get a kick out of it . ... the film is entertaining in its own low-key manner . Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters -- the Disney Studio 's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary -- but they will love the cute , brave mice and cheer their triumphs . Adults will enjoy the wit and style . Not classic , but the start of something good . Clever Sherlock Holmes tribute mixes wit , peril . The next best Holmes to Jeremy Brett . 	The Great Mouse Detective may not rank with Disney 's classics , but it 's an amiable , entertaining picture with some stylishly dark visuals .
shadow magic Makes us appreciate what today 's audiences take for granted : the miracle of the cinema . The film is at its best as a document of a changing culture and also as a loving essay on the power of cinema . The characters are wholly lacking in any real depth , each possessing but a single scripted personality trait . Effectively reminds us how revolutionary some of today 's gadgets were just a century ago . Plays like a Chinese Cinema Paradiso , full of feeling without succumbing to sentimentality . In her debut film , director and producer Ann Hu creates a beautiful world with strong characters , both main and supporting . What an unremarkable movie this is . Transports us to a world that still had a capacity for awe , and that 's the core of its charm . A thrilling experience , a history lesson for those who do n't like history as well as those who are intrigued by the past . The film is often charming and sweet . 	Charmingly sweet , Shadow Magic captures the sense of wonder of audiences experiencing the world of motion pictures for the first time .
the secret world of arrietty While Arrietty lacks the originality and imagination of many in the Studio Ghibli catalogue , it has the heart , warmth and beauty of its predecessors and is certain to leave you feeling moved . As a beautiful , simple ode to the dreams and longings of childhood , and the power of imagination hand drawn onto the frame , it could hardly be more charming . But one longs for the rippling sense of the unreal that once lingered beneath the surface . A great kids ' movie , but , as usual with Ghibli films , not in any way just for kids . This is one of those movies that you see because it is worth literally seeing . Like motion picture Yoga -- quietly cathartic and just the thing to raise your kids on . This smart , winsome fairy tale is not quite Hiyao Miyazaki , but it still might be the best animated film that ( some few ) will see all year . Arrietty offers an opportunity to be carried away by a whimsical adventure , set to a lovely score by French musician Ccile Corbel . Does n't possess the epic scope fans might be used to from regal Ghibli offerings , but it retains a lovely spirit of adventure and alliance , forming a modest but sublime picture worthy of the exalted brand name . The Secret World of Arrietty is a return to the land of imagination that is so often the basis for these beautiful films , which continually show that animation can be so much more than just a cartoon . While not my favorite Studio Ghibli film , I think The Secret World of Arrietty is well worth checking out with the rest of the family . 	Visually lush , refreshingly free of family-friendly clatter , and anchored with soulful depth , The Secret World of Arrietty lives up to Studio Ghibli 's reputation .
1004151-christmas story A Yuletide viewing favorite . Never fails to take me back to a place of welcomed innocence yet it does n't make me wish I were back there . A classic . My family watches it every Christmas . My sons tell me I 'm getting to be more like the old man with each passing year . It has a warmth and humor that soar with the season . It wo n't make anyone forget Miracle on 34th Street , but this is pleasant fare as far as holiday films go nowadays , which is n't very far . It 's so sweet but it has the cynical heart of pre-WWII America . If you 're a fan of Christmas movies or films that use nostalgia as a driver , A Christmas Story can not be missed . Then again , if you 're in either category , you have probably already seen it . Sweet , funny and loaded with warm nostalgia . A comfortable , homey movie . 	Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous , A Christmas Story deserves its status as a holiday perennial .

Miss Bala is one of the highlights of the year so far for me , a powerful experience , and Naranjo is , without a doubt , a born filmmaker . Sigman 's performance is , literally , the film . The topical subject may draw larger-than-usual audiences , as will the undeniably formidable technical achievements . Naranjo keeps the action tense but understated ; instead of allowing explosions and shootouts to pile up , he rations them in taut doses . ... an audacious yet hopelessly uninvolving art-house thriller that peters out significantly in the buildup to its anticlimactic finale . 	Miss Bala 's subject is loaded enough , but the frantic and muscular filmmaking puts this movie in a whole new league .
starred up Poses pertinent questions about institutional corruption , the criminal ecosystem and how the taxpayer 's representatives become willing accomplices . This is the toughest , grittiest prison drama I 've seen since 'Hunger ' ( 2008 ) . This is a very well written and acted drama with an unforgettable climax . Brutally realistic prison melodrama without pat answers . Turns the complicated dynamic between a young prisoner and his problematic mentor into a ferocious psychodrama that locks you in and refuses to let you go . Two of the year 's best male performances give depth to the film 's fascinating character study . As it portrays the battle of wills between two men for one savable youth 's soul , Starred Up unostentatiously depicts other integral aspects of prison life-administrative corruption and homosexuality , as well as racism . Expect to hear a lot more from English actor Jack O'Connell , who holds the screen as well as his character , Eric , commands a cellblock . It 's almost as difficult to sit through `` Starred Up '' as it is satisfying to watch it . Starred Up , like its characters , never loses face , never compromises its bloodily-earned hard-man cred , yet its real agenda is one of compassion . The British prison movie Starred Up has the excitement of a nonstop psychological cage fight , but its goal is enlightenment , not terror or cheap thrills . 	Smart , hard-hitting , and queasily realistic , Starred Up is an instant classic of U.K. prison cinema .
ten These 10 sequences are moments frozen in time , which reveal a surprising amount about the emotional lives of the movie 's characters . By the end you feel that the lives of the characters , and the complicated society they inhabit , have been illuminated . A very interesting film , despite structural limitations that keep it from approaching greatness . One of the year 's finest movies . A major minimalist departure for Kiarostami . ... a marvelous tension between the formal design and the improvisational style . A little more reach would have allowed Ten to turn it up to 11 . No ordinary moviegoer , whether Iranian or American , can be expected to relate to [ Kiarostami 's ] films . They exist for film festivals , film critics and film classes . It shows us , in an extraordinarily simple way , the hopes and frustrations of one woman 's life . ... a bracing glimpse of another culture . 	Ten turns a conversational car ride into a gritty and compelling character study full of real emotion while providing an intriguing look into the lives of women in contemporary Iranian culture .
capturing the friedmans one of the most compelling examples of documentary filmmaking ever produced Sympathy turns into condemnation and then twists back again , depending on whose version of what happened we 're listening to . . . .a powerful and disturbing work . . .The immediacy of this film makes it truly a modern documentary . Grown men and women , in broad daylight and friendly company , would not lightly name some of the worst terrors of our world . Disturbing and deleterious cinema . Without a doubt a disconcertingly engrossing , difficult-to-shake experience . A vividly personal , devastating story of a family that was hopelessly compromised years before it was scapegoated for crimes that two of its members may or may not have committed . Jarecki 's deft organization of the factual material provides the momentum for a never-flagging exposition of the complexities of the Friedman case In some respects , Jarecki just scratches the surface of the material , and the film is often coy and withholding . Yet it 's also riveting and so suggestive that you ca n't consume it passively : You have to brood on it . A pretty unremarkable film about a remarkable situation . 	A haunting depiction of a disintegrating family , and a powerful argument on the elusiveness of truth .
deuce bigelow european gigolo Rob Schneider 's shtick still amounts to little more than shameless self-deprecation . It 's as though he 'll do anything for a laugh -- except elevate the humor itself . Hardcore fans of The Howard Stern Show will worship at the altar of the various low-rent attempts to outdo the hair gel scene in There 's Something About Mary . It 's good to know someone can still make a good stupid movie , a movie that knows how to laugh at itself instead of merely catering to mankind 's lowest instincts . It is what it is , and sometimes a little own-skin comfort goes a long way . It is the first work by a director named Mike Bigelow . I assume he got the job because of his name . One day he 'll look back on this and weep bitter , salty tears . It would be best appreciated by ( a ) children of blind , castrated , hearing-impaired Hollywood executives suffering from Tourette 's syndrome and arrested development , ( b ) comic actor-writers who look like Richard Simmons . Schneider ... does n't have the talent to turn raunch into comedic gold . The worst movie of the year ; it gets an unprecedented half point on our rating scale - even a penis enlargement pump could n't suck a whole point out of this movie . European Gigolo is more slapdash than its predecessor , and its jokes , albeit blue , are more borrowed than new . Any goodwill Rob Schneider was able to wring out of his Deuce Bigalow character the first time around has been stomped into the dirt by the constant , overwhelming , disgusting , over-the-top teenage bathroom humor in the sequel . 	A witless follow-up to the surprise 1999 hit , Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo is raunchy , politically incorrect , and not particularly funny .
penelope2008 Resembling the kind of tale Aesop might spin after one too many vats of homemade Ouzo , Penelope plods along on a desire to endear . All it really does is infuriate . Just downright lovely , a gorgeous fairy tale for children and grown-ups alike . There are some lovely touches , yet it 's as if someone forgot to sprinkle fairy dust on it . This half-baked fairy tale always seems to be on the verge of becoming charming but despite a good cast it never quite succeeds . Maybe I 've got some subconscious porcine fetish thing going ( or something ) but I think Christina Ricci looks kind of cute with a pig 's snout where her nose should be ... Mark Palansky goes for Tim Burton-by-Jean-Pierre Jeunot whimsicality with Penelope , a storybook fable that never overplays its cutesiness but also fails to figure out what it wants to be . A Cinderella story via Shrek and Tim Burton , Penelope is at its best when we 're gazing into those eyes , or seeing the world through them . Unfortunately , Penelope only masquerades as a film about self-acceptance and liking ourselves for who we are . A fairy tale that may make millions of girls re-think that nose job . A film of some ragged charm -- and one in which there 's always something cool to look at in design and filmmaking style . And that 's more than a lot of movies can claim . 	Though Penelope has a charming cast and an appealing message , it ultimately suffers from faulty narrative and sloppy direction .
garfield 2 It 's fast , it 's moderately amusing and it will keep the kids giggling for a quick 80 minutes . The movie is only 78 minutes long , but that 's 78 minutes you could spend with your child reading A.A. Milne or Lewis Carroll or just about the entire output of Dr. Seuss . Or -- to pick a more relevant example -- Mark Twain . Good kitty ! Superior in every way to its underwhelming predecessor , Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties is a genuinely clever kidpic that should delight moppets , please parents -- and maybe tickle a few tweens . Anyone want to see animals making lasagna or sporting party hats at a pool party ? The new Garfield movie is a cat-astrophe . Painful . Our kids deserve better . The 'best ' part is that it looks better than the previous Garfield movie , where the computer-animated kitty 's weird glow made him resemble a nightlight that could n't decide if it wanted to soothe or terrify kids . You 'll only be attracted to Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties if you 're very young , you 're very easily entertained , or you just ca n't get enough of Jim Davis 's lasagna-scarfing cartoon cat . This is lowest common denominator movie-making . It 's all obvious and synthetic , derivative to the point of plagiarism . Hopefully , Garfield does n't really have nine lives , because that would mean suffering through seven more sequels . 	Strictly for ( very ) little kids , A Tale of Two Kitties features skilled voice actors but a plot that holds little interest .
accepted Even the characters in the movie are saying at the beginning , 'This is crazy . This will never work . ' And I 'm like , you know what ? You 're right . It never will . Not for one second . Even in a whacky comedy like this . Could possibly gain Frat Pack pledge Justin Long his own acceptance . None of them will teach you anything you did n't already know -- but at least you 'll have a good time until class is dismissed . More disconcerting is the idea put forward that self-indulgence is a substitute for structured education , or , more to the point , that it 's a substitute for life . It 's not a perfect movie , and its story is ludicrous , but darned if it is n't charming in its bald-faced preposterousness . One could argue that you should n't expect a teen comedy to offer a nuanced depiction of the role of education in public life , but in response I 'd refer you to Election and Clueless . The point is , should the writers of Accepted , writers whose main credits encompass Country Bears , Herbie : Fully Loaded and an Olsen twins movie , be making light of anyone 's career trajectory ? Congenial , mildly anarchic , and generally inoffensive , Accepted feels like it 's holding itself back , which also keeps it from being thoroughly engaging . Grown ups who ca n't get the joke may simply be jealous they ca n't go back and do it all over again themselves . Give the new college comedy Accepted half credit for having the gumption to marry two previously unrelated , seminal classics in American arts and letters . 	Like its characters who are n't able to meet their potential , Accepted 's inconsistent and ridiculous plot gets annoying , despite a few laughs .
supercop It 's a blast to watch the action sequences , which offer more than just hand-to-hand martial arts . Supercop is a chance to get a full-strength blast of Chan . This is riotous fun throughout . The plot is nothing more than an excuse for the series of spectacular action sequences in which Chan shows both his physical skills and great sense of humour . It 's not my favorite Jackie Chan film , but it 's still a good one . If you 're tired of burned-out coppers in Hollywood 's blockbusters , try this offbeat hero from Hong Kong . A wild and free-wheeling action film , vastly superior to this year 's Rumble in the Bronx in both plot and action . Do n't go into this film expecting a lot of deep meaning or heavy emotions , but if you like action films you will be entertained . Supercop is n't art , but it sure is great junk food . The final half-hour makes it all worthwhile , and what makes Chan 's work continually astonishing is that the actor does all his own stunts . 	Blending hand-to-hand combat with breathtaking stunts and slapstick comedy , Supercop reminds us why Jackie Chan is one of the world 's great entertainers .
moolaade It 's masterful , simple and wise . Every character is a symbol for Sembene to realize his humanistic visions in a folklore type of cinema . While presenting a fascinating view of contemporary Africa , Sembene masterfully focuses on the human costs of the traditional practices . Tackles a seriously important issue without losing the vibrant energy of everyday life . Moolaad imagines progress toward increased equality , across races , genders , nations , and generations . A stirring vision of civil but pointed disobedience . The film is remarkable for its depiction of the everyday life and chores of a vanishing culture , and for making its points with clarity and precision . Once again Sembne confirms his much-deserved reputation as Africa 's greatest filmmaker . A rare feature-film glimpse into African traditions and culture , Moolaade is part colorful travelogue , part social criticism , but mostly human drama . `` Moolaade '' works as a stirring parable for any community where progressive citizens and regressive policies collide . 	A vibrant , powerful , and poignant glimpse into the struggles of women in modern Africa .
the-evil-dead One of the scariest , goriest , and ( oddly enough ) funniest horror movies of its time , and it 's every bit deserving of being called a cult classic . Director Sam Raimi burst onto the horror scene with this crude cult favourite that 's short on story but long on excessive gore and innovative camerawork . A great , genuinely unnerving horror movie . ... certainly notable as the announcement of an eager talent , but I 'd have a difficult time praising the picture as much more than that . Terrifying when it came out , hilarious now . Funny thing is it 's equally enjoyable either way . Crude , gory , scary , funny , Sam Raimi relly knows how to make a good movie with almost no money A testament to how bliss and the spark of inspiration can elevate a film of any budget in any genre from routine to sublime . Sam Raimi directed this 1983 horror feature fresh out of film school , and his anything-for-an-effect enthusiasm pays off in lots of formally inventive bits . It 's Raimi 's keen eye ( and ear ) for audiovisual intoxication that makes this creeper a home run . If you can overlook the mostly lame-o acting , cheeseball effects and fumbling drama , there 's enough fledgling genius here to fill another thousand horror movies . 	This classic low budget horror film combines just the right amount of gore and black humor , giving The Evil Dead an equal amount of thrills and laughs .
school of rock School of Rock tackles its familiar formula with a welcome mixture of reverence , intelligence , and clich moderation . The School of Rock may be the best 'inspirational teacher ' movie ever made . Jack Black ... deftly guides the family film away from the genre 's usual mawkishness and into a sort of Bad-Company-meets-Peter-Pan Rock 'n ' Roll Never Never Land . [ A ] great big ball of entertainment ... An inspired , invigorating comedy that will have you laughing from its opening moments to its closing credits . It 's been ages since I 've seen a movie as joyous , as sweet and as hilarious . One of the sweetest , most appealing comedies to come along in quite some time , and much of that can be attributed to Black , who reveals a considerably more tender side here . A film about the passion of rock and teaching , School of Rock thrives off the talent of its youthful cast and Richard Linklater 's storytelling . Rock and Roll Forever ! .. a familiar song -- the journey of arrested adolescent/adult Dewey Finn ( Jack Black ) to maturity , helped along the way by the wisdom of children -- but the fun is in the performance . The movie is predictable and formulaic , but it counters with a disarming charm , it does n't condescend and Black 's performance is a jewel of youthful enthusiasm . 	Black 's exuberant , gleeful performance turns School of Rock into a hilarious , rocking good time .
watchmen Fans of the 1986 graphic novel Watchmen should be pleased with the eye-filling , slavishly faithful , long-time-coming film version that opens today and threatens to become the first true movie event of 2009 . The comic 's tag line was `` Who Watches the Watchmen ? '' and if you 're not among those who are , you 're likely missing out on the comic book film of the year . Watchmen is n't a superhero movie , it 's a pretentious turkey that thinks it 's better than the genre . The approach is depressingly literal , and none of the scenes build on what has come before -- they 're just meticulously reconstructed Scenes From Watchmen . Watchmen is astonishing . It is indubitably the most lavish adaptation of a graphic novel ever made and quite possibly one of the finest book-to-screen endeavors ever produced . Snyder has been unable to create a satisfying tone for the proceedings . While the graphic novel played everything as realistically as it could , the film feels artificially stylized and inappropriately cartoonish . Watchmen deserves credit for staying true to the characters , plot ( up to a point ) , and look of the original material while still generating his own kind of energy , even though that energy sometimes feels misapplied and overcranked . A pretentious , over-long , pseudointellectual mess . Self-indulgent and boring , this overhyped dud is one major waste of time . Synder has achieved what many said was impossible ; he has in-fact filmed the unfilmable , and arguably done so as well as anyone could have . It was n't that I was n't engaged in some of the ( many ) story lines , it 's just that there was never enough time spent with any particular one to so as to become emotionally involved ... which seem strange to say about a movie 165 minutes long . 	Gritty and visually striking , Watchmen is a faithful adaptation of Alan Moore 's graphic novel , but its complex narrative structure may make it difficult for it to appeal to viewers not already familiar with the source material .
our lady of the assassins It 's not necessarily the 'reality ' that makes Assassins so compelling , it 's the decisions Fernando makes on his way to the supposed coffin . In Schroeder 's careful hands , Colombia becomes a mythic land where the successful delivery of drugs to the US becomes cause for celebration . The grimness of the movie becomes not only too unbearable , its point is clear about halfway through . We get the point after the first half hour or so : hope is gone , life is awful , okay , okay , got it . Here is an equal indictment of the vapidity , moral bankruptcy and violence slathering modern society . Strives for political points while it 's whiffing on simplicities like character , motivation , and believability . The whole film seems to keel over at the end , weary and debilitated by the savagery it chronicles . But the urgency and sadness resound in its wake . Rough , breathless adaptation of Fernando Vallejo 's ferociously sardonic novel . Like most of [ Schroeder 's ] work , it 's thoughtful and well-made , and the performances are polished and totally believable . Both hilariously deadpan and hopelessly sad . 	Director Barbet Schroeder presents a bleak , darkly humorous drama about hopeless love in Medellin , Colombia .
computer chess 2013 The film is likely to confound viewers , but it 's also a bizarre and fascinating retrograde portrait of an eccentric people and a faraway time . Computer Chess may seem like a novelty item , but it 's that and more , accumulating insight and substance without ever losing the fun of being a lark . It becomes something that 's hard to decipher ; hard to put into words in a review . That 's a good thing . The spirit of Altman returns ! A film to study , pick apart , discuss and debate . Entirely original and unprecedented -- a formalist coup that is at once visionary and retro , thoughtful and hilarious . I really do n't know what to think of this movie . It did not do much for me . It was neither interesting nor compelling . A number of ideas are brought up , but I could not see that they go anywhere . Dryly humorous and wonderfully weird , this is a preternaturally mundane evocation of early 80s nerdery and an almost scary peek at the history of AI . This black and white , academically formatted comedy is like a retro , existential soap opera where nerds already puzzling out the machine vs. human paradox are totally flummoxed by a group of outwardly sexual new agers . It 's the type of film that introduces a type of funny that you did n't know existed , that is n't based in popular culture or punchlines or pratfalls or virtually anything that we 've seen before . Bujalski is n't playing at Christopher Guest-like caricature . Instead of mocking this eccentric group , he climbs right inside their anxieties and ambitions . 	With its delightfully retro production design , Computer Chess is an inventive , intelligent , and humorous comedy that celebrates the eccentricity and uniqueness of its subject .
prestige The PrestigeH is infused with faux intellectualism -- it pretends to be more cerebral than it really is , when all it really wants to do is be the new Sixth Sense . It will have you talking on the way out of the theatre and maybe thinking about that one glaring error in logic , but it 's like an illusion , if you think about it too much , it will spoil the magic . The Prestige retains a mesmerizing hold on the audience , and it returns magic to the realm of the real , where craftsmanship and stage presence are just as thrilling as the physical act of disappearance . Visually spry and contemplative , what more can one say about a forceful film that asks us to unmask our hidden Houdini within ? Hey , it 's just plain magic ! Until an inexplicably awful revelation at the end , The Prestige is a taut , exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians . Watching Bowie as Thomas Edison 's archenemy Nikola Tesla , you wish the role ( a glorified cameo ) were more integral to the story . If you can forgive some woeful casting and a plot that is as creakingly thin as an old staircase , you can enjoy director Christopher Nolan 's The Prestige . It is good for magic to be , in effect , confounding . It is not so good for a movie about magic to be confusing . The elegant contours of The Illusionist are even more impressive compared with Christopher Nolan 's clutter of double and triple crosses in The Prestige . Parts of the film really stand out , but taken as a whole , it 's a labyrinth of conflicting ideas . 	Full of twists and turns , The Prestige is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience .
just my luck Everything that might have made it a quality romantic comedy has been tainted by ridiculous teen marketing . ... a variation on Freaky Friday buffed with a bit of 13 Going on 30 's yuppie-career-princess gloss . Is this movie actively hoping people will hate it for being so stupid ? ... never quite recovers from the way Lohan bops around with an air of celebrity entitlement . It 's difficult to say whether [ Lohan 's character ] is more grating when she 's cursed and whiny or when she 's blessed and oblivious . A totally predictable and competently made feelgood fantasy flick for females under 30 . If you want an escape and rest your brain , try your luck Just My Luck is a safe teen movie that teens will actually like , and there are far worse things than that . The real rot is in the script . It 's very difficult not to get on board with this quirky comedy . t 's not like Lindsay Lohan is down on her luck . But she 'd be more fortunate -- at least if she wants to be considered as a serious actress -- if she 'd appear in movies of a higher quality than `` Just My Luck , '' a by-the-numbers teen-type romantic comedy . 	Just My Luck is a screwball rom-com that fails to take advantage of Lindsay Lohan 's considerable charm . The film ( along with Robert Altman 's A Prairie Home Companion ) marks the end of Lohan 's teen queen phase as she begins playing characters that are older , but not necessarily wiser . Lohan 's character is supposedly cursed with bad luck , though the movie confuses misfortune with plain stupidity , leading Lohan into a long series of silly and senseless physical gags .
frankenweenie 2012 A movie full of laughs and some scares , but it works because it is full of true love and heart . To witness Burton 's talent , heart and spirit working in unison to create a fine movie is a special treat that should not be taken for granted . Might not be quite the jolt that Burton 's work needs , but it 's at least a step in the right direction . As energetic children 's entertainment with a twist it works fine , but Frankenweenie has the elements to go further before it settles for something that feels too familiar . Burton has made a highly affectionate bit of ghoulishness . This 3-D , black-and-white `` family '' comedy is the year 's most inventive , endearing animated feature . There are so many horror auteurs Burton wants to thank that the film is absolutely bursting at the seams with knowing nods . Ultimately , any misgivings are far from grave ... and animation lovers will certainly rest in peace . Filled with nice and imaginative touches for monster movie buffs , 'Frankenweenie ' might be stitched together from many sources , but it mostly holds together for its nearly 90 minutes up on the screen . ( Full Content Review for Parents also available ) It works well enough as a left-of-center family movie . 	Frankenweenie is an energetic stop-motion horror movie spoof with lovingly crafted visuals and a heartfelt , oddball story .
1093579-man on the moon Whether you like the film will probably depend on whether you thought Kaufman was funny the first time . Maybe Forman and the writers were paralyzed by the thought that Andy might , true to tabloid rumor , still be alive . It would be great if he did turn up on TV , pop his eyes and , in his Latka voice , call the movie a mistake . Even if you never knew or cared much about Kaufman , you may be drawn into his world through this fictionalized biography . `` Thank you very much . '' Man on the Moon does n't really try to get to the bottom of the sadness in Kaufman ; it takes his desperation for granted and milks it for sniffles . Not everyone knows Andy Kaufman , but the world knows Jim Carrey . Soon it will know more about Kaufman 's unique style of humor . This is less of a biography than it is a series of reenactments . Uninspired and relatively clueless . Entertaining . A mesmerizing tale sure to thrill devotees of Kaufman 's brand of off-kilter stunt humor . 	Jim Carrey is eerily dead-on in his portrayal of Andy Kaufman , which helps to elevate Man on the Moon above the script 's formulaic biopic cliches .
house bunny Fans of comedies like Legally Blonde and Mean Girls should get a kick out of Anna Faris ' amusing starring vehicle , even if this one is n't quite as sly or slickly produced . The House Bunny stays simplistic just like Legally Blonde . Anna Faris deserves better . While The House Bunny is sure to appeal more to the female demographic , at least the guys who get dragged into watching this particular chick flick by their dates can feel solace in knowing that it could be a whole lot worse . It is all so cheesy , The Sneak almost felt like not wanting to be a film critic anymore . The purpose of this comedy is to serve as a showcase for Anna Faris , whose sunny disposition and solid comic timing make The House Bunny more enjoyable than it ought to be . For something that looked as potentially stupid as it did in the trailers , you 'll be laughing a heck of a lot . Factory made , nothing new ... and really funny . It 's computer-written stuff , stiffly directed by first-timer Fred Wolf , but it 's light and fun and sports a decent quota of passable gags . The film 's only noteworthy features prove to be the scenes inside the Playboy mansion , where a wrinkled Hugh Hefner shows up , doing his weary best to put in a credible performance as himself . This film from the Adam Sandler fun factory starts with a series of obnoxious , dated stereotypes , and never quite flips them into something positive . 	Anna Faris is game , but she ca n't salvage this middling , formulaic comedy .
blind spot hitlers secretary Because it is all monologue , the film has the effect of a casual lecturer 's going on for 90 minutes . But what a lecturer and what a 90 minutes ! The film does illuminate its subject , which is not Hitler himself , who remains a fairly unfathomable figure , but Traudl Junge . An historical document , not for the novelty of its revelations , but for the fact that it may be the last insider testimony of the fall of the Third Reich . Both mesmerizing and disquieting . So many questions have long been left unanswered , and Blind Spot does little to change that . Although it has a stripped-down , cinema verite simplicity that suggests unrehearsed spontaneity ... the compulsively fascinating Blind Spot : Hitler 's Secretary also has the quality of a near-operatic epic performance . Junge 's testimony is a salutary reminder that [ Hitler ] was like other people in ways , and that the evil he manifested could visit us again if more civilized humans do n't remain watchful . Traudl Junge tells interesting stories , but unless you 're a historian that has been waiting to hear her version of Hitler 's days in office , this would be just as effective if you wait to see it on the small screen . This is a straightforward , dead-ahead documentary ... but nonetheless it builds to a poignant , extreme and terminal climax that shoots off the celluloid right into our guts , piercing our sense of history and humanity . Which is more fascinating -- the personification of evil or the humble creature who innocently served him ? 	The testimony of Junge is more than enough to make this bare-bones documentary fascinating .
open season High energy and lively performances keep this animated film entertaining , even if there 's nothing terribly original about it . Somebody ought to declare open season on these copycat movies , but in the meantime , you could do a lot worse than this bright-looking , lightly amusing excursion from the Sony 's Imageworks CG division . In Open Season , the bad guys are such caricatures that there 's just never any doubt as to the outcome . A fun story thanks to animals going 'wild ' in a convenience store , cagey squirrels , and the wacky things you can do with rabbits . If it 's open season on laughs , this movie bags almost the limit . Within its limitations , Open Season could hardly be better , generating real interest and audience sympathy . And the storyline carries built-in intrigue . Periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery cant disguise that this is just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say . The talking animal movie has become a worse Hollywood clich than the buddy cop movie . For a while , they were just remaking The Lion King over and over . Now they 're remaking Ice Age . Animated children 's movies should not glamorize criminal activity and war , but that 's exactly what happens in `` Open Season '' ... If you get a chance to see the film in 3-D IMAX , the letter grade goes up a few notches , as the experience of having a giant screen full of Froot Loops flying right at you is the birthright of every American . [ T ] his is as fresh , as clever , as lively , as huggable , as satisfying as animated movies get . 	Open Season is a cliched palette of tired jokes and CG animal shenanigans that have been seen multiple times this cinematic year .
1016240-phantom of the opera Like that other creaky Universal monster epic , Dracula , The Phantom of the Opera is one of those classic films whose reputation trumps its actual cinematic worth . A pinnacle of the Hollywood fantastic . An eerie mixture of poetry , gothic melodrama and a surreal Feuillade-style serial . If it was n't quite the match of the fright fests that were being made over in Europe during this decade ( Nosferatu , The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ) , it was certainly one of the most epic American undertakings this side of D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille . The Phantom of the Opera belongs in the collection of any serious horror film buff . Lon Chaney delivers an awesome performance in this fine adaptation of the original Gaston Leroux novel . Kerry is a colorless hero , Philbin contents herself with being pretty and becoming terrorized at the Phantom , and Chaney is either behind a mask or grimacing through his fiendish makeup . The original 1925 version of The Phantom of the Opera gets a touch-up with a modern Goth-inspired soundtrack from the band Switchblade Symphony . Lon Chaney 's performance as the hideous organist prowling the sewers beneath the Paris Opera is still a cornerstone of gothic horror . Its moody sets and murky patterns of shadows and light helped to set a high standard for horror films 	Decades later , it still retains its ability to scare -- and Lon Chaney 's performance remains one of the benchmarks of the horror genre .
lannee derniere a marienbad 1961 The beautiful last gasp of black-and-white cinematography The recurring attitude throughout most interpretations of Marienbad is that of sheer interpretation fatigue . Exquisite . Cold and aloof , this is also a strangely haunting movie experience . The mystery all film lovers eventually must grapple with . Leading the viewer up more than one garden path and forever haunting the corridors of the mind , this perplexing enigma is a labyrinth of chillingly perfect construction . A true landmark in film history . I 've always found it romantic and sexy , full of yearning and mystery . Its one of the greatest films ever made , and an experience unrivaled in cinema . Fascinating , perplexing and infuriating in equal measure , this spectacular example of dreamlike filmmaking deserves to be approached with an open -- or opened -- mind . Every aspect is ambiguous , but the rewards are there . 	Elegantly enigmatic and dreamlike , this work of essential cinema features exquisite cinematography and an exploration of narrative still revisited by filmmakers today .
oceans eleven If you ever saw a heist film before , this one has nothing new to add . Clooney and Pitt have more onscreen chemistry than most celluloid lovers . Sharp , witty dialogue snappily delivered . Suffice to say , Ocean 's 11 is a safe bet on which you can place your chips on . A playful romp without much oomph or zest . It 's the kind of movie you really like , but not as much as you want to . A sure bet . Fun heist movie for older kids and their families . It 's a kick , it 's a gas , and it gives the Rat Pack itself a run for its money . It rarely shows you anything you have n't seen in comparable pictures , and has no layer of depth to its coolness 	As fast-paced , witty , and entertaining as it is star-studded and coolly stylish , Ocean 's Eleven offers a well-seasoned serving of popcorn entertainment .
nascar the imax experience A 45-minute glorified infomercial . IMAX and NASCAR have to be one of the most harmonious match-ups since Elvis and a guitar . An uneven combination of documentary and demolition drama . True fans ( i.e. , the people who are most likely to buy tickets ) probably know a lot of this stuff already , and they might be disappointed by the lack of drama and the brevity of 3-D racing action . Does n't quite overcome its shameless self-promotion , but the film will satisfy the Lynyrd Skynyrd set while providing a decent explanation to those who are baffled by the sport 's popularity .

10009192-21 `` We 're not gambling ... we 're counting , '' says Kevin Spacey in the new Las Vegas tale 21 , which is a very appropriate way to sum up the film itself . 21 is a fast-paced tale that makes winning look not only easy , but a lot of fun . ... it seems they used Film Adaptations for Dummies and thus missed an opportunity to make a great movie with style and atmosphere . ... the film quickly devolves into an interminable mess of hoary cliches and stale conventions ( a trying-on-clothes montage ? Really ? ) It 's funny how movies based on real stories can be the most formulaic and predictable . Although it 's definitely a fictionalization of a true story , they get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas . If only director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb had not opted for glitz . As filmmakers , they 're playing for very low stakes . It may take a rocket scientist to successfully count cards , but not to wite a smarter script than what 21 delivers . Fun and nothing else , but enough so that it 's worth the while . None of the main stars is remotely convincing as a smart person . 	21 could have been a fascinating study had it not supplanted the true story on which it is based with mundane melodrama .
aliens of the deep Visually , this is another leap for 3D and robotic cameras . Here we know only that Cameron and his bright-eyed young scientists ( who take turns narrating ) are heading to the deeper parts of the Atlantic and Pacific to observe the environment and life-forms down there . Cameron and his crew have captured mesmerizing footage . Often thrilling . Yes , the work they 're doing is mind-boggling and important , but sometimes the images alone are more than capable of speaking for themselves . There are impressive rock formations and many other fine things to see , along with an interesting science lesson . A fascinating science lesson for anyone interested in either deep-sea -- or outer space -- exploration . Though only 48 minutes long and the 3-D effects are sometimes stunning , it has substantial passages that are curiously dull ... ca n't hold a candle to Cameron 's other 'Aliens . ' Beyond a doubt the biggest movie ever made about shrimp , Aliens of the Deep is a technical marvel that still manages to fall somewhere severely south of marvelous . Puts some of these incredible creatures right in our laps . And we do n't even need to travel hundreds of light years to see them . 	An amazing array of images from beneath the sea .
my best friends wedding Everett is very charming . There are many humorous moments throughout , though some of the more outrageous segments seem too contrivedly wacky . This delightful comedy about love , friendship and the hazards of lying comes not a moment too soon for anyone overwhelmed by the current glut of summer movie mayhem . Not only does this modern-day screwball romp manage to be romantic and comical , it also offers Julia Roberts a chance to shine again in the kind of movie that she does best . My Best Friend 's Wedding has a bit of an edge and enough intelligence to keep it from drowning in the kind of mawkish sentimentality that often makes this sort of movie hard-to-swallow . Emotionally , this is a movie that just does n't compute . You leave feeling cross , as if you 've been tricked . Roberts , despite being required to fall through doors and tumble from chairs more often than is truly necessary , handles the material with exactly the right level of skill and charm . [ An ] obtuse , prettily decorative comedy . What I found unbelievable and unable to forgive , much of what the audiences were blindly exculpatory to , was the wicked , insideousness of Julia Roberts ' character . One of the things that makes My Best Friend 's Wedding such a terrific romantic comedy is that it refuses to play it safe . 	Thanks to a charming performance from Julia Roberts and a subversive spin on the genre , My Best Friend 's Wedding is a refreshingly entertaining romantic comedy .
10007415-amazing grace A well-told cinematic example of a man who used his faith and God-given opportunities to change the world for good . Do n't shy away for fear of a dry bit of educational cinema ; Amazing Grace is a well-told and very human story . Accessibility is one of the movie 's virtues : without dumbing down , it makes the workings of Parliament seem as gripping as a good suspense thriller . History purists will find the details enchanting , period drama fanatics will adore the arm's-length posture of the piece , and the true-life tale is one worth being told . Just make sure to ingest loads of caffeine before watching . Director Michael Apted and screenwriter Steven Knight ca n't help letting a little sanctification take hold -- while also , sadly , making a charged historical subject seem tedious . I 'm not sure what was a bigger problem for me , though -- that the story jumped around so much , or that the tone did , too . Amazing Grace 's examination of men in power moved to change risks ridicule and righteousness for a smart take on history . The rhetoric in the film is clearly intended to be relevant to the situation in the United States today ... 'Our fear of an unknown enemy must not be allowed to erode our long-cherished liberties , ' says a Wilberforce ally . A workmanlike costumer that distills Blighty 's long battle for the abolition of slavery and the personalities behind landmark antislavery legislation into a tidy story of conscience and perseverance . Amazing Grace marks an unforgettable and regrettable time in world history while highlighting a few who valiantly set out to right the wrongs . 	Amazing Grace is your quintessential historical biopic : stately , noble , and with plenty of electrifying performances .
snatch You 'll laugh and have a good old rowdy time watching Snatch . But as soon as you walk out of the theater , you 'll ask yourself what it was you were laughing at . It was probably a lot of fun to make , but it really does n't add anything to the genre , and it 's not really a development over his first film . Two hours of creative chaos , all exuberant visuals and wonderful dialogue from people with names like Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris The Blade . Snatch , while somewhat hard to follow , represents a fascinating study in character interaction and complex plot development . Bouncing around in a world of bare-knuckle boxing , gypsy swindlers , pretend Jewish diamond merchants , indestructible Russian assassins and a thug who disposes of bodies by feeding them to hungry pigs , Snatch has enough plots for a fair-sized cemetery . This may be one of the hazardous offshoots of the music-video-trained generation of moviemakers ; they confuse a diet of eye candy with a full meal . May the postmodern gangster archetype stay around for years to come -- as long as they stay as original , as funny , and as fascinating as the rogues ' gallery in Snatch . Como diretor , Guy Ritchie parece estar se divertindo durante todo o filme . Terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot . Fun moments are ultimately slight compensation for Snatch 's overall staleness . 	Though perhaps a case of style over substance , Guy Ritchie 's second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue , dark comedy , and interesting characters .
brand upon the brain Welcome to the Spectacle of the Summer ! Brand may not be as satisfying as The Heart of the World or Dracula : Pages From a Virgin 's Diary , but it 's the first to suggest a dead-serious Maddin film may not be a bad thing . Succeeds at one and the same time in functioning as both a celebration and a deconstruction of the conscious and unconscious glories of silent movies through the barely 30 years of their existence at the beginning of the 20th century . It is almost an unintended parody of the excesses of art house filmmaking - like something that would have shown up on Dan Akroyd 's old Saturday Night Live vignette `` Bad Cinema . '' A typically spastic , experimental mix of old-fashioned movie effects and overheated Freudian melodrama . Prepare to have your mind blown . It would n't be unfair to say one Maddin film is strikingly similar to another . The deliciously unhinged Guy Maddin makes films that are funny , sinister and mysterious at the same time . [ Maddin ] taps a rich vein in this highly memorable and frequently disturbing homage to lost innocence and German expressionism . A surprisingly frightening and affecting film , launching itself from vertiginous peaks into shadowy hollows . 	A bizarre , compelling spectacle that invests its absurd plot with heartfelt sincerety , Brand Upon the Brain ! is a unique cinematic experience .
kiss kiss bang bang Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang could be construed as a kind of oblique mea culpa , but Black is having too much fun to seem all that apologetic . ... awfully entertaining ... A postmodern pastiche for those who like the artifice of motion pictures and the sleazy side of America exposed with a smile . This movie is a classic already - you 'll be quoting it and referencing it as soon as you have walked out of the theater . Black 's retro-noir reminds us why we love movies : because they can surprise us , even when we 're ankle deep in bullet casings , bodies and enough twists to tie us in knots . A true comeback for Black and stars Downey and Kilmer , Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang is smart smart , fun fun . [ A ] smart , hilarious blend of detective story and action film , relishing the viciously twisting plot and the chance to take sarcastic swipes at life in superficial Los Angeles . Even if it does n't necessarily hold together as a coherent narrative and its mystery only makes a little sense , Kiss Kiss is a tremendously entertaining trip . A modernized frat-boy version of Chinatown ... and I mean that in a good way . If you 've seen your share of action flicks ( who has n't ? ) you should have no trouble chuckling . And nodding and winking . 	Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark , eclectic neo-noir homage .
maria full of grace Maria is no saint , but she is full of grace and her movie 's divine . Marston 's strikingly confident debut maintains an unblinking focus and sustains an almost unbearable level of tension . The story is told in a lean , clean way , with no missteps . Whatever its flaws , Maria Full of Grace is a daunting debut work well worth catching . through both Marston 's and Moreno 's refusal to play up her pain or struggles , we care even more about how her believable tale will end . Colombian director Joshua Marston knows that direct , immediate suspense is the key to making the audience share the ordeal of his heroine who works as a drug mule . Maria Full of Grace is an extraordinary experience for many reasons , including , oddly , its willingness to be ordinary . Throughout , we 're constantly rooting for Maria , aware of her underlying decency and protective of her missteps . Marston , making his directorial debut , made some choices while creating his film that simply can not be described more accurately than as ballsy . One of those films that finds strength in its directness , that passes up the fireworks and cheap tricks and just goes straight for the starkness of a powerful situation . 	In a striking debut , Moreno carries the movie and puts a human face on the drug trade .
garfield I do n't know who had the idea that Bill Murray would be the right actor to do Garfield 's voice , but the casting is inspired . This Garfield is everything Jim Davis ' eponymous cartoon is n't ... The result is not so much catnip as catnap . Though Garfield runs barely 80 minutes , it seems a good hour of it involves chases , furniture and luggage collapsing , and grown-up actors madly mugging . Apart from the under-seven set , it 's hard to imagine anyone not being agonizingly wearied by the interminable cascade of lowbrow slapstick and Rube Goldberg set pieces . This Garfield does n't even look like the Garfield we know , love and used to have smashed on our car windows with suction cups . Garfield remains one of the most shamelessly marketed properties of all time , so the inevitable feature film is merely the logical climax to a product blitz that already includes bowling balls , oven mitts , and a line of Richard Petty-related products . The problem is that there is n't a comic series less appropriate for a movie adaptation than Garfield , and I say this as a longtime fan of the strip . It has good laughs , decent writing and is 100 % loyal to both the comic and the cartoon , which will leave the diehard fans begging for more . A delightful feline festival . 	When the novelty of the CGI Garfield wears off , what 's left is a simplistic kiddie movie .
borat The most important thing to know about BORAT is that you will be appalled by what you see , and then you will be appalled by the way it makes you laugh . Uproariously . And with wild abandon . All you think while you 're watching is how could people be so amusingly stupid , and why ca n't I quit laughing at the sight of two naked men wrestling ? The movie 's twist is whether we should pity those real-life Americans tricked by Cohen , who is Jewish , into revealing some rather telling sides of themselves . Cohen 's comic genius is remarkable because most of what he does is improvisation . The jokes hit hard and almost too often making your own laughter serve as earplugs for half of the film . This already controversial 'mockumentary ' contains more laugh-out-loud moments than any film since last year 's comedy hit The 40 Year Old Virgin . Borat 's cultural learning is revealing , even if it does n't adequately convey how it benefits glorious nation of Kazakhstan . ... one of the funniest films in years and surely the most laugh-provoking . Face it , Borat is the funniest movie ever made . [ Baron ] Cohen melds the pranking of `` Jackass , '' the punking of `` Punk 'd , '' the satire of Matt Stone and Trey Parker , and the inventiveness of Mel Brooks to create an original brand of comedy that stands alone as a defiant manifesto for compulsive laughs . 	Jagshemash ! Borat gets high-fives almost all-around for being offensive in the funniest possible way . Part satire , part shockumentary , Borat stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the gleefully sexist , homophobic , and anti-Semitic title character on a cross-country trek to learn more about our strange nation ; along the way he dredges up the seamy underbelly of American prejudice and ignorance . Now the cat is out of the bag , what will Cohen do for an encore ?
taxi to the dark side despite the calmly logical way in which it allows its revelations to unfold and accumulate , this is an angry powder-keg of a film , exploding the reactionary myth that under certain circumstances torture can be acceptable , serviceable or even necessary . Gibney 's film proves a cogent document that people need to see because there seems to be a willingness to accept the current policies without really thinking about what that means ... Gibney 's film asks us to think and to question . A consistently strong piece of filmmaking with some breathtaking work by cinematographers Maryse Alberti and Greg Andracke . Impossible to shake off . For those willing to go along for the ride , it is a harrowing experience , as Gibney makes his case that the United States , in its haste to retaliate for the atrocities of 9/11 , has itself crossed a bloody line in the sand . Taxi To the Dark Side , ranks among the best and most devastating entries , a scathing indictment of government-sanctioned torture . Consciously depressing , draining and damning . A dizzying , disorienting tone befits indictments against vulgarly abused power , and Gibney avoids judging soldiers already punished in accordance with a system of blame shamefully traveling down , never up . So disturbing , on so many levels , that it 's hard to know where to begin . Powerful , shocking and important documentary that confirms all your worst fears about the Bush administration and will leave you feeling angry and powerless . [ Director ] Gibney has crafted more than just an important document of systemic abuse -- he 's stripped the rhetoric from official doublespeak to expose a callous disregard for not only the Geneva Conventions but the vision of the Founding Fathers . 	Taxi to the Dark Side is an intelligent , powerful look into the dark corners of the War on Terror .
dangerous lives of altar boys A soggy coming-of-age drama , one loaded with a single fresh conceit and plenty of tired , wheezing ones . Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment Too dark for teens ; too far into the comic vision for adults . Foster and newcomer Hirsch are the best things in Dangerous Lives , a touching but odd mix of live action and animation . Devious , delinquent , and diverting . [ The ] animated sequences , candy-colored and typically comic-booky over the top , only underscore , by stark contrast , the film 's unvarnished depiction of teenage life as hard , confusing , and awkward . A sensitive and originally executed film . A coming-of-age story handled with an unusual amount of integrity and sensitivity . While it 's true that there 's little about Altar Boys that 's inept , there 's even less about it that 's genuinely interesting . The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is a magical mix of live action drama and animated adventure . 	The inter-cutting of animation by Spawn 's creator , Todd McFarlane , does n't always work , but the performances by the young actors capture the pains of growing up well .
the lego movie ... let 's not pave all the roads with yellow bricks just yet . [ The Lego Movie hits ] the sweet spot between adults who grew up with Lego and children who love Lego , and carefully ignoring the irony of such an overtly branded indictment of corporate strangulation of creativity . Commercially speaking , it needed only to be fun , colorful and brisk . But in Lord and Miller 's hands , it 's affecting , empowering and transcendent , proving that you can work within the boundaries of the familiar to craft something truly exceptional . Often clever and erudite ... Unfortunately , that visual imagination is often negated by the filmmaker 's failure to realize that every story has an appropriate length . Funny , inventive and bound to boost sales of the interlocking plastic bricklets even further . Kids , this is what drugs are like . The LEGO Movie is about creativity and how it resides inside each and every one of us . Round the kids up ( or do n't ) , plop yourself down in a theater ( no need to pay extra for 3D ) and get ready to remember how great it was to open a box of random LEGO parts and find the world was just full of blocky possibilities of where to go next . The problem is that the plot is simplistic , the jokes are n't very funny , and if you 're not a Lego aficionado you may be wondering what the fuss is all about . Much of the time it makes other movies based on toys look like child 's play . 	Boasting beautiful animation , a charming voice cast , laugh-a-minute gags , and a surprisingly thoughtful story , The Lego Movie is colorful fun for all ages .
insidious About as subtle as a fart at a sance Insidious is happy enough with elevating your breathing pattern every now and then , as opposed to choking you outright with one shock after another . Promising and , in places , highly effective , this haunted-house variant more than fulfils its Friday Night fright flick duties but could have pushed through to a whole new plane . There 's nothing wrong with its standard set up which has an unsuspecting family haunted by spirits . However , when it comes time for the film to follow through on the plotline , we find out the filmmakers were n't quite up to the task . Like the ghouls and ghosties confronted by its characters , Insidious overstays its welcome . Saw creators Whannell and Wan return with a horror movie creepy enough to borrow under your skin . Not so much insidious as inexcusable . The jump to more outr ghost-train-style horror is perhaps a tad blunt , but it remains scary enough to make it easy to buy into the supernatural ride it 's intent on taking you on . It may be an essentially shallow ride , but it will make you scared of the dark again . It is a strangely comforting to be reminded of what that feels like . Good for a handful of jumps and guilty giggles before it quickly reaches for the slipshod , hokey contrivances you do n't expect until number 2 or 3 in the franchise . 	Aside from a shaky final act , Insidious is a very scary and very fun haunted house thrill ride .
excalibur Perhaps the best-ever filmed version of the Arthurian legend . It 's like an excruciating Renaissance festival in a drug fog . Excessive but occasionally inspired , Excalibur gives us grimy lumbering knights , gloomy castles , slithering dragons , mesmerizing magic , and ( of course ) the struggle between good and evil . The film is kind of simple in its plotting , but what 's cool is the design . Mr. Boorman takes these myths very seriously , but he has used them with a pretentiousness that obscures his vision . The result is almost always the handsomest of films to behold . Storywise it has its moments , too , although it never quite achieves the difficult blend of grandeur and madness for which it strives . So far the most honest and most powerful on-screen depiction of the ancient and universal legend . There is humor here ( in the form of a vaudeville Merlin , played by Nicol Williamson ) as well as a diminution of scale that seems intended to help audiences through the thornier byways of Boorman 's vision . Somehow it combines legendary material both visually and audibly that hooks me every time . ... romantic and brutal , lyrically beautiful yet grittily realistic . 	John Boorman 's operatic , opulent take on the legend of King Arthur is visually remarkable , and features strong performances from an all-star lineup of British thespians .
saw VI Saw movies and Halloween go together like ho and hum . This script , by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton , has a more lyrical bent , and a more satiric bite , than any of the other Saw sequels . Michael Moore would have a field day with this latest installment , where the writers tackle the health care system with Jigsaw as an answer . The latest installment of the movie franchise is as customer-service-oriented as ever . If you have n't followed the series up until now , there 's not much point in trying to catch up . New director Kevin Greutert does something just a little bit different , and more daring , with the level of tension and the payoffs . Saw VI is the sixth Saw I 've seen , and maybe the sickest . The never-ending Saw horror franchise continues . Sigh . Fans and non-fans will get exactly what they expect , and not much more . Saw VI 's story is now so ugly and bent out of shape , it 's impossible to follow - more fool you for trying . They keep reviving dead characters to keep the poor excuse for a story going . When will it all end ? Jigsaw is dead , everyone 's dead . Please make it stop ! Paul Chambers , CNN . 	It wo n't earn the franchise many new fans , but Saw VI is a surprising step up for what has become an intricately grisly annual tradition .
rocky iv ... suffers from a vibe of superfluousness ... Film reduced to the barest of three acts . A camp classic , funny for all the wrong reasons . Ridiculous jingoistic nonsense . Should have stopped at three . Four , no more . Cold War metaphors delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer dampens the storytelling . This is grim and witless storytelling , and what makes it so depressing is that it has n't improved by so much as a chemical trace since the days of the first Rocky . Fist-pumping , heart-jumping , chest-thumping fun . Even the hint of political power that Rocky garners by the end of this latest battle is made to seem like more of the same empty glory . ( No quote available . ) 	Rocky IV inflates the action to absurd heights , but it ultimately rings hollow thanks to a story that hits the same basic beats as the first three entries in the franchise .
antman A formidable character with high stakes and global consequences , partly by rooting it firmly in a post-Avengers world . Clunky and strange but refreshingly simple . Pretending there 's a more fascinating version of this film out there somewhere , like the Richard Donner cut of Superman II , is a great way to come to terms with how rote and unremarkable Ant-Man is . When your most memorable character turns out to be Thomas the Tank Engine , featured in two hilarious scenes , you know your picture about a tiny superhero has big , big problems . Fast-paced , character-based , and appreciably energetic . This is a film that never loses sight of its title character , even when that character literally falls between the cracks . The plot 's the same old thing . Mad , mad , mad , mad science ; imminent apocalypse ; parent/child issues ; blah blah blaggidy blah . The tone of Ant-Man , however , is relatively light and predominantly comic . The Ant-Man movie is nonstop exposition up until the third act , so about 90 minutes . What fan of anything would want a whole movie explaining how it works ? You want to see it in action , not spend the whole movie trying to convince nonbelievers . The movie 's almost self-deprecatory sense of tongue-in-cheek humility is matched by the fact that all the pleasures it affords are very small indeed . It could have been a lot worse and that in itself is a small miracle . 	Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd , Ant-Man offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale -- albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors .
whats love got to do with it Though the picture rightfully belongs to Bassett , a final word must be said about Fishburne , who never fails to make Ike seem human if not defensible . Even in defeat , he is remarkably compelling . Basset genuinely holds your sympathy as the little country girl Anna Mae Bullock , singing and suffering her way to superstardom and personal liberation , [ and ] Fishburne is sensational . Fishburne 's astonishing portrayal of Ike is what holds the movie together . The actor builds , in precise increments , a devastating portrait of a macho control freak ; he even finds a kind of ghastly humor in the character 's madness . Incendiary performances by Fishburne and Bassett . Angela Bassett gives a superbly versatile performance as the heroine , and Laurence Fishburne 's portrayal of Ike Turner consolidates his status as one of the most expressive and intelligent actors in movies today . A splashy , volatile , crowd- pleasing rock-star melodrama that makes up in sheer emotional wallop what it sometimes lacks in finesse . Both stars deserved their Oscar nominations for virtually carrying a picture that looks and sounds great , but is a little oversimplified dramatically . Angela Bassett shakes her tail feather with aplomb and pins down the singer 's gestures with amazing precision . Top honours , however , belong to Fishburne 's swaggering , savage portrayal of Ike . Powerful , troubling and ultimately inspiring . This biography of rock diva Tina Turner 's turbulent life is filled with energetic musical numbers and emotionally charged moments , all anchored by two outstanding lead performances . 	With a fascinating real-life story and powerhouse performances from Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne , What 's Love Got to Do With It ? is a ca n't miss biopic .
i am love Sumptuous , overheated , and ridiculous , Love is a visual delight -- the opening montage of a snowy Milan alone make it worthwhile `` I Am Love '' is undeniably soap opera , especially when it takes an operatic third-act turn , but it is soap opera of a high order . Tilda Swinton could rivet us by reading the telephone book . It 's a bold experiment rooted in tradition . It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama . Tilda Swinton gives an intelligent , compelling performance that elevates this sumptuously mounted European art film way above its melodramatic trappings . Tilda Swinton unleashes her diva and Italian cinema gets a powerful new voice in this operatic melodrama . It 's melodramatic stuff , but it 's beautifully filmed and Swinton is outstanding . Swinton is incredible . full review at Movies for the Masses The movie is n't flawless -- a bizarre post-credits bit is nigh-impossible to make out -- but [ Guadagnino 's ] skill with visual poetry makes a strong impression . 	It stumbles into melodrama , but I Am Love backs up its flamboyance with tremendous visual style and a marvelous central performance from Tilda Swinton .
1053779-mask Depends entirely on your tolerance for Carrey . A wacky and eye-popping ( literally ) combination of live-action comedy and computer animation . A wild movie and a dazzling debut by Cameron Diaz Though the story has a certain universal appeal -- who has n't felt like a useless jerk and wished to wake up capable of anything ? -- the execution is oddly sour and distasteful . Carrey was born to play this role ! You 're kidding ? You mean Carrey had assistance from CG ? Man , I thought that was all just him . Though a bit slow in the in-betweens ( you might get a somewhat antsy ) , The Mask is a cute clean film for the whole family . The Mask would be a loud dud without Jim Carrey 's unique talents . Adroitly directed , viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun . The Mask is highly enjoyable -- if you can bear Carrey 's constant tics and mugging . 	It misses perhaps as often as it hits , but Jim Carrey 's manic bombast , Cameron Diaz ' blowsy appeal , and the film 's overall cartoony bombast keep The Mask afloat .
lost boys It has n't aged well . At all . An exhilarating hybrid of horror and suburban comedy . It starts slow , but finishes fast with some clever plot twists . In the end , all is not lost with these boys . ... a passable yet unspectacular relic of the 1980s . A corn-ball '80s vampire classic ! Starring the two Corey 's ! A horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry . The Lost Boys , which attempts to be funny while preserving the shock value of the vampire legend , aims somewhat higher ... and misses . Southern California is n't exactly Transylvania , but the settings are effectively spooky . And there 's some amusing satire on the horror-pic genre . The plot is weak , though . Schumacher falls far short of the talent for pop wit that Joe Dante showed in Gremlins and The Howling . Joel Schumacher 's 1987 teen vampire flick is ageing well . Part of that is down to the sexy blend of bad lads , bloodsuckers , camp comedy and carnage , but the quality of the cast plays a huge part too . 	Flawed but eminently watchable , Joel Schumacher 's teen vampire thriller blends horror , humor , and plenty of visual style with standout performances from a cast full of young 1980s stars .
north country Contrived fantasy . Only in Hollywood could Harrelson get Theron 's nemesis to recant his inadmissably irrelevant tale on the stand with such meager questioning . In retrospect , the movie seems weaker than it did in the theater . For all its issue-related fist pumping , the movie is suffused with the tender and heartwarming story of a man coming to terms with the love for his only daughter . Calls on men to stand up with women against attitudes they 've allowed for too long . . . a well-crafted , often powerful film that usually refuses to follow Hollywood 's script . Minimizes the scope of [ the real plaintiff 's ] legal battles by placing them in a neatly tied package that resolves the way most courtroom dramas do . An emotionally-charged drama that showcases another top-notch performance from Theron Rewarding and sensitively rendered , the studio-produced North Country might revive a worthy subgenre last visited , in tarted-up fashion , by Erin Brockovich . [ Theron ] is the wounded heart of the film and helps carry some of the less successful material of the film on her shoulders . Director Niki Caro Whale Rider and screenwriter Michael Seitzman have crafted an old-fashioned story about sexual harassment that delivers the obvious message ... .without a shred of nuance or subtlety . Even when the film borders on melodrama in its final courtroom confrontations , Ms. Caro navigates the camera with skill . 	Though sometimes melodramatic and formulaic , North Country is nonetheless a rousing , powerful story of courage and humanity .
10011268-oceans Assumes a far more consistent depiction of the titular habitat . At least this one does n't feel like I just happened upon it flipping from the Food Network on my way to an episode of Ninja Warrior . Horseshoe crabs scuttle like possessed Nazi helmets and a school of fish morphs from dreidel to disco ball , as if choreographed by Busby Berkeley . Each amazing shot of marine life is as visually stunning as what preceded it , and lo and behold , we do n't need 3-D technology to enjoy it . The movie unpretentiously and effectively shows how our cultural , personal and environmental history not only shape us but affect our decisions . Despite the talents of Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud -- the Oscar-nominated duo behind Winged Migration , who once again contribute their amazing , in-the-midst-of photography -- the most striking thing about Oceans is its banality . Could the script have been less informative ? Could it have been more soporifically read than Pierce Brosnan 's rendition ? I do n't think so . The movie could -- should -- be a symphony , and it frequently makes excellent use of spare classical music . When Brosnan pipes up , he is as welcome as a car alarm . My new favorite freaky thing is the wack-eyed mantis shrimp , a testy little fellow who gets violently territorial with crabs loitering around his front door - as one learns to its grief . Get off my lawn , punk . Magnificent A visually stunning plunge into the life aquatic ; shame about the narration . 	Oceans adds another visually stunning chapter to the Disney Nature library .
die another day 'I say , ' said 10-year-old Jimmy Bond as he stepped into the glory of an English summer afternoon on Royal Albert Street in the village of Little Balderdash , 'what an absolutely corking day for an adventure ! ' With Pierce Brosnan combining the best of all the actors who came before him in the role , we have a worthy Bond to begin the journey into the next forty years . Die Another Day delivers pretty much everything you could comfortably expect from a Bond movie . There 's only so much ridiculousness the human mind can take , and director Lee Tamahori crosses that line by a good 20 minutes . You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . A nice new step toward changing Bond back into his older , tougher incarnations in a way that the audience wo n't revolt over . Not quite the birthday party we were expecting , but it 's a diverting enough spectacle . Dead-on in so many respects that it is difficult to dislike . 'Die Another Day 's ' special effects will make your eyes open so wide your contacts might fall out , but the spy caper is double-crossed by a stupid script littered with one-liners so dumb that 007 actually makes XXX ( Vin Diesel ) sound like he 's clever . Berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` Die Another Day '' one of the most entertaining Bonds in years 	Its action may be bit too over-the-top for some , but Die Another Day is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise 's earlier installments .
agent cody banks This Frankenfilm comes lumbering out of the laboratory of the Danish director Harald Zwart , any trace of personality surgically removed and replaced by a fully road-tested cliche . Teen spy tale is another success for young Frankie Muniz and is backed by a broad spectrum of unexpected talents . This movie is so wearying in its mediocrity , the inappropriate Ronica almost registers as dramatic relief . I said almost . A wasteful , if painless , diversion . The writing 's too adult in places and to 'childish ' in others . This makes the whole thing uneven and stupid . An amusing diversion . Muniz must carry this movie alone -- and he 's equal to the task . Se voc quer conhecer jovens espies que realmente meream sua ateno , as melhores opes ainda so os dois Pequenos Espies e o tenso Os Heris No Tm Idade . Kids attending Agent Cody Banks wo n't need candy . The film itself is a 90-minute sugar rush . Just too familiar and unimaginative to be anything more than a forgettable time-waster for undemanding family audiences . 	Should satisfy young teens , but offers nothing new for those who are familiar with the formula .
killing fields [ A ] gripping , intelligent , provocative drama . The best moments are the human ones , the conversations , the exchanges of trust , the waiting around , the sudden fear , the quick bursts of violence , the desperation . Ngor 's naturalistic and empathic portrayal of his character 's desperate fight for survival is the key to this film 's visceral power . A gripping romanticized and somewhat fictionalized adaptation of an eyewitness magazine piece by New York Times journalist Sidney Schanberg . The film 's overall thrust -- angry , intelligent , compassionate -- makes this producer Puttnam 's finest movie to date . The director , Roland Joffe , and his photographer , Chris Menges , capture all of this with a realism that has n't been so poetically convincing in a nondocumentary context since Gillo Pontecorvo 's Battle of Algiers . Without doubt one of the finest British films of the last 50 years . One of the great films from what proved to be a great year for cinema , The Killing Fields has n't lost any of its power over the ensuing 30 years . The screen is swamped by a bathetic , self-preening sententiousness . The movie is diffuse and wandering . It 's someone telling a long , interesting story who ca n't get to the point . 	Artfully composed , powerfully acted , and fueled by a powerful blend of anger and empathy , The Killing Fields is a career-defining triumph for director Roland Joff and a masterpiece of American cinema .
clerks 2 Clerks II will resonate with viewers in Smith 's age range ( mid-thirties ) in a way that goes beyond comedy . Though Clerks II is in color , the acting is just as amateurish and the directing just as awkward as the black-and-white original . Dawson gives the only competent performance , and only Becky and the abused donkey are sympathetic characters . Deliberately disgusting , scatological , profane and vulgar , which makes this critic a bit embarrassed to admit that he found himself frequently laughing out loud at such offensive and obscene material . Clerks II finds Smith up to the profane , raunchy , profoundly humanist mischief of which he alone is the master . Tasteless , toxic re-hash of the original Clerks II has at last put Kevin Smith on my radar . Smith is able to revert to his low-budget origins and strike a genuine sequel . Clerks II strikes its deepest chords when it appeals to the emotional security of a passionately provincial status quo . A tender , scabrous and very , very funny comedy that picks up 12 years after the original . The point of Clerks , either number , is talk -- speedy , competitive , clever banter that recalls , in its profane way , the rhythms of old Ben Hecht comedies . 	Clerks II dishes up much of the graphic humor and some of the insight that made the 1994 original a cult hit .
playtime Jacques Tati 's 1967 masterpiece still holds up as a feast of subtle sight gags , playful noise and , above all , visual wonders . One of those rare films that has earned a following through its architecture This film delivers exactly what its title promises . It 's a panoramic frenzy of elaborate sights and sound design . ... recreates a supposedly perfect metropolis and then watches as it comes undone by man 's inherent folly . With Playtime 's monumental decor and complex choreographed gags taking place simultaneously in a constantly mutating space , Tati explored the possibilities of 70mm as they had never been utilized before . At a time when most comedies seem created for knuckle-trailing sensibilities , we can use as much sophistication as we can get . Utterly unconventional and strikingly unique ; it begs not to be watched in the same manner as a conventional narrative film . Like a great painting , it is meant to be savored , pored over , observed from different angles and revisited in time . [ Blu-ray ] Playtime is a peculiar , mysterious , magical film . A film comedy directed with the grace of a ballet , the painstaking detail of an action painting and the affection of a love song ... Pic takes to the 70mm process with an extraordinary impressionistic outdoor set of a new Paris , and is an observant romp during a one-day stay of a group of tourists . 	A remarkable achievement , Playtime 's packs every scene with sight gags and characters that both celebrates and satirizes the urbanization of modern life .
the prince and me Naive wish-fulfillment fantasy of surface charm . You might say that when it comes to misfires , this Prince rules . This soggy contemporary fairy tale is a cinematic cream puff with a melted marshmallow inside it . ... generally remains a cut above the majority of its contemporary romcom brethren - with the dreaded fake break-up handled particularly well ( the second fake break-up is kind of pushing it , though ) . Paige eventually comes to a self-affirming decision , but the Danish interlude succeeds too well in making us feel her boredom . Something is rotten in the state of Denmark -- and it 's this movie , a flyweight romantic comedy . A movie that mixes contrivance and charm in ways that are genial but all too predictable . The wonderful chemistry between Stiles and Mably is a joy to behold . Two vibrant performances by Luke Mably and Julia Stiles do n't compensate for the wobbly screenplay and predictable finale . The minefield of clichs is traversed quite satisfactorily , leaving us with a movie that 's far better than its lame premise would lead us to expect . 	A bland , fluffy , and predictable bit of wish fulfillment .
hanna This slick thriller features inventive action sequences and terrific actors who offset more over-the-top moments . So loosely plotted as to be laughable , this adrenalized fairy tale has the high-gloss sheen of a Bourne flick , but none of the smarts . Consider yourself warned : The more you dwell on Hanna 's story , the less there is to enjoy . A wild ride , implausible and ridiculous . But , yes , fun . It 's like an amusement park ride operating in the middle of a rave in which The Chemical Brothers provide a no-one-gets-out-alive thrust of unimpeded propulsion . The film exists in a peculiar no-man 's land between Hollywood and art . With an A-list cast and incredible production values , Hanna is a speeding train . Hop on and hold on tight . For all the skill she has ... [ Hanna ] is ultimately reduced ... to just a little girl who becomes lost in the figurative forest after leaving the literal one . Wright never met a flashy edit or swirling camera move he did n't like . On a purely physical level , Hanna grabs you by the throat and never lets go Between the top-notch cast , cracking fight sequences , and pulse-pounding score courtesy of The Chemical Brothers , Hanna is the perfect appetizer for the summer season . 	Fantastic acting and crisply choreographed action sequences propel this unique , cool take on the revenge thriller .
tucker the man and his dream Fluent , brave and touching . Tucker came up with a classic , but poor Coppola has turned a great American tragedy into a gas-guzzling human comedy . If 12-year old boys had money , Tucker would have made a million overnight Celebrates the indomitable spirit of entrepreneurs whose dreams can be dashed but never taken away from them . Francis Ford Coppola and Lucasfilm in top form bring to the screen the story of automotive legend Preston Tucker . The film is a tribute to American creativity and a lament about a system that wastes genius . One of Francis Ford Coppola 's great movies that slipped through the cracks in the late 80 's . The result is a film consistent narratively , confident stylistically and abounce with the quaint quality that animated both the hero and his times , something we used to call pep . There 's plenty to recommend it . But it 's also a partially wasted opportunity , as this good film could have been a great one . Seems George Lucas ca n't make anything great out of Tatooinie A cheerful and light approach to potentially heavy material . 	Though it may not be as comprehensive as some would like , Francis Ford Coppola 's cheerful biopic of the failed automotive designer features sparkling direction and a strong central performance from Jeff Bridges .
real steel With the heart and soul of Rocky , Real Steel really packs a wallop . Quite cheesy , yet exhilarating and mindlessly entertaining . It 's a fun , crowd-pleasing popcorn movie that will leave you hungry for a sequel . Child star Dakota Goyo has a very bright future ahead of him . Cliched underdog sports movie , that 's predictable , contrived and its familiar derivative plot line is put to poor use . Real heart trumps real steel ! 'I was the only boxer who knew every song to Rodgers & Hammerstein 's Carousel and had my own Tommy Tune tribute band , ' said Hugh Jackman , whose career has taken him from Wolverine to glucosamine . action-packed and genuinely moving as it aspires to be , and is , more than a live-action version of a popular 60s robot boxing game Given that it 's a story about a father and son who bond over outsized games of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and is directed by the guy who made the Night At The Museum movies , Real Steel has surprising heart and intelligence . Only those with a heart of tin could resist . Real Steel is a blast , an unabashed crowd-pleaser that mixes Rocky , Transformers , video games and father-son bonding to great , if corny , effect . You 've probably seen toy commercials that present a more thoughtful dystopian future . And yet , in the moment , this film will make you want to do nothing except stuff your face with more . 	Silly premise notwithstanding , this is a well-made Hollywood movie : Thrilling and exciting action with just enough characterization .
end of days Arnold , Arnold , Arnold , what were you thinking when you signed on to do this ? Director Peter Hyams propels End of Days with a series of crash-and-burn sequences that express the archetypal link between Satan and fire . The biggest problem here was the script . Taken as pure popcorn-munchin ' fun , Days is an enjoyable , if sometimes bumpy , ride . Many sins have been committed in the name of religion ; End of Days ranks as the latest . We 're treated to such a broad panoply of godawful dialogue , righteously shoddy acting , and , worst of all for an action blockbuster of this sort , subpar effects work , that it 's all you can do not to giggle helplessly . This movie gets stuck in purgatory . The movie pits Arnold Schwarzenegger against the devil ( Gabriel Byrne ) , with director Peter Hyams delivering tense moments of action amid not-so-subtle choices for character development . Is n't a bad movie by any means ; it 's just a reasonably silly one that , in one form or the other , has been overdone to death . Hyams seems able to establish a rhythm and keep the sequence clear . It 's when people talk that he tends to get into trouble . 	An overblown thriller with formulaic action scenes and poor acting .
autumn in new york Charlotte and Will make a charming couple , but that has a lot to do with Ryder 's doomed gamine presence and Gere 's world-weary rogue . Autumn in New York is saddled with a sappy , silly script . Just what it promises to be : a Love Story-style romance . Ryder looks like she does n't want to be anywhere near Gere , no less have him touch her . If the movie ... exhibits a loving eye for Manhattan exteriors , it 's undone by its own rigidly old-fashioned conventions . This love story never convincingly goes beyond the depth of two good-looking people falling in love based on their looks . The film works best of all as a vehicle for Richard Gere , who has simply never looked better or held the screen more securely . All style and no substance . Tax forms have more emotional content . The quintessential chick flick , and it 's not going to seduce anyone who does n't have a taste for this kind of schmaltz in the first place . But for what it is , it 's well done . 	Although the film is n't as bad as feared ( it was n't pre-screened for reviews ) , it 's not that good , either . Most noticable flaws are the sappy romantic cliches and lack of chemistry between Gere and Ryder .
millennium-actress A striking achievement . Kon and co-writer Sadayuki Murai 's cleverly slippery story bursts with real passion , overcoming the lack of technical achievement . To watch Millennium Actress ' is to witness one cinematic medium celebrating another , an expression of movie love that is wonderfully eccentric and deeply affecting . The finest anime film I 've ever seen . Millennium Actress has more layers to it than the proverbial onion , but Kon 's sure hand keeps things moving right along . Arty Japanese animated drama is too complex for little ones . Given its complex array of fact , fiction , location , character and atmosphere , Millennium Actress is almost unimaginable in any other medium . Frequently a stone bore . ... in its own way as structurally inventive as the recent `American Splendor . ' The animation in Millennium Actress ... and Chiyoko 's wistful suffering is made achingly real . 	The story of an aging movie actress ' complicated personal saga unfolds in this sophisticated anime film that deftly blurs memory and make-believe into a meditation on the nature of cinema itself .
milyang-secret-sunshine Buried in the year-end rush but one of the year 's best films . The film is brave and unsparing ( as is Jeon 's performance ) and asks some challenging and disquieting questions ... [ S ] low portrait of damaged woman struggling against community expectations reveals universality [ in ] extraordinary Do-yeon who dramatically shifts gears again [ and again ] . An uncompromising experiment in how much suffering a soul can take , both on screen and in one 's cinema seat . Even as the film piles awkwardness and suffering upon its character , it never feels exploitative or emotionally manipulative , maintaining a restrained tone entirely devoid of melodrama . Can a movie traumatize you in a good way ? An ambitious , almost novelistic pic by writer-helmer Lee Chang-dong that ultimately fails to dramatize its lead character 's conflicts in cinematic terms . This fourth film from Lee Chang-dong , one of the leading lights in the new South Korean cinema , begins as a young widow moves to the small town of Milyang , where her late husband was born and where she plans to work as a piano teacher . The cinematic equivalent of prose that is clear , elegant and lyrical . There 's more truth and wisdom in Secret Sunshine than I 've seen at the movies in a long time . 	Plumbing the depths of tragedy without succuming to melodrama , Chang-dong Lee 's Secret Sunshine is a grueling , albeit moving , piece of beautifully acted cinema .
10008655-whiteout An Antarctic-set murder mystery that might have played well on the printed page but emerges as a slushy mess on the screen . Sadly , Whiteout wimps out , starting out like The Thing and winding up like CSI : South Pole , wasting whatever it has going for it . Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that it 'll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history . A whodunnit set on a scientific research base in Antarctica that slowly becomes a `` Who cares ? '' A dreadful sleeping pill , marching into production with the best intentions in the world , but coming out the other side a jumbled , incompetent , ludicrously underlined whodunit . Whiteout offers nothing to satisfy fans of the comic and nothing to satisfy even the casual filmgoer just looking for diversion or escape from the heat . Devoid of personality and full of characters so one-dimensional that they are n't even worth mentioning in this review , Whiteout is a movie that sees no-one emerge with any credit . Whiteout has a good premise and a likeable lead , but it goes rapidly downhill and is ultimately disappointing . Gallons of the titular correction fluid may have helped Dominic Sena 's abysmal thriller if it had been applied at just about any juncture during the graphic novel-to-feature film script stage . What a stiff . 	Kate Beckinsale is as lovely as ever , and does her best with the material , but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold .
guardians of the galaxy If you want a superior successor to Red Dwarf , Blake 's 7 , Star Wars and , yes , Scooby Doo then look no further . There are worse things . The audience applauded . All ages , all walks of life , got hooked on a feeling - a feeling of delight - that 'Guardians of the Galaxy ' delivers . It all happens about 100 times faster than the original Star Wars while taking itself about 1,000 times less seriously than the Star Wars prequels . Guardians bounces with the energy of pure invention . Guardians of the Galaxy is just an obscene amount of fun . Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable , or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out . Definitely worth a second look , just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on . The best debut for a Marvel franchise since 'Iron Man . ' What sets this film apart from the less effective summer movies is that director James Gunn has put together a cast that can handle the action and the humor . `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' is pop film-making at its purest . I could watch a `` Guardians '' movie that 's just the five of them sitting around a table with a pitcher of beer and a deck of cards . Hard to say that about the X-Men . 	Guardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect -- as well as funny , thrilling , full of heart , and packed with visual splendor .
cropsey Cropsey has all the trappings of a true-crime TV special , but with an undercurrent of cultural exposition that is intelligent , profound and unsettling . On several levels , this film is a real-life horror story that puts most Hollywood movies to shame . Documentary of a spate of child kidnappings/killings in Staten Island , New York , in the 1970s , tied thematically to the titular Hudson Valley boogeyman myth . Zeman and Brancaccio structure the film as a sort of homemade murder procedural , where pavement-pounding crowd-sourcing proposes an alternative to the modern cold-case staple of DNA evidence . ... the stuff of horror films , and the way it folds back into the idea of how the Cropsey stories spread ... that 's the stuff that Cropsey does best . The best , scariest mysteries do n't have definitive answers , and Cropsey becomes a Zodiac-style whodunit of the spookiest order . Begins as the documentation of a terrible legend , but evolves into a true story of a monster , and that 's what makes Cropsey downright frightening . This horrifying documentary stirs up , if not confirms , your worst fears . The film is eerie and thought-provoking , raising worthwhile questions about the pursuit of justice without losing compassion for the victims or their families . The portentous narration and manipulative horror-film aesthetics turn what might have been a portrait of a boogeyman myth 's lingering societal role into merely a crude episode of 48 Hours . 	Riveting and bone-chillingly creepy , Cropsey manages to be one of the best documentaries and one of the best horror movies of the year .
cartel land Heinman 's uncompromising camera work makes this a brutal documentary . [ full review in Spanish ] A jaw-dropping documentary about two vigilante groups , on opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border , trying to stave off Mexican drug cartels . Horribly real , an urgent and alarming account of a crisis so hellishly labyrinthine it 's hard to see how anyone can escape its widening web of violence , extortion and corruption . Without passing moral judgments on either group , `` Cartel Land '' provides a vivid illustration of the dangers inherent whenever a government fails to meet its citizens ' needs to the extent that they take matters into their own hands . Heineman earns major props for his courage under fire while also capturing striking and indelible images . Heineman 's close-up look at the war on drugs bathes the situation in the personal stakes of the figures enmeshed in these thorny dilemmas on a daily basis . Filmmaker Matthew Heineman places himself in the line of fire more than once in this shocking and eye-opening real-life expose of the illegal drug industry in Mexico . Not for the faint of heart , it sometimes puts its cameras right it the middle of gun battles , for a result that is extremely dramatic even if it also leaves a number of important questions regrettably unanswered . A worthwhile report on a pressing humanitarian issue . The results are astounding . Cartel Land is staggering , stunning . The best documentary I 've seen in a very long time . 	Raw , brutal , and bitter , Cartel Land offers a ground-level look at vigilante efforts to thwart organized crime at the Mexican-American border .
your highness reveals at some point a stunt-crotch who will no doubt bash Portman in a few months ' time and take the lustre entirely off this complete failure ... The comic mojo of Danny McBride can be a thing of fucked-up beauty . So I was stoked that McBride signed on as star and co-writer of Your Highness . But the air goes out of that balloon pretty damn quick . Lots of balls . Also lots of penis jokes . But too loud and obvious . Your Highness is a tale of derring-do in the tradition of Sinbad the Sailor , complete with thrilling escapades , high jinks and some pretty exciting action sequences . Your Highness never sacrifices its cheerful , one-thing-after-another absurdity , or its inability to take itself even remotely seriously . McBride , who also created the indelible character of Kenny Powers on HBO 's `` Eastbound and Down , '' has most of the good lines and he makes the most of them Suffers from a chronically lazy script , irritating characters and dirth of funny ideas . I found myself laughing a lot at this rotten movie . Stoners may freak out , sober viewers should grow restless , and no one will laugh much . `` Your Highness '' is plagued by a shortage of laughs . 	Big budgets and costumes in service of scatalogical jokes may seem funny on paper , but in execution this is a highly monotonous romp that registers only occasional laughs .
enemy of the state It has a hurtling pace , nonstop intensity and a stylish , appealing performance by Will Smith ! What do you say about a movie that sends you home in a frenzy to search for bugs ? In the new age of Big Brother , that 's entertainment . If you want to believe in the dark side of government , we are already past the predictions of Enemy of the State . This movie plays like a 90 's updating of Coppola 's 1974 classic that dealt with surveillance , the erosion of privacy , and the escalating paranoia that you can never completely be alone because someone could always be listening . The film holds together well and is intense most of the way through . An enjoyable escapist thriller . Hard to sit through . In case you have n't figured it out yet , you 're being watched as you read this . An exciting if often overheated thriller ! If the creation of paranoia is entertainment , Enemy of the State works . The movie has plenty of high-tech power , spinning out action so explosive you 'll hardly notice how preposterous the story is or how cardboard-thin the characters are . 	An entertaining , topical thriller that finds director Tony Scott on solid form and Will Smith confirming his action headliner status .
ultimate x the movie All of this looks great on the giant IMAX screen -- most things do -- but the filmmakers ca n't shake the sense that this is an inflated TV special . Most of Ultimate X is comprised of truly exhilarating footage of men -- and one woman -- pushing their bodies and their nerve to the edge . This Imax sports documentary captures the danger , thrills , spills and sheer altitude attained by the young men and women who put it all on the line for burgeoning 'Xtreme sports ' movement . These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . It 's a dizzyingly entertaining thrill-ride , complete with a pleasantly surprising amount of humor and self-parody . At 40 minutes , it 's brief but keeps firmly to its action remit . The result is that the skill and determination , not to mention bravery or lunacy , of the extreme sportsmen ( and women ) is shown on a strikingly grand scale . Special P.O.V . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen . The competitors are clearly unhinged , but they put on a hell of a show . It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 	Taking full advantage of the large IMAX screen , Ultimate X is a thrill ride for extreme sports junkies and novices alike .
knight and day This is a summer action film and it does deliver on the promise of action . While the action is so extreme as to border on silliness , this is often done intentionally for comic effect . Knight and Day is by no means the worst film of the summer , but with a flailing Cruise on board , it feels like the most desperate . The exciting `` Knight And Day '' is a blast that stays in Cruise control . Attempts to walk a delicate tightrope , simultaneously parodying and indulging in outrageous super-spy action , and fails in both endeavors . It 's a film absolutely of the moment ; you 're not going to come out of it debating its finer points . An action star who does n't glower -- what a relief ! It 's not a bad movie . It 's not exactly a good movie , either , but it 's got its moments . Knight and Day is a film about charisma and on-screen chemistry , but unfortunately not much else . A film to cheer audiences , 12 and slightly upwards , not seduce critics ... An incidental romance punctuated with out-of-one's-element humor and computer-assisted chase sequences , wholly weightless . As a pure popcorn , dreams-writ-large , kiss-kiss-bang-bang , globetrotting romp , Knight and Day delivers . [ Blu-ray ] 	It 's pure formula , but thanks to its breezy pace and a pair of charming performances from Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz , Knight and Day offers some agreeably middle-of-the-road summer action .
the patience stone `` The Patience Stone '' is essentially a monologue , and Atiq Rahimi ( directing the adaptation of his own novel ) does n't have what it takes to make the story more dynamic . Sensual and horrifying , The Patience Stone plays like a mesmerizing , modern take on the tales of Scheherazade and a parable on the suffering of Afghan women . Some movies prove both immediately transformative - altering how we view the world as soon as we leave the theater - and long-lasting , demanding days or weeks of reflection . The only ferociousness comes from Farahani ... She gives The Patience Stone its gravitas . A unique , intimately scaled and enormously affecting dissection of patriarchal culture , anchored by a wonderful performance from Golshifteh Farahani . It 's Rahimi 's courage as both writer and director that makes this intense and perceptive picture so unflinchingly compelling . Life and death circle each other restlessly and then furiously in the Afghan-set movie `` The Patience Stone . '' A genuine political psychodrama that makes its point with a sledgehammer . If Rahimi begins his film in a room so bare it resembles a cell , he ends it in the selfsame one like something out of 'Arabian Nights , ' his oppressed wife rendered Sheherazade . The bare room where the husband lies helpless becomes a confessional where Farahani pours out the woman 's life story in a performance that grabs you with its quiet yet searing power . 	It may prove frustratingly slow for some viewers , but more contemplative filmgoers will find themselves rewarded by The Patience Stone 's quietly fierce storytelling , as well as a searing starring turn from Golshifteh Farahani .
you only live twice None of Dahl 's gifts for dark humor or sparkling writing is evident . Although the script is good , it is a direct descendent of all of the preceding Bond scripts and breaks no new ground . ... an awfully minor entry within Connery 's 007 run . the action scenes are quite enjoyable and the special effects are terrific . But the story is just so lazy and lackluster that I became uninterested during any scenes that did n't contain gunshots or explosions . This noisy and wildly violent picture ... is evidently pegged to the notion that nothing succeeds like excess . And because it is shamelessly excessive , it is about a half-hour too long . ... one that some connoisseurs consider a high point in the series and others think is a miss . I favor the latter view . The plot is the problem . It stretches the limits of credibility , even as that word is applied to Bond movies . While Dahl clearly helped thrust Bond into a whole new world of villainy and technology , maybe his concepts were slightly ahead of themselves , or maybe he just tried too hard . Roald Dahl 's implausible script is padded out with the usual exotic locations , stunts , and trickery . Blofeld 's volcano hideout is one of the most impressive of Ken Adam 's sets for the franchise , and it is a pleasure to watch it be completely destroyed . Sean Connery 's disenchantment with his starring role is unmistakable in this , the fifth Bond spectacular . 	With exotic locales , impressive special effects , and a worthy central villain , You Only Live Twice overcomes a messy and implausible story to deliver another memorable early Bond flick .
color purple Inspiring , sentimental tale of survival . Unashamedly emotional , it either totally grabs you or leaves you cold . Spielberg 's classicism comes to be appreciated in a goosebumps-inducing send-off for Mister . Spielberg may not have been the best choice to direct this feminist text , making a clean , neat movie that lacks authenticity , but the movie has many touching moments and the entire female ensemble is good , particularly Whoopi Goldberg in the second half It is unquestionably overwrought , but it is a truly lovely film with a lot of emotion in it . The meaning of all that emotion is unfortunately still up for grabs . Brilliant , disturbing storytelling by Spielberg with standout performances . `` a should-have-been masterpiece that admittedly has its moments '' A far better film than is usually thought . It is a great , warm , hard , unforgiving , triumphant movie , and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it . ... we can forgive Spielberg his indulgences when the outcome is so profoundly moving . 	A sentimental tale that reveals great emotional truths in American history .
lost boys of sudan Yearns to be optimistic ( juxtaposed with the disaster of Sudan , it certainly has the right to be ) , yet that only ends up underscoring its ache of sadness . The scenes of Peter and Santino 's adjustment to life in Houston -- a garbage disposal does what ? -- are at once quotidian , poignant and absurd . Reveals with remarkable clarity the clash of dreams vs. reality , hope vs. day-to-day despair . The filmmakers deftly capture the boys ' depression and triumphs , but something of the American character -- the generosity and the arrogance -- as well . Too short by half , Lost Boys of Sudan affords frustratingly little by way of real analysis and history . But it does introduce us to two extraordinary young men whose faith in this country is almost as unbearably sad as their stories . These two young men and their bittersweet stories ... are haunting and unforgettable ... The fact that it 's an old story does n't mean that this new telling of it does n't , in its rather simple and unaffected way , carry considerable impact . The film also does n't get across the magnitude of the horror unfolding in the Sudan . This is a very moving filmed document . Both uplifting and troubling . 	The Lost boys of Sudan works as both a riveting documentary and scathing indictment of colonialism .
1106648-lie This is scary but great Difficult and flawed feature debut . There 's nothing about Cox 's poised yet poignant playing that 's unconvincing . You know you 're in the hands of a born filmmaker when he floods a scene with danger and excitement and , at the same time , tempers it with something more delicate . Superior and original filmmaking . You wo n't be able to take your eyes off it . This dystopic suburban teen 's eye view of that journey to difficult adulthood , redefines the notion of road movie as inner road rage in enormous , chilling ways . Cuesta never gives us the satisfaction of fulfilling our expectations ; instead he gives us a movie that we can ponder long the road takes its final turn . ... deserves to be seen for the incredibly subtle performances of the two male leads A penetrating look at a 14-year-old boy 's relationship with a pederast . A disturbing and provocative study of adolescence and isolation . 	L.I.E . is a well-acted and unsettling look at a boy 's relationship with a pedophile .
beowulf Beowulf brays and boasts , it overwhelms and it soars . Like the tendency to exaggerate inherent in its hero , it 's a majestic movie that does n't quite add up to the epic we anticipate . I came , saw , had my retinas fried , and was conquered . The best thing about this movie is that it makes an ancient story into something that is a lot more accessible to most people . 700 A.D. is now 21st Century American 3-D . It 's a hell of a transformation . The 3-D version of Beowulf -- the one you must see if you see the film -- is a wild roller coaster ride . Beowulf is being released in standard 2-D and a non-Imax 3-D version , neither of which I 've seen , and neither of which I would recommend as long as there is an opportunity for the sensory overload of Imax 3-D . Stands as an unapologetically enthusiastic marriage between old-school heroism and modern-day wizardry . Plus it kicks ass ! Those who remember the 3000 line epic from 8th grade English will be pleasantly surprised to learn they 've scrapped the original plot altogether . Gaiman and Avery deserve credit for making the Beowulf poem come full circle , but it is not the cinematic knockout I was hoping for . [ S ] terile , synthetic , almost completely unengaging on a human level . It 's animated but inanimate . The adaptation replaces the two-dimensional characters of the epic poem with more human , nuanced individuals . 	Featuring groundbreaking animation , stunning visuals , and a talented cast , Beowulf has in spades what more faithful book adaptations forget to bring : pure cinematic entertainment .
demolition man Basically , Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre . Chock-full of obnoxious dialogue , terrible acting , and oh-so-clever product placement . Does n't quite go far enough , instead settling for cheap gags and cheap thrills , but it tickles fairly well for a couple of hours of crashes and fireballs . [ Blu-ray ] A great villain goes a long way toward making an action movie successful and Snipes certainly does more than his share to make this an enjoyable film . Demolition Man is sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless . It feels computer engineered , untouched by human hands . A real pod movie . Stallone and Snipes are a great double-act Enjoyable pop-culture junk actioner . A noisy , soulless , self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi , action-adventure and romance , then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes . The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script , and Stallone , are funny ; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that Last Action Hero tried , and failed , to do . This futuristic comedy depends on your opinion of Stallone and his unapologetic popcorn-pleasing action no-brainers . To be fair , this one is one of his better ones . 	A better-than-average sci-fi shoot-em-up with a satirical undercurrent , Demolition Man is bolstered by strong performances by Sylvester Stallone , Wesley Snipes , and Sandra Bullock .
courage under fire The end of the film understandably lays on the emotion a little heavily , but until then Courage Under Fire has been a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle . An extremely moving picture that left me with my heart racing and my arms clutching myself and staring at the screen . As the detective-story flashback structure gets under way , what initially seemed adherence to dramatic and moral clich becomes more complex and interesting . Courage Under Fire , like the double meaning of its title , is subtle in ways , but is a powerful depiction of the meaning of courage . A carefully conceived , dramatically honorable picture that treats its subject with clarity and intelligence , especially by contemporary standards . Excellent military mystery . Rashomon style point of view play . Denzel Washington reinforces his image as a serious leading man who dominates a film with his quiet intensity and aura of introspection . While its re-creation of combat is not Courage Under Fire 's most involving aspect , the film succeeds in making the Gulf War seem more of a real event than all the footage shipped back on CNN could . A provocative film with Oscar caliber performances . ( published 7-19-96 ) A riveting contemporary wartime melodrama . 	An emotional and intriguing tale of a military officer who must review the merits of a fallen officer while confronting his own war demons . Effectively depicts the terrors of war as well as its heartbreaking aftermath .
dumb and dumber a bit too dumb ... a modern classic of the comedy genre ... ... it tickles the funny bone often enough to merit serious consideration among lowbrow comedies . This virtually laughless movie makes rude junior high school pranks seem positively sophisticated . Given American cinema 's current obsession with innocence and ignorance , at least this never romanticises its protagonists . They are genuinely , irredeemably , 100 per cent no-hopers . Easily one of the funniest ( and most quotable ) movies ever made ... Dumb & Dumber does n't have the greatest of plots nor the most impressive direction there is , but it 's hysterically funny , which is more than enough for me to recommend it heartily . A movie that fully lives up to its name , right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors . Despretensiosamente ingnuo , 'Dbi & Lide ' a maior prova de que um filme nem sempre precisa ter uma trama elaborada para agradar . The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it 's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise . 	A relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors : Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance .
13 tzameti This is one independent hit that could probably benefit from big-budget studio treatment . French art thriller 13 Tzameti has a literal hair-trigger premise , yet it 's so lacking in human dimensions that it creates virtually no suspense . ... a film noir look reminiscent of the 1940 's but with an excitement that is thoroughly new millennium [ Babluani ] creates a fear so bottomless , a bad dream so plausible that its hooks tear into your consciousness . This stylish heart-pounder is one of the more substance-free flicks of late , but gun to your head , you could do a lot worse . The earned payoff is an all-too-believable shocker . Starts slowly but builds , Hitchcock-style , to a terrifying crescendo . What a depressing spectacle . But it 's the most good-looking , well-acted , tension-filled depressing spectacle you 're likely to see any time soon . In a way , 13 ( Tzameti ) is a nearly gore-free take on Hostel , another film ... about desperate attempts to survive in a place that 's simultaneously culturally and geographically alien . Although it 's likely too stark for everyone , 13 Tzameti offers a mind-blowing experience for anyone willing to go along for the ride . 	This starkly minimalist nail-biter of a thriller relentlessly builds up the tension and keeps the audience guessing .
jonestown the life and death of peoples temple A gripping , provocative documentary . One of the most chilling aspects of Jonestown is its use of the audio tapes of Jones speaking on Nov. 18 , 1978 . Jones was a charlatan who faked healings , demanded sexual favors of members and committed all sorts of criminal acts . ... riveting documentary ... Offers a sophisticated thesis , digging into the reasons why people joined the Peoples Temple . From idealistic beginnings to the horror-movie ending , a singular episode of history is peeled open to expose a raw and ugly core . While Jonestown lacks the power of revelation , it 's a first-rate piece of journalism , as fascinating and thorough as any magazine article . Documented proof that life in the good old days of the 1960s was not all that good . The dark side of love and flowers . One of the year 's most important documentaries , a real must-see . If anything , this absorbing documentary is too short , a rare occurrence these days . 	Director Stanley Nelson avoids editorializing and sensationalizing in Jonestown , letting the CIA photos and film speak for themselves , and giving a voice to the surviving victims .
sanctum Inoffensive but extremely and earnestly dull . For much of the film , and despite groan-worthy dialogue that often takes you right out of the picture , you 'll likely be holding your breath in genuine suspense . Producer James Cameron 's fondness for the deep , dark fissures in both man and nature takes a serious hit with this messy , atrociously written , and unevenly acted descent into a subterranean adventure . Subterranean thriller buries plot , unlikable characters and tension . If not for the by-the-numbers script , a slim collection of underdeveloped characters and generally flat acting , the film could have had a real punch . The action does n't quite conjure up the claustrophobic intensity you expect but the father-son-storyline is sufficiently muscular . ... everybody , including director Alister Grierson , does their middling best ... Unfortunately , the script is so horrible and the characters so distinctly unlikable , we are rarely as connected to the action as we really should be . There 's a good story buried within it but it would have been better had any of the leading characters not been made of cardboard . Documentary filmmaker turned writer Andrew Wight is unable to convert his own real-life experiences of being trapped by flood waters into the emotional depth of other survival movies like The Descent , Buried and 127 Hours . 	Sanctum is beautifully photographed , and it makes better use of 3-D technology than most , but that does n't make up for its ham-handed script and lifeless cast .
escape from the planet of the apes Oneof the best of the bunch ! Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film , almost as good as the original Planet of the Apes . feels like a quickie insert that is needed to progress the larger narrative , but does n't have enough meat on it to deserve its own film Brings just enough of a twist to the series ' conventions . Passable entertainment , but it 's no fun watching the likable , witty Cornelius and Zira become hairy martyrs . The last of the `` Ape '' sequels that 's worth watching . Possibly the least of the series , but certainly not a predictable sequel . The best of the all of the sequels . the film is a highly satisfying mix of satire and suspense This second sequel serves as little more than a light appetizer with a memorable and poignant ending . 	One of the better Planet of the Apes sequels , Escape is more character-driven than the previous films , and more touching as a result .
offside Exhilarating , exuberant and drolly funny . Offside is a slow slog through bloated scenes with little happening . Framed and shot like a crude documentary , it proceeds in long , clunky takes , as if an editor could n't be bothered . The delicately subversive [ director ] Mr. Panahi makes his subjects perfectly clear -- the stupidity of authority , and the hypocrisy of discrimination . Offside is surprisingly entertaining , and edifying to boot . The rare Iranian film that is not only thoughtful and thought-provoking but also a lot of fun . It 's a spirited , feisty , bouncy film , with little feel of contrivance . Cet effort parfois maladroit dans sa propre prudence n'inspirera srement pas le dbat de socit qu'il cherche crer Panahi has learned how to use natural space , both confined and open , as the foundation for the film . Thankfully , this cinematic process rolls right over any ideas of generic plot . Posits an exhilarating , ephemeral sense of cultural inclusiveness It 's too bad that Hollywood , which is always interested in making another anti-American picture , could n't make a few showing the consequences of Islamic oppression . Offside may be the ultimate Iranian film : It 's both an advance for its director , moving away from his slight political didacticism , and a perfect metaphor for a population that 's more liberated than its stone-age sexism would imply . 	A spirited film that explores gender politics with comedy , intelligence , and a variety of interesting characters .
youth in revolt Arteta commits to the lasciviousness , turning Youth in Revolt into more of a self-aware , comedic adaptation of Scott Spencer 's Endless Love , which was originally botched by Franco Zeffireli . The result is a brassy and unique production that might eventually land in the same cult classic territory as the C.D . Payne book it 's based on . When Francois Dillinger is on screen , the movie comes alive ... the rest of the time it 's that post-Napoleon Dynamite sort of plodding study of eccentricity . If you 're looking for constant chuckles , memorable scenes , quirky dialogue and hilarious characters then get youthful , get some sweeties and get involved . It 's chaotic and episodic , but this is Cera 's star turn . Superbad meets Fight Club ? That 'll do it . Call this one the thinking boy 's sex romp . A stunningly lazy , smarmy comedy with very few honest laughs . All credit to Cera for trying something a little different . It 's just a shame Youth in Revolt feels so episodic and shapeless that it 's hard to take any pleasure in its theatre of cruelty . A little too manic for its own good , Youth in Revolt is restless and unruly . Too often forcibly mean-spirited , it only elicits a handful of genuine laughs . It runs out of inspiration eventually . But not before a solid hour or so of consistently amusing absurdist humor that 's way more off-kilter than is usual for a comedy about randy young men . 	It may not entirely do its source material justice , but Miguel Arteta 's Youth in Revolt is a fun , funny comic romp that lets Michael Cera stretch a little and introduces filmgoers to a major find in Portia Doubleday .
battleship potemkin Sergei Eisenstein 's masterpiece is a persistently political work salvaged by its unforgettable grasp of motion . Edward Tiss 's camerawork remains impressive , and there 's no doubt that the whole is a technical tour de force , but the obsession with forces of power , as opposed to individual experience , is ultimately oppressive . If you are at all interested in the history of cinema , or the influence of 20th century politics on the medium , then this film is a must-see , although over an hour of Soviet propaganda is likely to test the patience of modern viewers . For a piece of propaganda , this has a lot more artfulness than you 'll recall , replete with quiet moments of public mourning and a stirring flag-hoisting ( dyed red on the new print , too ) . comes from a time where films communicated primarily through images , even if its themes fade into historical irrelevance . It is still a pleasure to view again a film which , without fully knowing it , wrote the grammar of cinema . A work of straightforward emotion and pulse-quickening tension . Capturing a unique moment in time , Eisentsein 's 1925 masterpiece is a must-see for viewers interested in film theory , history , and aesthetics , and not just because of its seminal Odessa Steps sequence , later imitated by many directors . The direction of Sergei Eisenstein is original and powerful . Startlingly beautiful . 	A technical masterpiece , Battleship Potemkin is Soviet cinema at its finest , and its montage editing techniques remain influential to this day .
predestination One of Ethan Hawke 's strengths as an actor is his willingness to jump between arthouse fare and B-movie genre fodder . Predestination is a wildly , weirdly rollicking ride . Underestimate the Spierigs - experts at turning trashy genre excursions into fare that 's exhilarating , entertaining and profoundly thoughtful - at your own peril . Put the time-travel gibberish into the background and the result is a great , gritty Aussie noir flick not to be missed . It might bewildering , but chances are , you 'll enjoy the trip from the inventive Spierig Bros , whose wild concepts about inevitability , reshaping wrong doings and time travel will prompt agile brain gymnastics Writer-directors Peter and Michael Spierig show affinities for serious literature as well as pulp fiction ; interwoven with the loopy SF plotting are some rather grown-up considerations of longing and psychological pain . A thoughtful , if wonky , small-scale epic of retro-futurism . Had this been any more sincere or stony-faced it simply would n't work , instead thriving in the frivolity of it all . Predestination twists and turns so often you wo n't be sure which way to look . Intelligent and thought-provoking , [ Predestination ] works effectively on most levels despite numerous and occasionally confusing leaps in logic and eras , The film effectively underlines the one undertaking that time-travel fantasies can never truly allow : escape from ourselves . 	Fun genre fare with uncommon intelligence , Predestination serves as a better-than-average sci-fi adventure -- and offers a starmaking turn from Sarah Snook .
sisterhood of the traveling pants You may actually think it 's going somewhere at the time . But ultimately , you realize it 's only going through the motions . A super-estrogenized movie , no doubt , but it speaks rather warmly and sincerely to the universal struggles of adolescence . For the legions of fans of the book , this movie is one-size-fits-all . The rest of us will have to keep shopping . A movie that pre-teen and adolescent girls will embrace . ( Pre-teen and adolescent girls will also embrace Chad , Jesse , Lindsay , Hilary , fake tans , designer cellphones , junior prom and Uggs , so proceed with caution . ) I am unquestionably not a member of the target demographic for Ken Kwapis ' The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , but that did n't prevent me from enjoying it . If you want to get a sense of how this differs from its immediate competition , Lords of Dogtown , look no further than the roles played in both by America Ferrara . As coming-of-age films go , the big-screen adaptation of Ann Brashares ' popular novel is one of the more bathetic . Everything Bullock 's 'Ya Ya 's ' wanted to be Working from a deft script by Delia Ephron , director Ken Kwapis labors hard so that guys wo n't cringe ( too much ) as four teen girls , of different body types , pass along the same pair of lucky jeans during a summer of love and loss . Sisterhood inhabits a tricky slot -- the subject matter is a little mature for tween audiences , and too glossed over for adults -- but succeeds , due entirely to charismatic Tamblyn and devastating Ferrera . 	This adaptation of a beloved novel charms with its heartwarming tale of friendship and young adulthood ; realistic portrayals of the lives of teenage girls lend the comedy-drama sincerity , and may capture hearts outside the female-centric demographic .
alien An empty-headed horror movie with nothing to recommend it beyond the disco-inspired art direction and some handsome , if gimmicky , cinematography . The most startling thing watching Alien again is its pacing . For the first 45 minutes , little happens . It 's all slow , exquisite build-up , which makes the second half seem all the more horrific . Both the Nostromo and the alien world where the alien gets picked up are strange and unforgettably original . Alien has power , elicits terror , and the acid blood scars your consciousness . This scary feature breathed new life into the horror genre , launching a length film franchise and introducing to audiences a major actress , Sigourney Weaver , in a tough role typically allotted to men . Remains one of the best examples of sustained tension . There is a sense of ominousness , a sense that something bad is going to happen , from the moment the film begins . Technically , Scott has consistently demonstrated that he ranks among the best popular film artists . Unfortunately , Scott 's film does n't work for me as well in other areas . Superior science fiction and the best haunted house movie ever made . A sci-fi thriller of palpable , nerve-tingling tension , with Sigourney Weaver -- playing warrant officer Ellen Ripley -- in stunning form . ... a seminal feminist action flick . 	A modern classic , Alien blends science fiction , horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole .
the karate kid part iii The makers of The Karate Kid Part III -- also responsible for its successful predecessors -- have either delivered or taken a few too many kicks to the head along the way . It 's difficult to believe that nearly every member of the primary artistic team from the first two features returned for the third Kid installment , and this was the cruel abomination that resulted . The script takes leave of reality at an early stage , and it all becomes increasingly daft and humourless with each scene . The Karate Kid Part III is a slickly produced adventure of the most simple-minded kind . Explores the challenges faced by the karate master and his young protege in Japan , his ancestral home . Part III , however , is not merely a disaster of the most uninspired contrivances but is actually unsuitable for youngsters , the series ' natural audience . Griffith 's over-the-top toxic-waste king [ is ] an unbelievably sadistic type who enjoys tilting his head back to laugh maniacally every three minutes or so , and who is one of few signs of life in this brain-dead movie . A bit of an improvement over the second installment , but so what ? The Karate Kid Part III is a brave but misguided attempt to restate the lesson through a narrative ploy that nearly always works , but here produces no more than recycling . A rather vicious melodrama and morality play that will bore most kids silly . 	Inspiration is in short supply in this third Karate Kid film , which recycles the basic narrative from its predecessors but adds scenery-chewing performances and a surprising amount of violence .
1184827-alvin and the chipmunks If the idea of three squeaky-voiced squirrels as pop gods makes you shudder , Alvin And The Chipmunks wo n't make you change your mind - but there 's enough spritely mischief in this flawed family comedy to provide some light-hearted fun . I went into this movie with expectations that could n't get much lower , but came out a fan of Alvin , Simon , and Theodore ... and Dave , for making us care about them as much as he does . Whatever residual affection you may harbor for the Chipmunks will vanish completely if you fork over good money to see this cheaply made and aggravatingly stupid movie . Will true love prevail ? Will Dave grow a backbone ( and some real songwriting talent ) ? And most important , will Alvin , Simon , and Theodore survive this bland new form of chipmunk mania ? They shoot rodents , do n't they ? Children may laugh at the broad humor , but what 's lurking underneath the comedy is dark and disheartening . There is one surprise -- it 's not as eye-gougingly awful as you might expect . It 's simply mediocre and immediately forgettable . When Lee 's finally called upon to yell the trademark 'Alllllvin ! ' it feels like a forced whimper that only reminds us how stale the decades-old material is . At least this film , based on classic characters , is bright and energetic , because it 's otherwise condescending , corny and utterly unfunny . The original recordings of Alvin were among the lowest moments in the history of popular culture . This soulless rehash , with its fart and poop jokes , proves that even one-note wonders can be diminished . Alvin , Theodore , and Simon have the only good lines or recognizable emotions , with Jason Lee and David Cross straining to flesh out their cardboard roles . 	Though cutely rendered , Alvin and the Chipmunks suffers from bland potty humor and a rehashed kids ' movie formula .
ever after a cinderella story 'Ever After ' presents a plucky Cinderella for today 's women and beyond . Drew Barrymore is delightful as Danielle , straightforward yet provocative , beautiful even when her face is smeared with the ashes from the fireplace . A frothy delight . Barrymore is the ideal revisionist Cinderella . There are some nice enhancements to the yarn , like the stepsisters not being particularly ugly ( one even turns out to be an ally ) , and the prince not wanting `` those certain obligations that come with privilege . '' One of the year 's best films . Barrymore aces her 16th-century elocution , but her vampy magnetism -- always her dominant charm -- is snuffed in this goody-goody role . Cinderella for the nineties . Cute and fairly witty . Ever After is a droll , uneven treatment of a familiar story that could become as popular with children as the 1950 Disney cartoon version . 	Ever After is a sweet , frothy twist on the ancient fable , led by a solid turn from star Barrymore .
bridge of spies Co-scripted by the Coen brothers and British writer Matt Charman , it is a consummately crafted , richly layered affair , with fine performances from Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance . The one hitch is that it is just too wholesome . In every single moment you feel like you 're in the hands of an absolute master of the cinematic form . Steven Spielberg reteaming with Tom Hanks and with help from the Coen Brothers and a great team has made a masterful film that ranks high on the list of anything he has ever done . Confirms that when it comes to historic dramas , Steven Spielberg is still the best . Re-invoking his 1990s reputation as the Baby Boomers ' James Stewart , Hanks gives good value as the increasingly furrow-browed Brooklyn insurance claims lawyer James B. Donovan . An absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they 're doing . A riveting , feel-good time for the whole family ... Hanks has never seemed more like a modern Jimmy Stewart , drink in hand , just looking to get home to his bed , as the script leans into its cavalcade of slightly bizarre negotiations with Eastern European goons . Entertaining and thought provoking , Bridge Of Spies gives real historical events a human face , and rates as a surprising crowd pleaser in the process . There are moments of pure genius , and scenes that miss their mark . The end result is a fine film , but not a major achievement . 	Bridge of Spies finds new life in Hollywood 's classic Cold War espionage thriller formula , thanks to reliably outstanding work from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks .
1057370-beloved While watching Beloved , I could easily see one of the best films of the year within , but it ultimately let me down in its penultimate moments . Unfortunately , this flick was so long , my spirit had long since left the building , enjoyed some smokes , played a round of golf , knocked back some brewskis , eaten a leisurely dinner , and slipped back into my body in time for the closing credits . Full of cathartic emotion and earnest dignity ! The core of Beloved is Winfrey 's brave , utterly convincing portrayal of the rough-hewn Sethe . Beloved has power and impressive artistry to spare ! Much of the acting is solid , but earnest performances ca n't give the picture all the bite and excitement it sorely needs . cathartic and affirming Has tough truths to tell about the differences between affection and possession , memory and nightmare , freedom and revenge -- truths that none of the performers involved shy away from . It 's heartfelt , praiseworthy and amazingly faithful to Toni Morrison 's complex Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ! Demme 's potent adaptation of Morrison 's novel may be substantial , but it is also engrossing . 	A powerful , emotional and successful film adaptation of the original novel .
dazed and confused Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good , this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s . An amazing film because of the way it perfectly captures the time period , and how it manages to carry so many characters and make every one of them interesting . Most films would be worthwhile if they could create one character as deep as these . Like the moustache sported by Matthew McCounaughey 's character , Dazed And Confused is sleazy , amusing and quite , quite awesome . Plenty of drug use with very little consequence . An affectionate but unsentimental recreation of suburban teen culture in the rock -- and pot -- drenched 70s . glorifies bullying and tries to balance it with pseudo-intellectual contemplation Classic Linklater high schooler story with great characters . Maybe the best movie ever made about American teenagers , casual and funny in a totally unique way . Imagine 'That 70 's Show . ' Now , imagine 'That 70 's Show ' if it was actually good . Linklater set out to make a film that was , in its own way , timeless , and the passing of years has only reinforced his against-the-odds success . 	Featuring an excellent ensemble cast , a precise feel for the 1970s , and a killer soundtrack , Dazed and Confused is a funny , affectionate , and clear-eyed look at high school life .
jauja A hallucinatory trip down the rabbit hole that summons memories of Gus Van Sant 's `` Gerry . '' If you miss 1980s-era Werner Herzog , see this . Experimental filmmaker Lisandro Alonso moves further toward narrative in the gorgeous , elusive Jauja with producer-composer Viggo Mortensen a dream figure at the center of a restlessly unfamiliar , even radical nineteenth-century Argentine Western . Intriguing , if opaque . It 's a puzzling head-tripper . An extremely enigmatic work that dangles possible meanings before viewers , who are forced to put their thinking caps on . Viewers who can accept a defiantly slow pace , a few loose plot threads and a directorial style that works by intimation , will be rewarded . With its richly saturated , meticulously composed sublime landscapes , this might be the year 's best-looking film . At its most powerful , Jauja suggests the surreal Western violence of Cormac McCarthy 's Blood Meridian in the way Alonso gradually folds the action into a waking nightmare . It is undoubtedly beautiful , brooding and enigmatic , with Mortensen 's grizzled presence holding the attention , but quite what it all means leaves you scratching your head in puzzlement . 	Jauja will prove haunting for those lured in by its deliberate pace and lovely visuals , though it may test some viewers ' patience .
batman begins ... the best comic-book superhero movie since the original X-Men , and that 's saying something The action sequences feel like generic studio product , frantically and confusingly edited , and the lengthy Batmobile chase scene feels like a good opportunity to take the kids to the bat-room . Holy gratuitous prequel , Batman ! Batman -- the grittiest and most intriguing of all classic comic book heroes -- has found new and improved life in the latest film version , Batman Begins , with Christian Bale as the best Dark Knight yet . A nonstarter . If Warner Brothers hoped that Nolan would reanimate the corpse of what should have been their most lucrative franchise , it has got its wish A great movie , the best of the summer and the year so far , assuring that the trend of comic-book-to-screen adaptation trend will not only continue , but continue vigorously . I have always been a Superman guy - after all , flying trumps rappelling , and heat vision can do more damage than a Batarang any day - but then came this new Batman movie . [ Batman Begins ] feels less like comic fantasy and more like serious drama , albeit one depicting the exploits of a psychotic ninja billionaire . Batman never once seems to be in real jeopardy ( though you can hardly tell from his voice , which makes it sound like he 's undergoing a perpetual colonoscopy ) . 	Brooding and dark , but also exciting and smart , Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes .
easier with practice Superbly directed , brillliantly written and featuring a terrific central performance from Brian Geraghty , this is a thoroughly engaging drama that packs a powerful emotional punch . An unexpectedly stirring first feature by Kyle Patrick Alvarez about the challenges of making human connections in the weird and wired 21st century . Easier With Practice is such an assured , solid and just plain good film , it 's going to be a tough act to follow . Geraghty 's wounded-pup appeal keeps the movie alive even as it heads for a dreary , even-more-implausible-than-the-setup third act . Writer-director Kyle Patrick Alvarez , though , usually finds the right tone and appears to have a promising future . What might sound like the set-up for a particularly bawdy Judd Apatow comedy is actually a deceptively sweet tale of twenty-first century alienation . [ Brian ] Geraghty anchors the film with a dedicated performance of sincere tenderness . Kyle Patrick Alvarez 's movie stands out as one the year 's as-yet-undiscovered gems . An engaging and moving tale . For any film , let alone a debut , to address difficult subjects with this much insight , humor , and humanity is almost miraculous . Love stories do n't come much squirmier than this one , and Alvarez plays it with honesty , insight , and the awkwardness inherent in this blindest of blind dates . 	This promising debut from writer-director Kyle Patrick Alvarez is anchored by a startlingly honest and tender performance from Brian Geraghty that helps make Easier with Practice more than just another road trip drama .
everything must go Everything can go . Sometimes it does go . The movie tells a pertinent story about what happens next . It 's a low-key movie that sneaks up on you gradually until , by the end , you realize you would n't mind spending more time with these characters . Ferrell fits uncannily well into Carver country , and in this small but sturdy film , he challenges any assumption that he might be limited to comedy . Certainly this is the first time he 's moved me to tears that were n't produced by hard laughter . Anyone who 's ever hit a low in their own lives can find inspiration in how Will Ferrell 's character overcomes obstacles and pulls himself up from rock bottom . After a strong first half , Everything Must Go ends up selling its leading man short . The result is a sad suburban pastoral , a strain of film you do n't see much of , or not enough ; it may feel somewhat stretched , and Rush 's additions to Carver barely push it past ninety minutes , but anything hectic or hasty would have spoiled the mood . It ca n't escape the crippling clichs of similar films that have come before it , and there are far too many Cameron Crowe-ian platitudes littered throughout the screenplay to remind us that we are indeed watching a movie . The big picture is famil iar -- busted middle-age man , suburban alcoholic despair -- yet the details are so finely rendered that the overall impression is potently strange . Will Ferrell plays a grown-up and proves maybe he should do it more often . It 's a nice change-up to see Will Ferrell starring in a straightforward drama . 	It may not improve on the Raymond Carver short story that inspired it , but Everything Must Go resists cliche and boasts a pair of magnetic performances from the perfectly cast Ferrell and Wallace .
talk to her I found it slow to get into . But I hung in there and am glad I did because eventually it grabbed me and I ended up enjoying it . Somewhere along the line , critics , even the good ones , started to adore Pedro Almodovar with wide-eyed lenses ; having never washed them since -- arguably [ Almodovar 's ] finest film to date . Compelling , engaging and thought-provoking , with superb work in front of and behind the camera . Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . There are lots of odd sequences that add texture ( abstract ballet sequences , an extended silent movie scene that goes very surreal ) , and so much going on beneath the surface that you can hardly take it all in . It 's another wild yet thoughtful look at the meaning of life and sexuality from Almodovar . It 's a melancholy film , but with wry , comic touches . Pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . Occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional Almodvar style . 	Another masterful , compassionate work from Pedro Almodovar .
moonrise kingdom The usual complaints and caveats about Anderson - he 's precious , his characters have no grounding in the real world - can be made about Moonrise Kingdom , but so what ? Wes Anderson 's films are stylistic carbon copies of each other , merely swapping out storylines and characters . It 's like going to a bunch of different restaurants and ordering the exact same meal -- you walk in knowing what you 're going to get . As per the director 's norm , the film offers a triumph of style over substance . But sometimes , when it 's not just typical summertime bombast , that 's what you need . Anderson has trouble sticking the landing , but `` Moonrise Kingdom '' is in many ways the most satisfying flight he 's taken us on in years . It 's an adventure , a love story , a biblical allegory complete with approaching storm , a mash note to composer Benjamin Britten and a profoundly touching discourse on the needs of troubled children . I liked this one because of its young performers , the evocative island setting ( filmed in Rhode Island ) , Alexandre Desplat 's lovely score and Robert Yeoman 's slightly grainy cinematography . A whimsical tale about a different kind of storm - adolescence before adulthood . Anderson aficionados are bound to warm to Moonrise Kingdom . Non-fans may take more persuading , but should enjoy themselves in the end . Wes Anderson 's fanciful , heartfelt tale of two 12-year-old runaways will delight his fans and may even win some converts among those who 've resisted his hermetic style . Endlessly subjective to the kids ' fantasy of the world around them , a memory in mind compacted from impressions half-glimpsed , Anderson confects and even perfects a headlong heaven's-to-Etsy esthetic , in hothouse glory . 	Warm , whimsical , and poignant , the immaculately framed and beautifully acted Moonrise Kingdom presents writer/director Wes Anderson at his idiosyncratic best .
the invisible war Dick 's films often strut with a lilting impudence , but his new work is dead-serious , as suits the subject . Addressing a rarely discussed social problem , Kirby 's shocking docu could function as an agent of real change . One of those documentaries that you watch both fascinated and repulsed - and one of those films that you sense just might be instrumental in helping to change an utterly unacceptable status quo . There 's a sense that Dick would rather be effective than fair , but The Invisible War wants to tear down walls , and sometimes a sledgehammer comes in handy . A disquieting investigative essential documentary that sheds light on the massive problem of rape and the systemic cover-ups in the US military . Agonizing , infuriating - and effective . I have rarely been more righteously riled up than I was while watching the documentary The Invisible War . `` The Invisible War '' makes all too clear that the military is n't very good at justice . This eye-opening documentary turns a glaring spotlight on sex crimes in the American armed forces , and on the military establishment 's astonishing insensitivity to the issue . The Invisible War , though revelatory , is perhaps the most straightforward film yet from a director who likes to broach the fault lines of sex and society . 	The Invisible War is a vital and frank expose on sexual assault in the U.S. military , shot by master filmmaker Kirby Dick ( This Film is Not Yet Rated ) .
turtles can fly Ghobadi has little use for sentimentality , and never flinches from the fate of these children . ... painful , despair-filled film . A welcome , even essential adjustment to the images of Iraq seen in daily news reports . Director Bahman Ghobadi takes us into the day-to-day despair of youngsters pinned down by war and poverty . Una pelcula conmovedora , sugestiva y potica , donde gran parte de la conviccin proviene de sus increbles actores no profesionales . A deceptively modest and extraordinarily moving picture . Ghobadi magically transforms modern-day Kurdistan into a grotesque wonderland and the raw material of the bloody conflicts in Iraq into a fairy tale that is tragic , haunting and often oddly beautiful . Further proof that Ghobadi is one of those great artists that comes forth during his people 's time of crisis . One of the most heartbreaking , unforgettable dramas in years . A lyrical and heartbreaking reminder of the human toll of war . 	Set in Iraq after the fall of Saddam , Turtles Can Fly is being hailed as extraordinary , moving , and lyrical .
trials of henry kissinger Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . A compelling film . Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up . Fascinating to watch as a portrait of political celebrity and ego . Like the best 60 Minutes expos , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . Scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves . And they do n't speak kindly . Both damning and damned compelling . provocative study Whether you buy Hitchens ' arguments , one leaves The Trials of Henry Kissinger seeing him as a man who viewed international diplomacy as a game , blithely ignoring the human toll of his gamesmanship . ... the implication is Kissinger may have decided that - when it comes to truncheoning - it 's better to give than to receive . 	This compelling unauthorized biography takes a muckraker 's view of the controversial diplomat .
infernal affairs Cop thrillers do n't come much more polished , or enjoyable , than Infernal Affairs . It 's hard to resist the charismatic teaming of Tony Leung and Andy Lau as a cop and a criminal wearing like hats for cross purposes . [ D ] iabolically clever ... the apotheosis of the Hong Kong police thriller ... Even when the film is in danger of getting bogged down in its own complications , the hard-boiled poetry of its images is arresting . Infernal Affairs is the combustible Hong Kong fever dream that would emerge from a night spent watching Heat and Donnie Brasco back to back . Recalls classics like Serpico and The French Connection , but features a contemporary sophistication and of-the-moment vivacity that sets it apart . It 's amazing there have n't been a dozen movies like it . It 's a cop movie that 's constantly trying to convince you it 's not just a cop movie This intense , explosive Hong Kong thriller ushers in a new era of hyper-intelligent action . Ranks at the top of the list of the best action dramas to emerge from Hong Kong since the glory days of John Woo . 	Smart and engrossing , this is one of Hong Kong 's better cop thrillers .
my life without me Too flat and confined and false . Sarah Polley exudes a steadfast joie-de-vivre that ultimately won me over . insulting and irritating Silly , dull and depressing . Ann ... would be a cruel egocentric if she were n't so obviously just a fictional pawn . A gigantically amoral cliche of a film . Makes you think twice about what 's really important in life and a movie that can do that is a movie worth seeing . ( ... ) Una de las pelculas ms hermosas que se hayan filmado sobre eso tan extrao y tan temido que es el tiempo que queda antes de morir . Despite some initial misgivings , My Life Without Me wound up breaking down my resistance . Sarah Polley 's performance is exquisite , with shades of complexity flickering across her face as she absorbs the information her doctor has given her : confusion , disbelief , then determination . 	Sarah Polley keeps this production afloat with her moving performance .
show me love This lively comedy should strike a chord with bored teenagers everywhere . The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth . I 'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out . A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just is n't enough to make it compelling . Surprisingly poignant and unflinchingly honest . Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches . It 's worth going out of your way to witness one of the year 's best films . El ttulo original ( en los EUA se exhibi bajo el nombre de Show Me Love ) es llamativo : Fucking ml no slo sugiere indirectamente el sexo ... A simple , charming , and slightly edgy romance between two teenage girls . High school , small town , teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven ? Written and directed by Moodysson with charm , a sense of fun and no condescension . 	A naturalistic depiction of teenage life , Show Me Love has a charming , authentic feel .
batman returns Bigger , better and more sophisticated than the first outing . About the only thing it had going for it was Pfeiffer in a catsuit , stiletto heels , with a whip . Wowsers . [ Burton 's ] dark , melancholy vision is undeniably something to see , but it is a claustrophobic conception , not an expansive one , oppressive rather than exhilarating , and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying . Batman Returns , though , is full of grim , Dostoyevskian undertones , not to mention a multitude of bloody , violent scenes . Something about the filmmaker 's eccentric , surreal , childlike images seems to strike a deep chord in the mass psyche : he makes nightmares that taste like candy . Of all the Batman pictures , this is the most striking , atmospheric and effective . A bizarre mixture of poetic brilliance and clumsy ineptitude . If Christopher Nolan never decided to direct a Batman movie , 'Batman Returns ' would easily reign as the best film starring the Caped Crusader . Burton uses the summer 's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams . O design de produo inspirado e Keaton busca conferir peso dramtico ao heri , mas o roteiro pedestre e Pingim jamais se torna um vilo interessante . Por outro lado , a sensualidade de Pfeiffer quase redime o filme . Quase . 	Director Tim Burton 's dark , brooding atmosphere , Michael Keaton 's work as the tormented hero , and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as , well , Christopher Walken make the sequel better than the first .
gremlins Great fun . An enchanting yet savagely funny movie , Gremlins belongs alongside Ghostbusters as an enduring mainstream masterpiece from the summer of 1984 . Just do n't watch it after midnight . There was a kid who went to my high school who looked exactly like Gizmo . Thus , we called him 'Gizmo . ' It appealed enormously to its target audience because it 's just the kind of violence kids would like to get away with if they had no consciences nor fear of adults at all . There is satire here : a sense of silly but thoughtful consideration on the Christmas traditions and how easily all the relatable facades crumble as a consequence of simple illusions being so easily shattered . A tribute the 1950s matinee genre , Gremlins never eases up on the action or its sense of suspense . A wildly original roller-coaster ride of hilarious mischief . The humans are little more than dress-extras for the mechanics . Dante is perhaps the first filmmaker since Frank Tashlin to base his style on the formal free-for-all of animated cartoons ; he is also utterly heartless . Joe Dante 's most successful film , like William Castle crossed with Looney Tunes . 	Whether you choose to see it as a statement on consumer culture or simply a special effects-heavy popcorn flick , Gremlins is a minor classic .
hannah arendt I really like this film . I like the milieu that 's created of this intellectual life in New York during the 1950s . I think Sukowa is fantastic in the role . Forceful portrayal by Sukowa humanizes an intellectual whose persona is remembered as grim as her philosophical observations . . . without her key controversial claims . Arendt , through the film 's glamorizing lens , becomes a character impossible not to identify or agree with . A crisply measured character study with plenty of intriguing ideas , elevated by a terrific , finely calibrated performance by Sukowa . A trivial take on a profound thinker . A fascinating character study of an arrogant , cold-hearted , self-hating Jew who had the nerve to blame 6,000,000 of her own people for their extermination in concentration camps . The period is subtly rendered and the climactic defence of her ideas before a class of students and critics is a stirring and thought-provoking coda . Thinker and writer adds an intellectual footnote to the Holocaust [ Barbara Sukowa ] invests Arendt with a steely fury , but the film , set during and after the 1961 trial of ex -- Nazi official Adolf Eichmann , has an entertaining cocktail-banter superficiality . Barbara Sukowa delivers a beautifully modulated performance , showing the rigor of Arendt 's thought and convictions while revealing the contours of a passionate woman with complex relationships . 	Led by a powerful performance from Barbara Sukowa , Hannah Arendt does a commendable job of dramatizing the life of a complex public figure .
sleepwalk with me 2012 Birbiglia has an affable screen presence , and there 's an appealing authenticity to the characters and their relationships . Mike Birbiglia adeptly navigates the comic , self-mocking confessional terrain . This is unquestionably the funniest movie you 'll ever see about a doomed relationship coupled with a life-threatening sleep-disorder . An endearing indie feature about the day-to-day indecisions and nocturnal perambulations of a commitment-phobic New Yorker . Walking a fine line between darkly compassionate comedy , biting reality , striking low-budget fantasy and harsh psychological honesty , this modest but most disarming offering from funnyman Birbiglia is one of those pics that unexpectedly grows on you . This sharp romantic comedy began as a one-man show , and you can tell : the hero 's voice-over narration wraps around the entire movie , and the scenes are mainly verbal . The movie is so good that if you were n't a fan of Mike Birbiglia beforehand , you will be afterwards . As entertaining as the movie can be , it 's the smaller , more poignant material in between the big laughs that makes the final product so charming . The real find , above all else , is Mike Birbiglia himself . He 's as sure of a natural in front of the camera as he is behind it . A riotous breakthrough for Mike Birbiglia , whose humanist comedy says a lot about modern relationships that many of us wo n't be prepared to admit . 	Laugh-out-loud funny and endearingly messy , Sleepwalk with Me overcomes its tonal inconsistencies to deliver a sweetly melancholic , amiably reassuring indie crowd-pleaser .
three burials of melquiades estrada A safe , satisfying drama steeped in classic notions of loyalty and friendship . Like Richard Farnsworth , L. Q. Jones or even Steve McQueen in his later performances , Jones ' world-weary western masculinity transcends `` movie acting . '' Intriguingly structured , beautifully shot and superbly acted Western - this is one of the highlights of the year . one of those offbeat dramas that would never have gotten produced without the clout of a major star behind it . ... a challenging , unpredictable film that never allows the audience to get too comfortable . This gripping film about real people is well-worth excavating . Three Burials still reaches the kind of pungency it seems to be seeking , and it touches on issues of alienation and distance very relevant to the reality of countless migrants . `` The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada '' is rugged and quiet , absurd and humourous . Funny , tough , filled with cut-to-the-bone moments and bleached in the heat of the Texas sun , The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a movie that sears itself into the viewer with uncompromising vision and stark approach . As 'Brokeback Mountain ' and now 'Burials ' demonstrate , filmmakers continue to find usefulness and meaning in the mythology and iconography of that most American ( and masculine ) of self-critiques , the Western . A beautifully written and acted mini-epic about life and death , although it might be somewhat enigmatic for many viewers . 	Tommy Lee Jones ' directorial debut is both a potent western and a powerful morality tale .
paranorman Kids who can handle the bumps should find much to love in this beautifully animated ramshackle parcel , one that 's packed full of detail , humour and positive messages . The look of the film is great , and the anti-bullying message works . This would be a fantastic introduction to scary movies for the kids . Good movie but a horror movie for children ought to be more fun . Kids also like creepy and missing is that nice dash of the willies they love so much . An entertaining and visually attractive family-friendly story . Simply put , it is no less than the most confident , fully realized , and just plain imaginative stop-motion animated feature since 1993 's holiday classic `` The Nightmare Before Christmas . '' Tweens , rather than children , will savour its snarky bite , although like the shambling on-screen cadavers , the story needed a bit more meat on its bones . Movies that set themselves firmly against bullying are great , but ones that play to horror fans are even better . This is the kind of grim fairy tale , equal parts midnight-movie macabre and family-round-the-hearth compassionate , that scars in all the right ways . Spooky story about an adolescent medium 's morbid `` Sixth-Sense '' encounters ... perhaps it should be PG-10 , not PG . What 's truly marvelous about the stop-motion fantasia ParaNorman is the way it acknowledges adolescence as a daily horror show . 	Beautifully animated and solidly scripted , ParaNorman will entertain ( and frighten ) older children while providing surprisingly thoughtful fare for their parents .
1213718-did you hear about the morgans There 's a scene where Hugh Grant confronts a grizzly bear and I 've never rooted so hard for a predatory mammal . Considering how rarely Grant works , you 'd expect genuine excellence in the scripts he picks . We 'd expected more than this merely serviceable , not very believable Hollywood romcom . With less edge than soup , Did You Hear About the Morgans ? is a proud , plain , rom com . Did you hear about Did You Hear About the Morgans ? Really , you do n't want to . Neither good nor bad . Scales dizzying new heights of okay . Aims for mediocrity ... and nails it . Potro % u0161eni Hugh Grant i antipati % u010Dna izvedba S.J . Parker u komediji koja je trebala biti slasher horror This fish out of water rom-com is predictable and sappy but the contrast between New York and Wyoming , filmed with fine production values , makes for some interest . Parental Content Review Not even the estimable comic chops of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker can lift it above the level of ordinary . Grant and Parker ... are so boringly civil that there must have been a marriage guidance counsellor standing just out of shot . 	It gets a certain amount of mileage out of the inherent likability of its stars , but with an unfunny script and a lack of onscreen chemistry , Did You Hear About the Morgans ? falls flat .
queen of earth Every beautiful , resonant image in writer-director Alex Ross Perry 's film is fraught with neurotic , diaphanous riddles . Perry 's movie may not be easy to watch , but that does n't mean you should n't . It 's a midnight movie that turns out to be a Rainer Werner Fassbinder chamber drama . This is vigorous , frightening , electrifying stuff . Even minor Perry outclasses most contemporary majors . Anchored by incredible performances from Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston , this is one of the most mesmerizing pictures of the year . Well made , written , acted and crafted , it 's the sort of movie that does n't go down easy , takes no prisoners and leaves you hoping your own life will never resemble theirs . `` Queen of Earth '' is n't a laugh riot , not by a long shot . But it is a good movie , and a fascinating study of descent . A standout star turn from Elisabeth Moss enlivens and deepens Alex Ross Perry 's extended Roman Polanski homage . It is a character study of a woman 's decent into madness that is not a pretty picture but a potent one . The film is n't a thriller per se , but it has the tension and atmosphere of one , only with emotional violence substituting for the physical kind . 	Led by a searing performance from Elisabeth Moss , Queen of Earth is a demanding -- and ultimately rewarding -- addition to writer-director Alex Ross Perry 's impressive filmography .
to sir with love The charisma of Poitier and the energetic performances of a groovy-looking cast of high school hellcats ( some of whom look like they 've repeated year 12 at least 5 times ) compensate for the shortcomings . Good performances elevate the material . Sidney Poitier is a beleaguered English teacher in this multi-cultural Mr. Chips Incessant Cockney street market vignettes and shots of London buses seem to suggest that it was all primarily intended for American consumption anyway . Well-meaning tripe . One factor in the picture 's popularity and its sustaining charm is the tuneful title song , which was a top hit for Lulu and is heard throughout the film . Sydney Poitier at his best ; teens and up . Generally effective comedy drama with standout performances . The film has gone in and out of fashion , but it 's old enough now to return to it with a clear eye , and see the strength beneath the kooky sentimentality . Sidney Poitier stars in an excellent performance . 	While it 's a bit dated and overly schmaltzy , To Sir , With Love remains compelling because of Sidney Poitier 's outstanding performance -- and the catchy theme song is a classic .
walk hard Knocked up hurriedly , you feel , in between Apatow 's other projects , Walk Hard is the feted writer-producer 's first fumble . As Spinal Tap 's Nigel Tufnel might have put it , this one only goes to two-and-a-half . The one area where 'Walk Hard ' does manage to hold its own against classics of the genre such as 'This is Spinal Tap ' or 'Sweet and Lowdown ' is the music , all of which is expertly written and performed . Raunchy , often hysterical parody of overplayed musical biopics ironically sags just when its targets do but hits several right notes thanks to the sturdy presence of John C. Reilly as a none-too-subtle riff on the Man in Black . It 's a one-man show telling one-joke , but it 's a damn talented man and it 's a pretty funny joke . I 'm glad the artform that Zucker-Abahams-Zucker brought us in the 1980 's survives . It 's gotten raunchier , meaner , maybe rougher , but it lives on . This gleeful skewering of American popular music works because of the talents of director Jake Kasdan and a cast led by John C. Reilly . Offers a few inspired moments in a sea of mediocre gags , fumbled opportunities and that great foul among contemporary comedies -- unnecessary grossness . For all of the care and creativity put into Walk Hard 's original songs , the rest of the film feels less inspired and maybe a little lazy . Walk Hard is a disposable film that offers its share of small pleasures and amusements . Reilly is well-cast in this hit-and-miss spoof of both rock singers and American social history from 1950 on . 	A parody that pokes fun at rock stars and reductive biopics alike , this comedy sings in large part because of stellar performances and clever original music .
dukes of hazzard ... neither the frantic slapstick nor the we-don't- know-what- to-do-so- let's-have- another-car-chase sequences alter the movie 's gear-grinding desperation . Haws follow hees as hayseeds rip around in fast cars , churning dust and making faces very close to the camera . Comes reasonably close to [ being ] finger-licking good . I could barely make out a word of the 'dialogue ' them there Duke boys kept a-hollerin ' over the roar of the General Lee and their movie 's soundtrack of ineptly edited swamp rock . There were two big boobs I wanted to see in this movie , and they were n't Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott . It 's every bit as bad as you thought it 'd be . Only worse . Do n't bother with this movie . If you 're just itching for more Dukes , stick to the original series on DVD . Amazing . Incredible . Unbelievable . Astonishing . Painful . All these words come to mind in just the first 10 minutes of viewing this film , none of them in a good way . A series of rowdy antics instead of a sustained storyline , The Dukes of Hazzard is all about the car . Straight viewing could result in brain damage . 	A dumb , goofy , and vacuous adaptation of a TV show where plot is simply an excuse to string together the car chases .
good hair In chronicling the permutations of black hair , the filmmaker ends up making a breezy statement on the universality of narcissism . Rock is our quick-witted empathetic guide in the film about black women 's hair , a topic you might think would be of interest only to black women . You 'd be wrong . Part of the fun here is the way our narrator gets at complicated questions in his characteristically glib way . ... [ But ] real answers will have to be teased out elsewhere . Good Hair is n't selling anything but a good time . Good Hair stands as an informative and entertaining documentary , and one that 's pulled off with no small measure of style . Hair-larious ! A wise and wacky dye-laughing doc about black female high maintenance hair that is no laughing matter , the movie finds a PG-13 Rock channeling Michael Moore , while nearly tumbling into a jumbo vat of processor goo . A generally superb model of how to make a pop documentary Rock sheds new light on this old story through a poignant mix of interviews , investigation and his trademark satire . Rock takes his Good Hair job as a documentarian seriously enough to be interesting , but not so seriously that the film groans with earnestness . Rock takes aim at the truth and humor of this potent cultural question with a sharp wit and lively curiousity , even if he does n't pursue vigorously enough its uglier side . 	Funny , informative , and occasionally sad , Good Hair is a provocative look at the complex relationship between African Americans and their hair .
catwoman Catwoman is almost unbelievably dumb . Me-ouch ! This is going to hurt Halle Berry 's reputation as a serious actress . The main question to ask is why did we need this project ? It 's a Spiderman ripoff , where commerical artist is bitten by a radioactive ***** ... okay , breathed on by the Egyptian cat goddess Bescht . Same damn thing ! The haphazardly cut-together action scenes have been 'enhanced ' with laughably bad digital effects ; you could find screen savers with better animation . If one good thing can come out of this film , it 's that this should provide an everlasting blueprint for what not to do with a comic book film . It 's bad enough that not only are careers over , but somebody should be slapped . A movie needs more than a few sexual innuendos and throaty purrs to keep us from taking a catnap . Bereft of excitement and with action scenes similar to those we 've seen a dozen times before , this is a very poor effort indeed . Poor special effects ( with weak echoes of better superhero outings such as Spider-Man ) and an uneven central performance contribute to what was one of the flop blockbusters of 2004 . 	Halle Berry is the lone bright spot , but even she ca n't save this laughable action thriller .
ne le dis a personne Canny , refreshingly emotional and intuitive thriller . never comes to grips with its standard-issue plot mechanics , delivering neither the icy thriller that its cool detachment edges towards , nor the pulse-quickening potboiler that its story would seem to demand . Sews us tightly into a story that not only challenges the brain but engages the heart . It 's refreshing to see a thriller in which all of this information makes sense , falling into place as pieces of a coherent puzzle . Tell No One is a thoroughly absorbing whodunit with more twists and switchbacks than the Le Mans racecourse . An intricate , intelligent , and very watchable thriller . The sometimes confused story % u2013 with so many players , a who 's who checklist is needed to keep things clear % u2013 is aided with the oft-thrilling chases that punctuate the film . It becomes an intriguing game of chess with each of the players making moves we ca n't always follow but in which we 're always interested . It 's a murder mystery , but the murder ( indeed , murders ) is not what it seems . You 'll leave wondering why Hollywood ca n't seem to make a romantic thriller so simply satisfying . Even when Tell No One 's story gets a bit too convoluted for its own good , the cinematography , the acting and especially the action will keep you glued to the screen . 	An intense , well-crafted thriller , Tell No One is equal parts heart-pounding and heart-wrenching .
men in black iii While they probably needed the decade-long gap between films to make us forget MIB2- this third installment is actually quite decent . Sonnenfeld strikes a rich vein of comedy in production designer Bo Welch 's imagining of the MIB in the 1960s . There 's a zippy and clever movie going on all around the two lumps with their names above the title . Whilst MIB III wraps up the series neatly , there 's talk of a fourth already and you ca n't help but feel the joke is wearing a little thin . It 's better than the first one . Sonnenfeld wisely plays to the strengths of the series ' longevity , drawing some genuine emotion out of the buddy routine between slick-talking J and granite-faced K High action , slick humor , raucous fun , MIB 3 is also a surprisingly thoughtful paean to the higher implications of pie , and to the miracle of chance that makes up the unified fabric of the past , present , and future . It 's bright and cheerful and , in a hokey third act twist , generically sweet . The oversized sci-fi fantasy , the super cool weaponry , the ultra cool humour , the adrenaline rush of action ( and those iconic sunglasses ) that have spawned millions of fans is back . In this age of blockbuster bloat , Sonnenfeld 's willingness to wrap things up well before the two-hour mark , as well as his eschewal of sledgehammer product placement , count as gestures of considerable mercy . 	It is n't exactly a persuasive argument for the continuation of the franchise , but Men in Black III is better than its predecessor and manages to exceed expectations .
1124859-grind Will mostly be remembered as the wasted first starring role in the hopefully lengthy career of the very , very talented Adam Brody . Breezily unmemorable and not nearly as raucous as it thinks it is , Grind hits all the usual buttons A crass , condescending piece of corporate bamboozling . Alas , the great teen-skateboarding comedy has still yet to be made . Attempts to combine the extreme sports visuals of a good Warren Miller ski film with the plot of a bad Tom Green picture and does n't come close to landing on four wheels . If you stay awake , you 'll certainly feel more than a little ground down after watching perhaps 15 minutes of skateboard footage padded out with nearly 90 minutes of strenuously unfunny toilet humor . It 's the sort of movie that makes American Wedding look ... subtle by comparison . [ T ] his summer 's notorious bomb Gigli is starting to look better and better . Your standard 'kids on the road pursuing their dream ' movie , interchangeable with any other . No standout bits , but very little stands out as not working at all , so you 're in that safe zone of joyful mediocrity . It 's a comedy filled with non-star actors , a sloppy story and misfired humor . Truly a mess , technically speaking , and appears to have been edited by Stevie Wonder . 	Mediocre skateboard stunts are padded by a half-baked plot and one-dimensional characters .
due-date For all its supposed comedy , there 's very little joy in Due Date . Due Date is just like 'Planes , Trains and Automobiles ' but without the humor and heart . There is something comically symmetrical about Downey as an expectant dad rehearsing fatherhood with the overgrown boy and Galifianakis as the fatherless son who adopts Downey as his surrogate dad . It 's bad enough that it took four screenwriters to ineptly rehash Planes , Trains and Automobiles , but it 's even worse that they 've only managed to come up with one new joke each . I Think the Movie Lost me When Robert Downey Jr punched out a ten-year old . The odyssey of Downey and Galifianakis is composed of far too many sharp edges and far too little warmth . Phillips shows tremendous ability in the film 's first hour , but he still needs to shed off more of the clichs and gross-out stunts In its best moments , the film 's duo of Galifianakis and Downey Jr. remind us of a bickering Laurel & Hardy digging themselves out of another fine mess . And we 're happy to be along for the ride . Downey and Galifianakis make for a truly marvelous collision of opposites , and their interplay is what elevates 'Due Date ' above its often puzzlingly flat material . Too bad that Phillips and his team of screenwriters do n't take full advantage of the stars ' unique chemistry . 	Shamelessly derivative and only sporadically funny , Due Date does n't live up to the possibilities suggested by its talented director and marvelously mismatched stars .
the conjuring Better-than-average demon movie goes bump in the night Wan 's latest exercise in jump-scare theatre ... better to call it `` The Startling '' . Wan 's hair raising methodical pace steers us through a supernatural thriller drenched in tension , and featuring scenes of horror that will sear itself in the mind and come back to haunt you in your nightmares . `` The Conjuring '' depends more on its excellent cast and atmospheric direction than cheap gimmicks to raise hairs on the back of your neck . Which it does , quite frequently . `` The Conjuring '' wants Dan and Lorraine to seem like Indiana Jones-style hunters of the supernatural , but in this basic jolt-provider , they 're as fascinating as the Jersey Devil . What director James Wan does in `` The Conjuring '' is employ old-fashioned shocks - things that bump in the night , insinuations of nefarious spirits , even a furniture-banging exorcism - in creative and ultimately terrifying ways . Wan builds mounting dread with silence and suspense , lingering the camera unsettlingly long here , creaking a door there . Delivers a steady stream of fist-clenching suspense and well-choreographed surprises . As an exercise in classical scare tactics , delivered through an escalating series of primo setpieces , The Conjuring is often supremely effective . It 's not one of these one-note horror flicks hoping to make you jump ; this KNOWS how scary it is and will get you by the end . 	Well-crafted and gleefully creepy , The Conjuring ratchets up dread through a series of effective old-school scares .
fighting Yes , both Channing Tatum and Zulay Henao ... have careers for their looks alone , and they 'd have better careers delivering pizza than delivering dialogue . Like a poor man 's Fight Club , Fighting is hardly a heavyweight . But with an enjoyable performance from Terrence Howard , the film is no disaster . The audience are left with something in the middle-not enough brains , not enough brawn , and , most importantly , NOT ENOUGH RUDDY FIGHTING . All of this , however , is plainly just a veneer on a solidly generic punch-up movie , and it thus becomes a drag . A more cartoonish approach would probably have been more fun . `` Fighting '' seems like a no-brainer project for Dito Montiel that he needed to get out of his system before he can move back into an emotionally rarefied world as complex as that of his first film . The first rule of fight flicks ? For God 's sake , do n't be boring . If you need an actor to look good in an underground street fight , hire Channing Tatum . Rock musician-turned-director Dito Montiel fails to make much of a fist with his second feature , Fighting , though he deserves points for trying to add some contemporary New York City grit . By making good use of its New York setting , Montiel does bring a certain indie grit to the generic story . Though by no means original or especially ambitious , Fighting turns out to be a surprisingly watchable B-movie . 	Though Fighting has a likable lead performer , and the fight scenes are impressive , the paper-thin plot ultimately unravels .
playing by heart The brightest spot belongs to Angelina Jolie , who is so compelling to watch she has chemistry with the furniture . Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery head the cast as a mature couple approaching their 40th wedding anniversary , and they 're so superb together that it 's a wonder no one ever thought of teaming them before . Carroll 's characters spend so much time talking , albeit intelligently , that the connections they make seem peculiarly synthetic . A heavily mixed bag ; high points come with Jon Stewart 's sweet courtship of Gillian Anderson and a brilliant turn from a young unknown named Angelina Jolie . The performers have charm even when their material gets hollow or silly , cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond gives Los Anegeles a bright , colourful look , and plenty of snappy dialogue and good tunes are on offer . Unfortunately as bland as its forgettable title , An underrated , dreamy drama about love , lust and infidelity amongst inter-connected Los Angeleans . Jolie rises to the challenge . There was a lot for me to like in this film , but I felt it did n't really add up to much ... An always-entertaining and fairly thoughtful film on the subject of love , and how everyone hopes for it in one way or another . Everyone has his or her moment , although it is the older folks ( Connery and Rowlands ) and the youngsters ( Jolie and Phillippe ) who come off best , giving affecting performances in roles that serve as generational bookends in the film . 	It 's overly talky , but Playing By Heart benefits from witty insights into modern relationships and strong performances from an esteemed cast .
1110288-count of monte cristo Plum and peachy entertainment . A preposterous , expansive and self-conscious attempt to resurrect the historical spectacular . It trusts the story it sets out to tell . Solid , unpretentious , thoroughly competent film ... The new version takes liberties with the story but uses them wisely to add excitement . The bottom line is that this movie is well worth a $ 3.00 video rental but not necessarily a $ 7.00 ticket price . A good story with solid acting . ... in a marketplace littered with films that studios have unloaded to make a buck or two ... `` The Count of Monte Cristo '' stands out like a treasure chest half-buried in the sand . The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . Solid , matinee-style entertainment that 's fun while it lasts . 	Though it may not reach for any new artistic heights , The Count of Monte Cristo is an old-fashioned yet enjoyable swashbuckler .
the counterfeiters 2007 El resultado es notable , tanto como inquietante y hasta quizs incmoda reflexin sobre el instinto de supervivencia del ser humano , y tambin como pieza cinematogrfica . The fresh perspective and challenging moral questions make for a historical drama with vital relevance to contemporary audiences . Ruzowitsky 's film , austerely shot and scripted with terse wit , grants itself a licence to make art in exchange for entertaining us with a gripping story . Based on actual events , this is a dramatic war movie that shows the inner conflict at work in a group of prisoners stuck in an ethical quandary over how the cost of their survival might cause the deaths of many others . A bold study of unbearable moral ambiguity . Ruzowitzky 's faux-doc shaky-cam zooms are less about the banality of evil than the inappropriateness of style . Full of the weird details that , though unsurprising on one level , are so jarringly wrong that they seem fresh . It is a must-see , especially in this dreary movie season . ... an honest effort to sound painful human depths . Plays the concentration camp drama to dynamic effect . 	The Counterfeiters is a gripping account of one prisoner 's moral dilemma , superbly portrayed by Karl Markovics .
fourth kind Ultimately , the film 's narrative segments are far too glossy and over-stylized , larded with ponderous scoring , obvious melodrama and split-screen visuals that offset the `` reenactments '' with the `` real . '' proves that a horror film does n't need splashy digital effects or pyrotechnics to be effective Liable to disappear mysteriously from cinemas . Who knew alien abduction could be such a bore ? ... a thriller that unravels easily even if it nevertheless occasionally qualifies as a scary good time . Olatunde Osunsnmi has created something incredibly original that can be debated and discussed endlessly regardless of whether you accept everything in his film as real or faked or a little bit of both . Such originality as Osunsanmi 's usually wins me over , but his artificial realism here leaves me cold -- like taking a stroll on a Nome sidewalk , in winter , without a parka . Unintentionally , laughably bad . It 's a well crafted docu-drama-esque film that takes itself seriously , builds tension and scares the sh*t out of you through and through . The release date is not the fault of the movie . 	While it boasts a handful of shocks , The Fourth Kind is hokey and clumsy and makes its close encounters seem eerily mundane .
true romance It plays out like candied noir , with a classic dialogue scene at least once every ten minutes . One of the most dynamic action films of the 1990s . True Romance , despite not displaying Tarantino at his best , is still a Tarantino film and it delivers the goods to all those who expect some stylish entertainment . Bombards the audience with images of blazing guns , brutal beatings , and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale . If the romance seldom seems 'true ' , the spiralling violence ( script , Quentin Tarantino ) does succeed , in a brutish , cod-Jacobean kind of way . The only thing that goes wrong with the movie is Christian Slater ... the failure of its central character ends up being an irritation , but not a film-crippling problem . Overrated , but still quite a bit of fun . If you 're in the mood for this sort of absurd , violent nonsense ... True Romance does deliver . Fast , Fun and Fantastically performed ... .One hot little movie God I wish I had written this movie . 	Fueled by Quentin Tarantino 's savvy screenplay and a gallery of oddball performances , Tony Scott 's True Romance is a funny and violent action jaunt in the best sense .
taxi driver Do n't let the endless barrage of morons imitating the `` You talkin ' to me ? '' bit put you off . It 's a powerful film and a terrific showcase for the versatility of star Robert De Niro . So much of this study of evil is brilliant . One of the great ones Portrait of a very disturbed man ; NOT for kids . If you have n't seen Taxi Driver , your education in film has n't even begun . An undeniably brilliant , nightmarish portrait of one man 's personal hell . [ Scorsese ] seems to need scripts with well-designed humor and performers with the spirit of Ellen Burstyn to compensate for what seems to be a fundamentally depressed view of life and the belief that sobriety is the equivalent of seriousness . One of the best and most powerful of all films . The heart and soul of Taxi Driver are twisted in a way that ca n't be faked or copied . 	A must-see film for movie lovers , this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling , with Robert De Niro at his best .
battle royale 3d Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences . A modern classic about the folly of violence . As twisted as it sounds , killing off 41 teens takes a great deal of creativity and an innate sense of pacing in order to avoid , well , cinematic boredom . The basic storyline just is n't very good , and any attempt to say anything meaningful or moving is ham-fisted and obvious , which quite simply is n't good enough for a film as in-your-face as this . Awful deaths ( and hysterical reactions to them ) punctuate declarations of love and friendship , revelations of treachery and heavily armed expressions of angst . A wonderfully exciting , incredibly idiosyncratic actioner . Before The Hunger Games there was Battle Royale . The bloody spectacle of Japanese schoolchildren being forced into a sadistic game of `` last man standing '' packs an emotional wallop . As usual , Fukasaku directs Battle Royale with force and conviction , even as the tone of the picture veers back and forth from unabashedly ludicrous to deadly serious . Catapults you from the cinema in a state of breathless disbelief . 'Battle Royale ' is another deeply flawed addition to the deeply offensive phenomenon of 'reality TV ' . 	Battle Royale is a controversial and violent parable of adolescence , heightening teenage melodrama with life-or-death stakes .
bread and roses Loach distills transformative drama and subtle interpersonal revelations that rival the most elaborate epic productions . Preaches to the choir and overreaches its grasp , but it could n't be timelier . The strength of this vibrant , stirring film is that it does n't get sidetracked by trying to encompass a love story , and furthermore dares to end on a note that is decidedly bittersweet . It often feels inauthentic , sometimes preachy . Loach 's politics are almost as insultingly simplistic as his melodramatic plotting and one-dimensional characters . Builds to the kind of derisorily bittersweet finale that earmarks productions that are infatuated with their own beliefs . The whole thing has a feel of bad propaganda to it . At times `` Bread and Roses '' looks disingenuous ... Loach and a very good cast make it work . Yet in a period of stylistic ostentation , Loach 's modest transparency of means is salutary . 	Bread and Roses has powerful moments , but it also sometimes descends into preachiness .
hollow man Hollow Man is just that -- a hollow excuse for a movie . The real invisible man here is Verhoeven , whose talent can barely be seen in Hollow Man . At its core Hollow Man is a hollow movie . The characters are shallow , the action is clichd , and the ending is predictable . Hollow Man is hollow is because there 's a void where its imagination should be . It brings nothing to the party except the most simplistic elements . You 'll realize this is nothing more than a sharp-looking slasher flick , bad one-liners and all . There 's so little of the Verhoeven touch in Hollow Man that it could have been directed by almost any studio hack . Is a combo of thrills , juicy one-liners and fine star turns by Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue . Paul Verhoeven has in Hollow Man come up with a movie empty of purpose . [ Verhoeven ] just leaves you hanging . 	Despite awesome special effects , Hollow Man falls short of other films directed by Paul Verhoeven . This flick over time degenerates into a typical horror film .
johnny english This is strictly dull chuckles from dull wits . While Atkinson has physical comedy skills and a deadpan delivery equal to Sellers , his screenwriters take the easy , poo-joke route far too often . If Johnny English does n't rollick with laughs it at least generally frolics with good-natured fun . As funny as a slap in the face with a dead sea urchin . The good jokes are so infrequent Johnny English could be retitled You Only Laugh Twice . If not for the similar Austin Powers movies , maybe a lot of what 's in this film would have played better , and fresher . But as it stands , it looks old hat . Unless you have an incurable case of Anglophilia , save your hard-earned moneypenny for the DVD rental . A good bet for Bean fans , though for others , it 's modest pleasures will play better on video . Por mais que tente , Johnny English no preo para o Inspetor Closeau , Derek Flint ou Austin Powers . Alis , no preo sequer para Mr. Bean . Johnny English is 100 percent Atkinson , which means superficial silliness and wacky pratfalls . If you 're looking for comedic depth or edgy irony , look elsewhere . 	A tame spy spoof that elicits infrequent chuckles .
once Amazing music , great performances . This is really , truly a musical , in the best sense of the word . A simply sung tale that deserves attention . Once captures the intoxicating one-two punch of loving music and falling in love better than any movie since Tender Mercies and The Buddy Holly Story ( 1978 ) . ... a unique , enthralling experience in which song and emotion stand in for dialogue and plot . I guarantee to you that this film will , in a few years , be regarded as a small classic . Discover Once now . The performances are so naturalistic ... the film feels like a documentary about the early origins of a now hot indie emo band . a tender little ultralow budget movie about the intimate connection of making music ... the warm folkiness of the songs and their generally non-narrative-pushing content make it feel more like a long , lovely home movie of a short portion of two people 's liv Once owes its genuine immediacy to the blessed decision to capture its musicians in the flush of actual performance . A wonderfully touching but thoroughly offbeat romance , interlaced with songs . The perfect movie for people who love music . 	A charming , captivating tale of love and music , Once sets the standard for the modern musical . And with Dublin as its backdrop , Once is fun and fresh .
beatles a hard days night A sure-fire boxoffice smash . American-born director Richard Lester serves up a helping of what , on this side of the pond , we came to think of as kicky , mod British filmmaking . Rejected the status quo with an irreverent , quick-cutting documentary style that could fairly be described as mod , rocking and mocking . The result still seems fresh and different decades later . Still feels brand spanking new , and way cool . a priceless piece of history , a commemoration of a time when pop stars were n't jaded and calculating , fans were n't psychotic and music was more important than marketing . A Hard Day 's Night conveys not just a joy in music and The Beatles , but a joy in cinema . One of the most influential films of the past 40 years gets the spit and polish for a reissue -- and it still has n't aged at all . Let 's talk about joy , and about wistfulness , because one so often trails the other , and both are woven into the DNA of A Hard Day 's Night . The film was easy to dance to and had a sound comic rhythm . It still does . 	A Hard Day 's Night , despite its age , is still a delight to watch and has proven itself to be a rock-and-roll movie classic .
roger dodger Genuine movie magic ... it transports you to a place somewhere between eavesdropping voyeur and silent referee . Life 's just full of surprises . Who 'd expect a movie about a rogue and his horny teenage nephew to be so good ? For Kidd , Roger Dodger marks an arresting and auspicious debut . In a career performance that deserves Oscar consideration , Campbell Scott finds that middle ground in-between Aaron Eckhart 's Chad & Vince Vaughn 's Trent so that you loathe things that he says and does , but ca n't help but feel compelled to watch him do hi The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . The film is not just a lot of one-liners but has a buried agenda , as the funny early dialogue slides down into confusion and sadness . Campbell Scott 's amusing and contemptuous performance is the stuff of awards . Blatantly arrogant , unapologetically misogynistic , morally repugnant , and absolutely hypnotic . All these descriptions and more can be applied to the character of Roger Swanson ( Campbell Scott ) A skillfully made but ultimately annoying drama . Campbell Scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of Roger Swanson . 	The movie could have benefited from a more experienced director , but a great cast and script overcome any first time jitters the director may have had .
1185801-the express Exciting football games to watch , a lead character we can root for ... I wish it were about 20 minutes shorter , though . The Express plays for our sympathy -- and wins . ... predictable but inspiring ... It 's tough , admittedly , to sum up someone 's life in just two hours , and even tougher when that person is as genuinely impressive as Ernie Davis . Unfortunately , this movie tries to cram it all in . The Express is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is . We may never see an original sports movie ever again . The last truly original sports movie was Rudy , because it was never a story about winning % u2014 it was a story about heart . The Express shares a lot of Rudy 's DNA . Just because something has been done before does n't mean it ca n't be done again , and well . 'The Express ' is formula-driven entertainment of an uncommonly high order . Director Gary Fleder does an end run around the genre 's cliches , and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau plays with desaturated color and highlights for a rich period feel . A cinematic touchdown . What could have been a blindly reverent biopic , and/or a tediously respectable prestige picture , instead at least tries to deal with the issues it raises , and tries to do so with with some subtlety and grace . 	This inspirational sports biopic set in the the civil rights era is interesting even for non-football fans , and features a great performance by Dennis Quaid as tough-but-fair football coach .
1001781-batman Nicholson is n't only offering a brilliant bit of self-parody here , he 's doing it in service to the character Director Tim Burton effectively echoes the visual style of the original Bob Kane comics while conjuring up a nightmarish world of his own . [ Nicholson ] has never been more commanding . Not only because he does an outstanding job , but also because so much of the movie 's creative energy is devoted to making the Joker one of the most startling movie characters in recent memory . Tim Burton is a genius when it comes to set design and atmosphere , but he ca n't film an action sequence to save his life . Dark , eerie , mean spirited , I love it Good film ... it kind of reeks of the '80s now , but it 's still dark fun . A celebration of form over story Nicholson 's Joker is a villain worthy of a real superhero and Keaton 's Batman gets to perform some cinematic superheroics of the first order . The idea of doing a dark , neurotic , highly stylized and highly claustrophobic superproduction is an audacious and appealing one , but director Tim Burton has only made it halfway there . Highly recommended even for fans who think Batman begins and ends with Nolan 's trilogy . 	An eerie , haunting spectacle , Batman succeeds as dark entertainment , even if Jack Nicholson 's Joker too often overshadows the title character .
muscle shoals 2013 An extraordinary story of singers , songwriters , musicians , producers and , most of all , two recording studios in a small Southern city . Just as `` Sweet Home Alabama '' speaks for itself without revealing its meaning , so does this American story of ferment and feuding and amazing pop music . At once overstuffed with interviews and intellectually underdeveloped , the movie charts the area 's music industry and what is lyrically if elusively called the Muscle Shoals sound . It might have functioned even better as an hour-long TV documentary . But with such great music coming , one hit after after another , it 's always a joy to watch . Camalier 's tuneful if somewhat overlong anecdotal history does the most justice to the Muscle Shoals sound just by listening to it . [ An ] alternately maddening and magnificent documentary . Exceptional music , unexceptional documentary on the swampy sounds of the famous Tennessee backing band . Occasionally baggy , always sincere , this is an essential document of a defining era when 'soul ' really meant something . A sumptuously assembled , exhaustively comprehensive film about music that changed lives . ..Muscle Shoals and its presentation does n't reinvent the wheel ... the treasure trove of stills and found footage makes for a compelling and effortlessly watchable film that even the casual music fan should find themselves totally engrossed in . 	Essential for soul fans and entertaining for novices , Muscle Shoals offers a compelling , warts-and-all glimpse at one of the most fascinating stories in modern American music .
x2 xmen united ... X2 has everything you 'd want in a comic book adaptation ... Bigger , brasher , sexier but much , much more confusing . ... if greatness eludes it , it remains sure-footed and dependable nonetheless , an exemplary roller-coaster ride that expands and enhances the work that came before it . First-rate popcorn cinema and a superfly awesome kick-off to the summer movie season . A truly superior sequel to the original ... Superhero sequel has more action , bigger stakes and a sprawling cast , adding up to big-time popcorn satisfaction . A fitting salute to a comic that has spanned many decades and fans of all ages . Contains maybe the best effects work I have ever seen , with the various spectacular sights not registering with the audience as spectacular because the wizardry that created them does n't call attention to itself . A bigger and better sequel to the 2000 original . Full of dazzling special effects , stunts and fight scenes , but the story is not as strong as the story in the first film . 	Tightly scripted , solidly acted , and impressively ambitious , X2 : X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor -- and a benchmark for comic sequels in general .
cheaper by the dozen 2 This film is funniest when it does n't try so hard . The only ones who are likely to have any investment in all this would be the on-set caterers , who probably bought their own vacation homes after preparing meals for 24 . This cheerless , tiresome sequel is so tastless and flimsy that it proves big families are n't much fun after all . Many families are likely to find Cheaper by the Dozen 2 a holiday treat . All in all , the emphasis in this title is less on the '2 ' and more on the 'Cheaper . ' The movie may play better on video screens in the back of minivans , but I suspect even seat-belted children will remain unimpressed . Okay , everybody , back to your shopping -- there 's nothing to see here . We likely have a sequel because the first Steve Martin family comedy successfully grossed 3 1/2 times its budget by teasing light humor out of family high jinks . That 's all fine , but did it have to be set in summer camp-style ? It aims to be pleasant and good-natured , which it is . There are enough laughs scattered throughout to keep everything moderately amusing , and the cast is likeable . Shankman drops the ball at the finish line , jettisoning the tough-love fun for cheap sentimentality . 	A sequel to a remake , Cheaper 2 wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top , predictable humor .
across the universe The thin narrative wobbles like an alcoholic after last call . Julie Taymor 's flower-powery phantasmagoria is ambitious but ultimately tiresome . This lavish labor of love constantly walks a slender thread between masterpiece and folly , but when all is said and done , it confirms , for me , Taymor 's status as a master . Uma obra frustrante , mas suficientemente curiosa para merecer uma pouco efusiva recomendao . It 's more than a nostalgia trip . The real pleasure lies in Taymor 's ability to make it all seem brand new . I never realized what a lush cast of characters populate Fab Four records . Or how giddy it would be to see Max , Jude , Jo-Jo , Prudence and Sadie come to life . The film 's too long but when it works , as in a slickly choreographed military induction scene with Taymor 's trademark giant puppets and carnival heads , it 's exhilarating . A groundbreaking , rule-bending , expectation-smashing musical . Julie Taymor 's love-it-or-hate-it musical is hugely ambitious but it works brilliantly , thanks to strong performances , a fantastic script , terrifically integrated songs and Taymor 's inspired direction . After Hair , Hairspray and the mass marketing of tie-dye , can the '60s be shrunk to fit any further ? Yes , indeed . 	Psychedelic musical numbers ca n't mask Across the Universe 's clichd love story and uninteresting characters .
mad max beyond thunderdome The punky energy of the earlier films has given way to a self-conscious striving for significance , obscuring Miller 's considerable kinetic talents in favor of a lumpy didacticism . Mel Gibson proves to be a formidable warrior . Disjointed but it still rocks . Not a shade on the originals , but still action to the max ! Definitely the worst movie in the Mad Max series . Weakly plotted , largely a re-hash of the previous movie without even the vaguest hint of tension . Great goofy fun . If `` Mad Max '' embraced a geneticist 's acumen and `` The Road Warrior '' a philosopher 's spirit , `` Thunderdome '' is about cold , hard economics - not just in Bartertown 's transactions but the market expectations that come with the receipt of studio funding . Weakest entry in the series An admirable conclusion to the Mad Max trilogy : softer than its predecessors , but possessing its own unique voice . This middle portion of the picture becomes dangerously preachy , but just before we and Max are bored , director Miller returns Max to his roots , a screaming chase sequence through a desertlike Australian landscape . 	Beyond Thunderdome deepens the Mad Max character without sacrificing the amazing vehicle choreography and stunts that made the originals memorable .
fast and furious People drive fast , perform improbable stunts , things blow up , and the leads glare at each other a lot . If it were a DVD , you 'd Fast & Forward to the chases , but not Forgive & Forget the crushing disappointment . In cinemas , you have to endure exposition and sob-you-were-my-best-friend scenes . It 's clearly time for Fast & Furious Vs . The Transporter ... Parental Content Review The imagination of the almost-identical title matches the imagination of the almost-identical script . Instant immersion is the style of this franchise , plunging audiences into high octane race and chase mode from frame 1 . And it works . Like a souped-up show car , Fast & Furious is all gleaming surfaces and muscular detailing , but there 's absolutely nothing going on under the hood . A tepid , repetitive and digitally augmented hot cars-hot women thriller that might probably wo n't give Vin Diesel and Paul Walker the career boost that The Fast and the Furious did . `` As silly as it is derivative , with quite a bit of unintentional comedy , but the action scenes deliver , and car fetishists will find much to love . '' Feels about as fresh and lively as a piece of burnt rubber . Fast & Furious is all about the speed and crash-boom-bam of the high-octane action , and on that score , it delivers admirably . Does its built-in audience really need anything more ? 	While Fast and Furious features the requisite action and stunts , the filmmakers have failed to provide a competent story or compelling characters .
everlasting moments Discreet , old-fashioned , traditional and altogether admirable , this is Jan Troell at his best . There 's echoes of Remains of the Day in a heartfelt drama that seems blown in from another world . Period pieces like this were once more popular than they are today . It is refreshing to see a solid one like this from time-to-time . Vividly brings to life a woman 's point of view from the past , despite continual victimization frustrating to keep watching with her intermittent respites through photography . Beautifully shot , superbly acted and emotionally engaging drama , though it 's extremely slow in places and feels much longer than its 108 minute running time . Let 's come out and admit it : This is a square , conventional movie where every shot means what it means , with scant ambiguity or artistic license . Surrender to its conservative technique , though , and you 'll be moved as well as entertained . Troell 's lens does n't consistently uncover the beauty and character we 're asked to believe his heroine finds with hers . Rich in both compelling personal experiences and historical detail . Heiskanen is a revelation as the put-upon wife , and the cinematography ( some by Troell ) effortlessly transports us back 100 years . There are some quiet , keenly observed scenes of family life in Everlasting Moments , but they do n't go anywhere , and ironically , the movie diagnoses the reason why . 	Elegant and intimate , Everlasting Moments moves at the deliberate and gentle pace of a classical European period drama .
sling blade There is a lot of rich atmosphere here , and Thornton 's own central performance is riveting . This riveting character-driven drama is a cautionary tale about the ways in which violence desecrates all life . There will never be another film like Sling Blade . And I reckon we 'll have to live with that ... Mmm-mmm . [ Thornton ] does wonders with Yoakam , who could have played a standard villain but always manages to suggest a man trapped within his prejudices . These days Thornton is seen primarily as an actor , but with `` Sling Blade '' he proved a true auteur . If you can adjust to Thornton 's extremely mannered performance , the piece is effectively chilly . Marking Billy Bob Thornton 's debut as a director and solo writer , Sling Blade is a powerful southern gothic parable about good and evil . A real gem . Sling Blade takes you down paths full of primitive , almost biblical implications , but it also finds comic relief in moments of palpable tension . A masterpiece of Southern storytelling . 	You will see what 's coming , but the masterful performances , especially Thornton 's , will leave you riveted .
1190660-over my dead body Over Her Dead Body may be the worst romantic comedy I 've ever seen , although I hesitate to make such a resolute pronouncement about a movie that 's so barely even there . sweet jesus Over Her Dead Body will find its best audience on airplane flights , where viewers will be unable to get up and leave without parachutes . Over Her Dead Body itself is a movie haunted by the annoying , humorless performance of Eva Longoria Parker . [ A ] clumsy supernatural comedy , dogged by truly lifeless plotting and a near-total lack of chemistry . Move over , 'One Missed Call . ' You now face stiff competition for worst movie of the year from 'Over Her Dead Body . ' For a pure shot of cinematic depression , nothing quite tops opening credits that end with `` ... and Jason Biggs . '' Not a life-changing romantic comedy , but it 's funny enough , has charming leads and breezes by in its quick 97 minutes . There was some nasty potential to be mined from Over Her Dead Body 's premise , but the movie simply is n't wicked enough to go anywhere that could really be funny . It 's the Casper of supernatural sex farces . ... neither funny , charming or anything else that will make it a memorable hour and a half of viewing pleasure . 	With few laughs and little romantic chemistry , Over Her Dead Body lacks the ingredients of a successful romantic comedy .
the girl with the dragon tattoo 2009 The slickly plotted mystery ... and the relentless pace of the leads , clues , revelations and cliffhangers make for a brilliantly satisfying whodunit . An intriguing and sometimes disturbing mystery that works reasonably well as a stand-alone film . more of a compressed miniseries vomited onto the big screen , an experience that feels like it has had some critical information cut out of it rather haphazardly . The final result is an adaptation that 's just about as successful as its literary predecessor , with the film occasionally exceeding the book in a few areas ... The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is rife with nightmarishly violent and horrific behavior . It 's intense , graphic , frightening . And , yes , exhilarating . Veers from Visconti 's The Damned to Jonathan Demme 's The Silence of the Lambs without the decadence or the thrills of either . In this case , the victim is Larsson . There 's nothing calming about director Niels Arden Oplev 's style , which is fast and furious and smartly mirrors content . The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo grapples with far more than `` whodunit . '' And it does a handy job of answering that question , too . It 's over-long and almost pathologically detailed , but it 's also an extremely effective and well-made thriller . A finely plotted , stylishly photographed and brilliantly acted whodunit that clocks in at 2 1/2 hours but never seems long . 	Its graphic violence and sprawling length will prove too much for some viewers to take , but Noomi Rapace 's gripping performance makes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo an unforgettable viewing experience .
blue crush Heterosexual males between 13 and 20 , prepare to have your pants go crazy . Is n't terribly original , but it does have the refreshing virtue of showing people smacked around by tsunami-sized waves that , for a change , are mostly not computer generated . Even the girls ' combined charms ca n't stop `` Blue Crush '' from being a dead in the water dud . Never has a shower scene been more superfluous , for Anne Marie is so wet , so often , that her bikini bonds with her tan and her perfect hair to forge a one-woman Water World . The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged . What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . The body-doubling and face-pasting are unfortunately blatant . The acting is generally not bad in this movie ... but the real star is the camerawork . As drama , 'Crush ' is often snicker-worthy ... Do n't be surprised if you find yourself more than willing to forgive the film 's shortcomings , though . An agreeable enough summer diversion . 	The surfing sequences are exhilarating , but the plot is pretty forgettable and trite .
flow for love of water When filmmaker Irena Salina does marshal the facts , Flow is an eye-opening , troubling 90 minutes that makes us think twice about an element we take for granted . An enlightening documentary about the global war over water and the progress being made by activists against multinational corporations and their campaign of privatization . Your tap water might be making you sick . But your bottled water might be making you sicker , while also enabling the environmental rape of the American heartland and unconscionable extortion in the Third World . Salina 's film might have been stronger had it not tried to cover so many water-related issues . But there 's no denying its power . Salina 's film is a very effective primer of an underreported problem . If nothing else , it made me thirsty . Educational polemical documentary . This documentary finds a good balance between terrifying statistics , depressing images , talking heads , and hopeful suggestions . There are more than 116,000 manmade chemicals floating around our allegedly clean H2O supply . One scientist even points to the recent discovery of Prozac in Texas tap water ( which , come to think of it , actually explains a lot about the Lone Star State . ) ... astonishing in the amount of information packed into its lean ninety-three minute running time ... enthralling ( and frightening ! ) to listen to . ( Director ) Salina makes Flow function as a wake-up call to those who take such issues as an international given . 	Flow is an informative , disturbing and enthralling film that highlights a criminally underreported problem .
you will meet a tall dark stranger Allen has said he makes films as they offer him a distraction , and he has created just that : An enjoyable but instantly forgettable distraction . Can films be mellow and bitter at the same time ? Starting with Match Point in 2005 , Woody Allen 's movies have deepened and become more gimlet-eyed about the human condition . Unpleasant people behave selfishly until it stops , rather than ends , in this latest trifle from Woody Allen , who once again manages to persuade A-list talent to help him make a C-list movie . Woody Allen has been directing films for 41 of his just-shy-of-75 years , and if his best work is behind him , there 's something heartening in the recent run of form he 's enjoyed ... None of this breaks new ground , but as is often the case with Allen , the ridiculous absurdities of the characters undermine the habitual pessimistic pose . Like a visit to a beloved senior at a resting home , Woody Allen 's new comedy amounts to a mostly pleasant , sometimes trying afternoon . It 's hard to escape the feeling that Allen has told this story so many times before - and so much better . Elaborately plotted , perfunctorily directed , unevenly acted and short on verbal wit . A lively and funny ensemble comedy with yet another intriguing mix of stars and lesser-known talents playing deeply flawed human beings in search of love and fulfillment . It 's one of his better films of late . Cynical fatalism is Woody Allen 's home turf , and it 's a pretty finely honed shtick at this point . 	It 's sporadically amusing , and typically well-cast , but You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is n't one of Woody Allen 's more inspired late-period efforts .
10010940-happy tears It 's rarely dull and confidently guided by the cast , but it offers little in the way of overall impact , despite creative visual flourishes and a screenplay rooted in the devastating game of personal reflection . It 's cold to the touch . Succeeds only at suggesting the incompatibility of returning-home dramedy and surrealistic flights of fancy . Happy Tears is less of a mess than it looks like , despite its quirk-infested , baggy midsection . Sometimes dysfunctional families are better kept for personal consumption rather than being unleashed on the world at large . Writer and director Mitchell Lichtenstein struggles to find the humor in a host of horrors . Realism falls victim to quirk yet again . I had better write my review as soon as possible because it 's going to fade from memory pronto -- it bearing such little resemblance to humanity as I know it . Other than the guest-starring appearance of Cy Twombly canvases , nothing distinguishes this poor relation of The Savages from all the other emotionally fraudulent Amerindies about familial dysfunction and reconciliation . A vulgar , happy-as-cancer aberration that takes the dysfunctional family idea to a new low . Whimsical , yes . Happy , never . A cringe-inducing , self-consciously kooky indie comedy that 's best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn , who , judging by his recent alleged bank break-in , comes to loose-cannon stuff naturally . 	Replete with quirky indie cliches , Happy Tears wastes some fine performances from Demi Moore , Parker Posey , and Rip Torn on stale formula .
zoolander Some funny moments , but misses a chance to really skewer its subject . Offers up the pleasures that only a thoroughly trivial piece of work can provide . Despite its numerous weaknesses , Zoolander is more enjoyable than many of 2001 's crop of so-called comedies . It 's one of those 'love it ' or 'hate it ' films . And I loved it . Zoolander 's vain stupidity gets as wearisome on film as such behaviour is in real life . The concept of Ben Stiller as a preening IQ-challenged male model is very funny for about 10 minutes and mildly funny for another 10 . More than goofy enough to finish with style . This comedy far exceeds the time span over which watching people acting dumb and making funny faces remains funny . A hit-and-miss Ben Stiller comedy is still in a higher league from the cheap gross-out teen sex comedies that have flooded the multiplexes in recent times . Funny , really ... it 's just ... I do n't know ? ... Missing that inexplicable special something . 	A wacky satire on the fashion industry , Zoolander is one of those deliberately dumb comedies that can deliver genuine laughs .
1104207-panic Henry Bromell does a fine job of directing Panic . It 's a pity he did n't write a better script . An oddly touching movie about fathers and sons and what is passed down between them . Panic is a drama , and an overwrought one at that . Quirky , funny , dark , it hits your funny bone , offends your sense of ethics , occasionally even touches your heartstrings . With all of the insipid films that get released every week , it is a shame that one with this much merit is being ignored . Panic achieves what a plethora of gangster films never approaches : a human-scale portrayal of the psyches of the mobsters , one which demonstrates that not all mercenaries are happy with their sordid work . The results are quietly electrifying . Superlative . A debut as excellent as this deserves more applause . A beautifully crafted , superbly cast little film that 's the very model of what a small independent picture ought to be . 	This quirky little film about a gangster in therapy feels fresh and well-crafted .
beowulf and grendel This gristle-intensive R-rated version of Beowulf travels a predictable revisionist route . ... realistic , [ but ] Polley ... is woefully miscast . Sturla Gunnarsson 's adaptation ... despite some pretty awful special-effects makeup [ is ] a pretty good -- and good-looking -- version of the tale . A muscular , ardently naturalistic retelling of the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon saga . Thus does Beowulf collide with postmodern punk sensibility . Gunnarsson has made a film that would make the real Beowulf and Grendel , if they ever really existed , quite proud . Gunnarsson is only partially up to the challenge posed by his illustrious source material . Imagine the worst Deadwood episode ever , and you 'll get an idea of the general tone of Beowulf & Grendel . Unfortunately , there is ... jarringly contemporary English dialogue ... laced with F-bombs and humor straight out of a Monty Python movie . If you 're game for a strange and beautiful-looking new version of the ( very ) old legend , you can safely give this one a rental . 	Despite the impressive Icelandic scenery , Beowulf And Grendel fails to find its footing in the transition from epic tale to the big screen .
big red one Fuller wrote and directed The Big Red One with a reporter 's respect for detail and a humanist 's respect for the moments that shape lives . The Big Red One is n't even Fuller 's greatest war film . Of those , I 'd rank it fourth -- but that 's not half bad . Fuller 's only A-budget movie is still among the lesser works of this frequently brilliant filmmaker . The splendid reconstructed version of this 1980 film is bigger and better than the original . A big , impressive slab of drama -- maybe not a masterpiece or an epic , but a colorful story that sweeps you up and covers a lot of ground at a fast clip . The reconstruction is a bigger , longer and better movie than the one released in 1980 , but is less than the revelation for which one might have hoped . If you do n't elect to watch The Big Red One through the lens of Sam Fuller 's mystique ... you 'll realize that it has been celebrated in ways that essentially make virtues of its flaws . The film 's overriding mission is to expose both the inherent absurdity and tragedy of war . Personal observation bleeds out of every scene , and somehow it feels like a true story in a way that most war movies ca n't achieve . As the longest and biggest of Fuller 's movies , it magnifies the essence -- good and bad -- of his work . 	The reconstruction of Samuel Fuller 's epic account of his days in North Africa in World War II elevates the film into the pantheon of great war movies .
the-super-mario-bros Bombs explode , cars careen and crash , people leap from dimension to dimension in this blaring , glaring picture . Kids might get a charge out of the mayhem . I got the vapors . This movie , which was directed by music video whiz kids Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel , is sweet and funny and full of bright invention . In short , it 's a blast . It will baffle kids , bore adolescents , and depress adults . Even moviegoers who do n't own Nintendo ( if any such species exists ) will thoroughly enjoy these superheroes . And chances are , this is only the beginning of their film exploits . Unfortunately , the highlights are sporadic . As the ad campaign helpfully pointed out , `` this ai n't no game , it 's a live-action thrill ride . '' Half-true : it is surely not a game , for it is typically held that games are pleasurable . Super Mario Bros. is about as playful and challenging as an unplugged pinball machine . The movie is the trailer , shown over and over and over again . Devotees of the game may derive some pleasure from seeing its obstacles given quasi-flesh and set in motion , but that inert pleasure soon pales in a torrent of none-too-special effects , confusing story line and characters without personalities . There are none of the game 's hidden pleasures , such as booby traps or treasure caches , and the casting is peculiar . 	Despite flashy sets and special effects , Super Mario Bros. is too light on story and substance to be anything more than a novelty .
mutant chronicles There is some excitement to be had . However , it looks like a computer game unwisely made into a movie without the money to do it justice . It 's photogenic people killing mutants before green screens ; what more could you ask ? When the ridiculous and the sublime come within kissing distance like this , you know that , script or no script , Hollywood has found a way to have a wonderful time . Every guy has watched an action film and wondered when we 'd get to the good stuff , but from minute one we 're given `` the good stuff , '' but it 's just not executed well enough , and the film is too kitschy to really be enjoyed . There 's lots of shooting , grenades exploding and things going bang and , even if the film gets bogged down by some needless religious mumbo-jumbo , the whole thing looks great in a grimy , Blade Runner kind of way . It 's a murky film , in terms of both plot ( overcooked ) and visuals ( underlit ) , proudly artificial and yet burdened with a severe pulp deficiency . This is a gruesome film , even by modern standards . It is also utterly devoid of a point , or interesting ideas . There 's no doubting the frenetic energy of Simon Hunter 's steampunk thriller with its deft mixing of CGI and live action . The mutants are artforms of grotesqueness and truly terrifying . Are excitable eight-year-olds - this movie 's intellectual target audience - really going to wait another ten years before they can watch it legally ? ... suffers from a pervadingly low-rent sensibility that proves impossible to overlook . 	Bad acting , poor CGI and clunky script mean this sci-fi thriller is lacking in all departments including the thrills .
gomorrah Visceral but disciplined and beautifully acted . It upends everything you think you know about the mob and mob movies . Where 's Bobby and Marty when you really need them ? Directed by Matteo Garrone , Gomorrah is both a staggering realist thriller and a jeremiad . Matteo Garrone 's provocative film fictionalizes the bleak , horrifying tales of ordinary people swept into the businesses of the Camorra , while illustrating the global reach of the Neapolitan Mafia . If you are looking for heroes , you wo n't find any in this film . The performances are so `` real '' they do n't seem like acting at all . Every story strand informs the others , creating a devastating 360-degree view of how organized crime impacts the country 's everyday people . There 's not much room for optimism here , given the wide-ranging influence of the Camorra , so all we can do is put our faith in the movie itself and the hope that the truth , simply and powerfully told , can make a difference . A tough , cynical , blistering fictionalized study of the Camorra crime organization that controls much of Naples . 	Portraying organised crime with an unflinching realism , this gritty and searing Italian crime masterpiece pulls no punches .
finding nemo Finding Nemo captures a level of wonderment and dark sentiment unmatched even by the previous great works of Pixar . Walt Disney 's throne is very much at risk . Visual imagination and sophisticated wit raise Finding Nemo to a level just below the peaks of Pixar 's Toy Story movies and Monsters , Inc.. Another extraordinary effort from the unbeatable Disney/Pixar team . Finding Nemo is like a great foreign film , its visual and energy having such clarity that subtitles ( or words or stories ) are almost unnecessary . The junior set will most definitely enjoy the jokes and the yarn , but it will be the adults who learn the biggest lessons this time around . There was n't one element I did n't love about this captivating movie . Strikes the perfect balance between the charm and childlike innocence of Disney animation and the cutting-edge humor and hipness of the old Warner Brothers cartoons . A vivid charmer of a movie that makes a welcome addition to the growing gallery of computer-generated animated features . Lives up to the proud , relatively new tradition of Monsters , Inc. , A Bug 's Life and the Toy Story films . The best father-son story in all of Hollywood animation , and maybe animation generally ... exploits the potential of computer animation like no film before it and few films after it . 	Breathtakingly lovely and grounded by the stellar efforts of a well-chosen cast , Finding Nemo adds another beautifully crafted gem to Pixar 's crown .
high-tension-switchblade-romance A French slasher film that strives to be the slasher film to end all slasher films -- and comes close to succeeding . a formally brilliant thriller ... Unfortunately , there 's a third-act revelation that possibly spoils it by tacking on a needless and potentially offensive explanation Deficits are easy to overlook thanks to High Tension 's knowing performances and unnerving combination of ambient sound , fluidly jittery cutting , and sly widescreen setups . [ S ] imply a checklist of familiar gore effects pasted onto an unusually uninvolving story ... miss it , and you miss nothing . Aja 's rip-roaring romp certainly gives horror fans more than their money 's worth . If this film is any indicator , [ Aja and Levasseur ] know their horror . For much of its duration the film is a case of intense fare done with an undeniable effectiveness and ingenuity -- until it lurches into a deplorable surprise twist . I ca n't say much , except that we 've seen it too many times in the past , and each time half the audience feels cheated . Simply terrifying . A lesson in undulated shock . The French slasher High Tension definitely lives up to the promise of its title . 	There is indeed a good amount of tension in this French slasher , but the dubbing is bad and the end twist unbelievable .
my brother the devil 2012 A tender , bracing fraternal drama of London 's gang life , the immigrant experience , and questions no smaller than what `` manhood '' might mean to young men whose traditional cultures are colliding with the worst-and the best-of the secular west . When a both a dog and friend of Rashid 's are killed in a violent gang encounter , El Hosaini frames both of their lifeless bodies on the street in a powerful image that tells of two innocents both bred to fight . `` My Brother the Devil '' is a promising debut that marks El Hosaini as a filmmaker to watch , but one still very much in the developmental stages . Familiar youth crime/coming-of-age framework , novel setting and focus group . With My Brother the Devil , writer-director Sally El Hosaini tells a story both operatic in its implications and quotidian in its sensory , day-to-day details . It 's far superior to what usually comes out of the British slums in the genre of gangland thrillers . Sally El Hosaini shows a deft hand in her story telling and direction belying her inexperience behind the camera . All in all , it 's a robust debut that demands anticipation for Hosaini 's next work . El Hosaini fights the conventions of the brotherly gangster melodrama , but the conventions win . El Hosaini 's skill as a director , and her way with an excellent cast , eventually triumphs . 	A tough , tender tale of familial angst with careful attention to detail , My Brother the Devil is a strong debut from director Sally El Hosaini .
good will hunting Good Will Hunting is another auspicious sign that the best of Young Hollywood is not only bringing back respect for the craft of acting , but for the cogent telling of tales as well . Good Will Hunting may well be the Rocky story of the 90s . [ A ] very good film . This has not been a great year for language in movies , but people are going to be memorizing and reciting some of these lines for years to come . realmente impressionante que dois jovens como Matt Damon e Ben Affleck tenham sido capazes de escrever um roteiro to complexo quanto o de 'Gnio Indomvel ' . Affleck is on my long list for Academy notice this year . Damon ai n't crazy talented like Vincent Gallo , but he 's still more than a pretty face . Uno sale del cine y se da cuenta de por qu la pelcula recibi tanta atencin . As Francis Ford Coppola does with The Rainmaker , Van Sant demonstrates how entertainingly a real pro can direct a strong if not especially groundbreaking story . While the charismatic performances of Damon and Affleck make `` Good Will Hunting '' a difficult entertainment to resist , doing just that is not as hard as the film would like to think . 	It follows a predictable narrative arc , but Good Will Hunting adds enough quirks to the journey -- and is loaded with enough powerful performances -- that it remains an entertaining , emotionally rich drama .
casino-jack ... Hickenlooper never opens up both barrels on Abramoff , leaving all character insight to the movie 's star , Kevin Spacey . Bad idea . Abramoff offers Spacey his most distinct and galvanic character since his highly entertaining take on Lex Luthor in Superman Returns Rather flat , but for Spacey 's performance alone this is a fine examination of the U.S. political system and its inherent problems . Sadly , Casino Jack just does n't measure up to its own yardstick of success . Coming just a few months on the heels of Alex Gibney 's Jack Abramoff documentary , director George Hickenlooper 's feature version shellacs rather than shackles its GOP super lobbyist anti-hero . Hickenlooper was a talented director with a clear , passionate love of movies . It 's a shame his last one had to be this one . Irreverent and satirical with cocksure brilliant Kevin Spacey adroitly handling the constantly shifting , darkly absurdist allegiances . Spacey transforms a villain into a mere scoundrel Spacey , manic as he is , does n't give us insight into Abramoff 's personal contradictions . Spacey has a field day as the hyper-energetic Abramoff , the former producer of the Dolph Lundgren epic `` Red Scorpion '' who observes that `` Washington is Hollywood with ugly people . '' 	Kevin Spacey turns in one of his stronger performances , but Casino Jack is a disappointingly uneven fictionalized account of a fascinating true story .
dr t and the women Dr. T and the Women may put off people who only look for action and a plot-by-numbers storyline , but should be seen by people who crave adventurous filmmaking . The slightly anachronistic absurdity of the conceit -- the travails of a lone gentleman in a world of ladies -- gives the actors room to do some wonderful work . A work in which [ Altman 's ] shrewd observation of the human species has never seemed sharper . Has hardly any plot at all , or believable characters . A shrewd , sideways glance at the incredibly dense ( and darn proud of it ) male of the species . [ Altman ] and Gere , surrounded by various blondes in extremis , mostly keep it entertainingly rambunctious . If the film ultimately feels overindulgent and hardly among [ Altman 's ] best work ... it 's still a jauntily entertaining ride . Lighter and less compelling than Altman 's best efforts , the new one produces a low-level , but still enjoyable , buzz . It 's too bad that the flitting and unconvincing script and direction gets in the way of our enjoying the acting . The movie is a charmer . 	In terms of quality , Dr. T and the Women is one of Altman 's good-but-not-great films . In typical Altman style , it features some great ensemble acting , including a wonderful performance by Richard Gere .
