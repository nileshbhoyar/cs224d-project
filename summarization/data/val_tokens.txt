Someone can become addicted very easily they dont even need to leave their home , and online gambling sites are available at all hours . This also means that they are gambling in private . They may therefore be less reluctant to wager very large sums they can not afford . In the United States in 1999 the National Gambling Impact Study stated `` the high-speed instant gratification of Internet games and the high level of privacy they offer may exacerbate problem and pathological gambling '' , and it is estimated that 75 % of internet gamblers are problem gamblers , compared with 20 % of those who visit casinos . It is very hard to know the identity of an online gambler there have been several cases of people -LRB- including children -RRB- using stolen credit cards to gamble online . Online gambling sites can also get around government regulations that limit the dangers of betting . Because they can be legally sited anywhere in the world , they can pick countries with no rules to protect customers . Skolnik , Sam , , Beacon Press , 2011 , Chapter 5 	Online gambling has increased the incidence of gambling addiction
Gambling makes people concentrate of winning money . Religious leaders of all denominations see gambling as eroding family values because it implies that material goods should be valued above other things like friendships and families . It also sends out the message that success should not necessarily be the result of merit and effort . As a philosophy , gambling culture is incredibly dangerous . Those in society who most need to self-improve , never do . Instead , they tie their hopes and dreams to the lottery . There may be the possibility of winning a big prize , but the overwhelming likelihood is that a gambler will lose money . Instead , governments should be promoting values like thrift , hard work and self-reliance rather than encouraging or even allowing gambling to promote its own negative values . 	Gambling is associated with other forms of addiction and harmful behaviour
Poor people are more likely to gamble , in the hope of getting rich . In 1999 , the National Gambling Impact Commission in the United States found that 80 percent of gambling revenue came from lower-income households . It is immoral for the state or charities to raise money by exploiting peoples stupidity and greed . Taxing gambling is a regressive tax -LRB- this means that the poor pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than the rich -RRB- , and regressive taxation is deeply unfair . Gambling attracts people with little money who are desperate for a windfall . These are the people who can least afford to lose money . 	Gambling affects poor people disproportionately
Gambling can have a devastating effect on families . The most obvious effect is financial as one partner uses all their money on gambling the other needs to support the whole family or the gambler may even gamble away joint savings . Psychologically there is a relationship between gambling and various psychiatric and alcohol disorders . This is also an impact on friends , who do not want to be tied into supporting gambling financially or even just emotionally . Lesieur and Custer estimated that for each problem gambler there were 10-15 other people adversely impacted by the gambling of that person . As with drugs , it is harmful to the individual concerned and their family and friends , and it is better to ban gambling to stop people getting started in the first place . 	Gambling leads to the disintegration of families
Gambling can become a psychologically addictive behavior in some people . According to the Emotional Neuroscience Centre in Massachusetts , Monetary reward in a gambling-like experiment produces brain activation very similar to that observed in a cocaine addict receiving an infusion of cocaine . Because of this addictive nature , many people end up gambling to try to recover money they have already lost . This is known as chasing losses . It results in people staking more and more money , most of which they will lose , and sinking deeper and deeper into debt . People start to gamble without thinking that they will become addicted . Once that happens , it is often too late . A gambling addiction , in addition to the long term effects it has , can result in financial ruin in a few short hours . . 	Gambling is addictive and psychologically harmful
Casinos are often associated with crime , particularly organized crime . When it comes to local crimes a study has found that only larceny -LRB- theft -RRB- liquor violations increased significantly with a small increase in prostitution . But comparing statistics probably does not show the real harm ; drug dealers and prostitutes operate near casinos they know that there are a large number of potential clients in the area . Moreover when a gambler is in debt and wishes to continue gambling due to its addictive nature , he or she often turns to loan sharks as no bank would lend to them . Casinos can therefore be devastating to neighborhoods . It would of course be wrong to assume all gamblers are criminals , although there is an increased possibility that gamblers in debt could turn to criminality through illegal borrowing . These loan sharks themselves usually have links to organized crime , in some cases are actually run by organized crime , and use brutal methods to reclaim their money . By banning gambling the opportunities for loan sharks to offer their services is greatly reduced due to a lesser amount of gamblers in debt , as are the opportunities for prostitutes therefore reducing criminal activity in the areas surrounding casinos . 	Casinos are often used to mask criminal activity
The ethics of private healthcare are not in question here ; indeed , the UK government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources . Critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients remove themselves either by going private , or dying . There is , however , a general understanding that the NHS in the UK is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this . Meanwhile , in the US , private healthcare is the norm . Allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit . Not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery , but there would be more time , space , and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately . 	We already recognize the benefits of individuals who are able to pay for their healthcare doing so .
Legalisation can help to eliminate the corruption currently associated with the organ market . It can also make it easy to regulate , and so safer . Given the mystery of the black market , medical complications are much more likely ; it is necessary to match the donor and recipient together , but this can not be easily done when every step of the organ collection and donation must be hidden for fear of prosecution . Legalisation could also stop the theft or organs and abuse of people like Chinese prisoners who are currently exploited for their organs authorities will become accountable to a publicly recognised and enforced system . 	Legalising the sale of organs will eradicate the black market and ensure safer transplants .
The proposition is not concerned with live people trying to donate their hearts , or other vital organs which they can not live without . No matter how impoverished that person might be , they will not choose certain death for a cash payoff . However , organs like kidneys , and sections of liver , can be and often are donated from a live donor without significant lasting damage . It is patronising to forbid an individual to sell or donate an organ when it is possible for them to live without it . Similarly , the family of a deceased relative , as next of kin , should have the right to receive financial remuneration from their organs . 	People should have rights over their own body and body parts .
Given that the doctors , nurses and surgeons who work around organ transplants are all paid , it is nonsensical that the donor , the most important figure in the organ transplant , should be left out . The United States already allows markets for sperm , blood , human eggs and surrogate wombs . There is no good reason why organs should be excluded when these other human products are not ; there is no moral difference between a kidney and an ovum . Moreover , organ donation is a process , whereas sperm and egg donation are not . Simply put , incentivizing donations through payment will save the lives of many patients in need . The payment from these organs could also hugely improve the quality of life of the donors by lifting them out of debt , or allowing struggling individuals , such as students , to improve their career potential by paying for their university fees . 	The donor should be able to benefit financially , rather than being expected to donate organs with no reward .
It has been suggested that offences such as unconstitutional change of government , drug trafficking , piracy and corruption should be added to the jurisdiction of an African Criminal Court . The ICC is limited to only a small number of crimes . However , an African Criminal Court could not only deal with the existing crimes , but create pan-African solutions in terms of dealing with a number of issues where Africa needs particular solutions . An ACC could deal with piracy off the coast of East Africa , where there is no effective court system , due to Somalia amounting to a failed state . Similarly , unconstitutional change of government prosecutions could amount to a deterrent to coups . IRIN , Analysis : How Close is an African Criminal Court ? , , 13 June 2012 , http : //www.irinnews.org/report/95633/analysis-how-close-is-an-african-criminal-court 	ACC could deal with pan-African problems that the ICC does not address
The balance between peace and justice is a complex issue . The ICC has disregarded peace as a priority in cases , focusing exclusively on justice by indicting individuals , which reduces the diplomatic leeway and drives those indicted towards a bunker mentality . The result then may be the conflict goes on longer and more crimes are committed . Peace and preventing future crimes should come before justice for past crimes . The ICC have focused on prosecuting Omar al Bashir , but it may be a better option to focus on diplomatic alternatives to trials for dealing with the conflict in Darfur . 	ICC doesnt strike right balance between peace and justice for Africa
A regional court would be a good way to balance the competing issues between the legitimate concerns of the African states and the International Criminal Court . It would be able to provide an African solution to African problems , with no accusations of external interference or colonialism . Similarly , it would have some of the advantages of the ICC particularly its independence from individual states , meaning those in high places are more likely to be held to account . With this accountability to an African court there would be an impression of being held to account by peers not outsiders . 	Regional court is best of both worlds
All of the ongoing ICC prosecutions are based on events in Africa , and all those on trial are Africans . The ICC has not brought actions following the invasion of Iraq , or the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Colombia . The lack of action in any matter outside sub-Saharan Africa shows that the international community are happy to allow the ICC to exclusively prosecute Africans . The UN Security Council , which contains no African permanent members , can veto any possible prosecution and refer a case to the ICC . . Replacing the ICC with an African Criminal Court would stop this bias , or perception of bias . This would be done by withdrawing from the Rome statute and the ICC which has been labelled as Western imperialism by people such as Rwandan president Paul Kagame . Rome Statute , Article 16 Rome Statute , Article 13 Du Plessis , footnote 36 -LRB- dead links -RRB- 	ICC is biased against Africans
Needle exchanges allow drug addicts a convenient and safe place to throw away used needles . This directly protects the public from stray needles that are sometimes put in rubbish bins or left lying around . Specifically this protects children who often dont know to avoid needles but it also protects sanitation workers and other staff from being accidentally struck by a needle . Further , the families of those who are drug addicts can also be helped . Partners and loved ones are much more likely to come into contact with the drug addict and fluid exchange is possible . Given that this is the case , the benefits of needle exchanges also extend to these people 1 . Franciscus , Alan . Needle Exchange - A Matter of Public Health So why is the government playing politics with this ticking time bomb ? , April 2003 . 	Needle exchanges protect the public
A needle exchange as mentioned in the introduction allows drug users to trade in dirty needles for new ones . This can prevent disease simply by preventing transfer of fluids from one drug user to another . As such , if one drug addict has HIV and has not yet been diagnosed it becomes less likely that he will transmit the disease to another person . Further , many drug addicts fail to even consider the possibility of infection via dirty needles , the mere presence of a needle exchange in the nearby vicinity causes drug addicts to be more aware of the dangers associated with dirty needles . Further , the liberalising effect that needle exchanges have on public opinion can often cause societal change that allows needles to be bought over the counter . This is especially good in targeting drug users who do not wish to reveal that they have an addiction and allows them use of clean needles . To back this up it has been found by some researchers that , there has been a one-third reduction in HIV prevalence in New Haven , Connecticut , after its NEP had been in operation for only 4 months . Researchers found an 18.6 % average annual decrease in HIV seroprevalence in cities that had introduced an NEP , compared to an 8.1 % annual increase in HIV seroprevalence in cities that had never introduced NEPs . HIV prevalence among NEP attenders in a Canadian city was low , even though high-risk behaviors were common . Injecting drug users in Seattle who had formerly attended an NEP were found to be more likely than non-exchangers to reduce the frequency of injection , to stop injecting altogether , and to remain in drug treatment , while new users of the NEP were five times more likely to enter drug treatment than never-exchangers . `` 1 1 . Debra L. ONeill . `` Needle Exchange Programs : A Review of the Issues '' . Missouri Institute of Mental Health . September 27 , 2004 	Needle exchanges prevent the transmission of disease
Needle exchanges allow drug addicts to see formal parts of the state that they often associate with negatively as institutions that can help them . This allows them to more positively associate with other state mechanisms such as rehabilitation clinics in the future . This is further helped by clinic staff being able to recommend drug addicts to rehabilitation centres should they be looking for help and due to the more anonymous nature of clinic staff , drug addicts might ask for help from them as opposed to a closer person who they fear might judge them . In addition , social services for addicts can be centred on needle exchanges . Rehabilitation clinics as well as simpler facilities such as washrooms can be centred there as well as clinics for disease diagnosis . Further , in the clinics themselves , posters and information pertaining to drug awareness can be circulated in order to help addicts .1 , 2 1 . Debra L.

Gamblers may win money from time to time , but in the long run , the House always wins . Why should governments allow an activity that helps their citizens lose the money they have worked so hard to earn ? The harm is not just the loss of money and possible bankruptcy ; it causes depression , insomnia , and other stress related disorders -LSB- 4 -RSB- . The internet has made gambling so much easier to do and encouraged lots of new people to place bets so dramatically multiplying the harm . 	Gambling is bad for you .
Direct aid undermines local markets within developing states . Many economists believe that economic growth needs to occur at a local or micro level , with private industry spurring growth and providing employment opportunities that act to elevate consumer demand . Chile is often given as an example of a country which has grown in this way . Government aid frequently results in the growth of large , state-owned corporations which undercut the creation of local markets , preventing the development of private enterprise . This can be compared with the deskilling effect that long term food aid has caused within developing nations . Lacking the will or economic resources to expand land cultivation schemes , formally and culturally acquired farming have dropped out of use in a range of developing states . Dependence on centrally distributed aid is slowing reducing the number of skilled , practiced agricultural labourers able to work to grow food . Similarly , state-owned resource extraction and processing firms can influence an economys real exchange rate , making cross border trade in the commodities produced by farmers and local craftsmen uncompetitive a situation known as the Dutch disease . This is a significant hazard in continents with a high proportion of interdependent sovereign states , such as Africa . State owned industry frequently undercuts local , privately owned industry in both the domestic and export markets of developing nations . Further , these processes raise the spectre of corruption in state institutions and state owned businesses , with large revenues tempting individuals to engage in graft , nepotism and patrimony . The risks inherent in state supervised industry and micro-economic stimulus can be avoided by supplying aid funding to microbanking and microcredit institutions . Businesses of this type specialise in creating a large supply of low cost credit that small firms , farmers and households can borrow in order to fund the purchases and investments that will bring them closer to prosperity .

16 year olds are mature enough to make important decisions such as voting . If the government agrees that 16 year olds can have sex , join the army , and apply for a passport , then surely they are mature and responsible enough to decide who runs their country and makes important decisions that affect them . Their bodies are fully adult , they have been educated for at least 10 years , and most of them have some experience of work as well as school . By this time , it is likely a teenager will have developed Advanced reasoning skills ... the ability to think about multiple options and possibilities . It includes a more logical thought process and the ability to think about things hypothetically . This means they are able to form political views and they should be allowed to put these across at election time . Indeed by 16 children are as tolerant as adults and their political skill -LRB- the perceived ability to participate effectively in civil life by writing to political leaders and by speaking publically at meetings -RRB- is as high at 16 as for those in their late twenties . There is no magic difference between 16 and 18 - indeed , many 16 year olds are more sensible than some 20 year olds . 	16 year olds are mature enough to vote
There is a notable difference between how young people and the elderly are treated . Giving the vote to teenagers would force politicians to take them seriously . Policies on education -LRB- e.g . student loans -RRB- would have to take their views and interests into account for the first time . 16 year olds today are well-educated and media-savvy , so they can express informed opinions . But at the moment young peoples views are easily ignored by those in power because they dont have the vote . The vote for 16-18 year olds would help redress the growing age imbalance which is occurring as a result of aging . In the rich world by 2050 one in three will be a pensioner and one in ten over 80 . These voters will clearly be looking after their benefits at the expense of the young . 	Voting at 16 would help rebalance voting ages
There is a problem of apathy in many western countries , with low turnouts at elections . Young people are taught citizenship or civics at school with the aim of building however they dont get a chance to put this knowledge into practice for several years . Is it surprising that they lose interest in public affairs during this time ? Because national elections are usually only held every four years or so , many people have to wait until they are 20 or 21 , years after that civic education , before their first chance to cast an important vote . It is noticeable that political interest is much higher among those in education than those who are not . In Austria it was found that 68 % of 16 to 18 year olds in education were interested in politics against only 45 % of those who are working . By demonstrating trust and promoting inclusion , young people would feel more confident in their views , become less disillusioned and eventually teach their children the same values . Introducing a lower voting age can only have long term benefits for the expansion of democracy .

In a war-torn society MONUSCO helps with disarmament , demobilization and reintegration -LRB- DDR -RRB- . DDR is of crucial importance for the future stability of the DRC . They have used the latest technology and decades of UN experience with visible success . Thousands of ex-combatants have already been returned to their homes and reintegrated into the lives of their communities . By March 2011 almost 210,000 ex-combatants had been through the demobilisation process out of an estimated total of 300-330 ,000 .

The elections process is moving ahead well . While elections can not be said to be an unqualified success there have been two general elections , in 2006 and 2011 . Local media is vibrant and competitive . And there were a large number of candidates . In the 2011 elections the observers from the African Union and other organisations welcomed the successful holding of elections and the spirit of cooperation and solidarity . Moreover the whole election process is moving ahead ; the countrys first ever local elections are planned for 2014 . This will provide the people with much more say over their daily lives .

With the Ceasefire Agreement of Lusaka in July 1999 the so-called `` Africa 's World War '' ended .

A balanced gender ratio allows that every man has a woman to marry theoretically of course as not every individual wants to marry and not every individual is heterosexual . The majority of men and women do want to get married . In China , men face such competition to find a wife that they spend several years living in horrific conditions in order to save up enough money to have a property with which to present a prospective wife . Without a property these men will never find a wife . These men clearly have a desperate desire to find a woman . There are 3 problems with this situation . 1 -RRB- The dissatisfaction men experience when they strongly desire to marry but can not is an unhappy thing and surely lowers their quality of life . By 2020 there will be 24 million Chinese men of marrying age with no wives . It has even been suggested that this dissatisfaction is contributing to a rising crime rate in China . 2 -RRB- Because men are so desperate they will take any woman they can get . The dating agency industry has grown massively in China and parents even gather in town squares to advertise their daughters , rejecting or accepting candidates based only on whether or not they have a property and a good job . This means couples are less likely to be compatible and , though divorce is not as popular in China as in the west , couples are more likely to be unhappily married . Divorce has increased a huge amount as the gender imbalance has increased . 3 -RRB- Those men who do not find wives often look to prostitution or possibly women trafficked into the country for companionship and sex . 42000 women were rescued from kidnappers in China between 2001 and 2003 . There are clear harms to the women involved in such activities and to womens rights as a whole when this occurs . There are harms to society as a whole when this occurs in the name of HIV and other STDs . 4 -RRB- The prevalence of prostitution and trafficking as well as the focus on male wealth when it comes to dating and marriage placed women in a position where they are seen only as a financial asset or commodity to be sold , bought or traded . Placing women in this position will have psychological harms such as lowered self-esteem and more tangible harms when society treats them with less respect and womens rights cease to develop in a positive direction . 	The policy will help alleviate the social problems arising from the imbalance
Poor nations find it difficult to sustain efficient and well-disciplined armies . Good training and regular pay is vital for this , something that is unlikely to be forthcoming with a cash strapped government . Yet such a disciplined army is one of the vital prerequisites for security and a stable country . Discipline is needed to prevent the army turning on those it is supposed to protect , and it is need to secure the country from other groups both internal and external . Poverty therefore enables rebellions , civil wars , and local warlords by helping ensure that the poor states involved dont have the resources to control their territories . It should come as no surprise that of 12 major ongoing conflicts five are on the African Continent -LRB- and another one if the conflict in DR Congo were to be included despite it potentially being at an end -RRB- . -LRB- 1 -RRB- In addition to this , a poorly funded army is a threat in itself , as the lack of training of the soldiers may translate into unprofessional behaviour , such as engaging in crimes and rapes , or even worse launching a full scale coup in the hope that they will grip the power . -LRB- 1 -RRB- list of ongoing armed conflicts , , accessed 21 November 2011 , 	Poor states have trouble providing security
Unfortunately , there is a vicious circle , caused by poverty that many poor countries find themselves in . A poor country also means a poor , ill-funded government . Such an institution is either unhelpful in preventing poverty or a road block to poverty alleviation . A poor population is also unfortunately more likely to lead to an autocratic government . This phenomenon can be shown by looking at decolonisation . Poor countries when decolonised , even if they initially had democratic aspirations quickly fell to dictatorship . There are very few exceptions such as India that have managed to continually maintain a democratic government while poor . Wealthy countries when decolonised are much more likely to become democracies and once poor autocracies become rich the pressure for democratisation usually becomes unstoppable so countries like South Korea democratised as they became wealthy . There might be considered to be a wealth threshold about which states will become democracies . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The reason why poverty is likely to lead to dictatorship is simple ; a lack of an educated , effective civil service . When the government is very small it cant effectively control the whole country or ensure accountability . The result , especially when civil servants are poorly paid is corruption and an opening for the army , or any populist who appears to offer a solution to take power . Once dictatorship occurs it can usually be maintained by force until the population is educated and connected enough to engage in a democratic revolution . There is then a free pass for those in power to exploit their position through corruption . Many dictators , including in Africa have become very rich indeed . Mohammed Suharto , Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko -LRB- the former dictators of Indonesia , the Philippines , and DR Congo -RRB- extorted up to $ 50bn -LRB- 28bn -RRB- from their impoverished people -LRB- 2 -RRB- . A vicious cycle is created whereby the government needs money , so corruption and extortion are rampant . Those in power are more concerned with their own wealth than the people which makes the government poorer and less efficient so providing more incentive to resort to illicit means of funding . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Cois , Carles ; and Stokes , Susan C. , Endogenous Democratization , , 3 June 2003 , -LRB- 2 -RRB- Denny , Charlotte , Suharto , Marcos and Mobutu head corruption table with $ 50bn scams , , 26 March 2004 	Poverty creates a vicious circle
All that is being proposed here is giving the President the same power enjoyed by 44 out of 50 state governors . One strength of a federal system is the way `` Our States are our laboratories of democracy and we can look to them for the best practices and innovative ideas . '' They point the way to solutions that others , including the federal government , can adopt . And at state level the line-item veto power is very valuable in restraining spending and preventing waste ; Congressman John Baldacci argues that `` Unlike the Federal Government , the States by and large do not run deficits and they keep their books in order and spend only what they have each year . They pass realistic budgets and they stick to them . It is certain that this authority is a crucial part of keeping spending in check . While it may not be used with great regularity in many States , the fact that it is available encourages the legislatures and the Governor to reach agreement on spending issues and not to crowd the spending with extraneous matters . '' Because it is used irregularly there has been no general erosion of legislative authority within these states . 	It is a power that state governors already have
The line item veto could prevent omnibus appropriations bills as with a possible veto there would be little advantage to congress in bundling such spending together . In recent decades , huge omnibus appropriations bills have become the norm , these are bills that `` package many , often unrelated , proposals in a single , very long piece of legislation '' . Presidents have had to accept these bills in their entirety or see the federal government shut down for lack of spending authority . Presidents from the 1790s to 1974 had an impoundment power not to spend money which Congress had appropriated . This power was lost in 1974 , with increasingly bloated budgets and pork barrel spending the result . Congressman Phil English has said that `` For far too long , Presidents have had to adopt an '' all or nothing '' approach when considering action on bills containing appropriations . This presents a predicament for them when good policies are overloaded by unnecessary spending proposals . The case for this amendment was clearly demonstrated by the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations Act last October . Many provisions in this bill were last minute '' pork '' projects that should not have been included . '' accessed 5/5/11 	Prevent last minute omnibus appropriations bills
The present system of earmarking in Congress is wide open to abuse . The party leaderships in each house can use the offer of pork , or the threat to withhold it to enforce party discipline . Logrolling occurs whereby an earmark is obtained in return for support on an unrelated piece of legislation . All this leads to legislators who put party above country and vote for bad legislation in pursuit of their own vested interest . They basically are federal dollars that members of Congress dole out to favor seekers often campaign donors . In the process , lawmakers advocate for the companies , helping them bypass the normal system of evaluation and competition . Forcing pork out in the open by making Congress vote to defend it after a Presidential line-item veto is the best way to remedy matters . Overall the President is more accountable to the people as a whole than individual representatives , and with their national mandate , more able to stand up to powerful interest groups . , accessed 5/5/11 	The line item veto prevents an abuse by congress
The particular subjects areas often chosen by theists to find offensive make for an interesting list ; To name but a few . There are remarkably few areas of human progress and development intellectual or societal that have not caused offence in some religious community somewhere . The best known is of course the Catholic Churchs forcing Galileo to recant his research in the 17 century . There is no need to seek out obscure fanatics for this purpose , mainstream religious figures seem to genuinely believe that the equality of women is still a difficult issue . To take just one example , in 2012 the supposedly moderate and progressive Anglican Communion is still unsure as to whether the ability to be a senior manager should be determined on the basis of somebodys gender . With the exception of a handful that are in thrall to religious dominance , every nation state , company , charity , university and scholarly discipline has resolved this question and found itself better as a result . Most religions havent even started the process . Now thats offensive . 	Stifling progress and the right of others
Morsis inability to tackle the main issues which faced Egypt was another issue which caused the large-scale protests leading to his removal . One of the major reasons for Egypts Lotus Revolution was the lack of economic reform . Rising living costs , unemployment and wage levels were causes of grievance for the majority of Egyptians . The Egyptian population hoped that , once the corruption of the Mubarak regime was replaced by a democratic system , their economic condition would improve . This was not to be the case . The Morsi government planned to reduce its fuel subsidies to entitle the country to a $ 4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund , raising the living costs of the average citizens . In conjunction with the subsidy cuts , the government failed to tackle unemployment . At the time of Morsis ouster from government there were 3.6 million unemployed , an increase of one million since 2010 . Analysts linked the lack of jobs to the security of the state claiming that unemployment would lead to greater numbers of rioters and furthering instability . In a poll assessing the Egyptians attitude toward their government and their future , 61 % felt they were worse off than five years ago . This dissatisfaction then led to dissent . 	Morsis economic and social policies had been ineffective and unpopular
Another major concern of the anti-Morsi protestors on whose behalf the Egyptian army intervened was the Islamist nature of Morsi . While many supported the Islamic nature of the Muslim brotherhood , there were equally many liberals and Coptic Christians who were afraid of Egypt transforming in to an Islamic state . Mubarak had managed to secure popularity within these groups by exploiting this fear that , should his regime be overthrown , extreme Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood would take control and deprive them of their rights . The Morsi governments constitution was thus perceived as a threat to minority and secular rights , and thus a security issue . Even if this was not the case , Morsi should have done more to calm the populations fear rather than allowing discord to materialise . 	Morsi was going to implement Islamic policies on a secular country
The official line of argument for the Egyptian armys intervention was that Morsis administration was failing to grasp control of a worsening situation . The response to Morsis judicial immunity had been largely negative , with tens of thousands taking to the streets to protest . Soon after , pro-Morsi protestors began their own protests . Muslim Brotherhood supporters were called to defend the palace and the resulting clashes left ten dead . On the 1 July 2013 millions of protestors gathered in Tahrir Square , as well as in Alexandria , Port Said and Suez and the Egyptian army stated it would intervene if the government did not meet the demands of the people by restructuring the government to appease protestors . The protestors did not disperse , and there were several ministers who resigned from government . With no clear policy change in sight , Morsi had evidently failed to take control of the situation . General el-Sisi , leader of the coup , claimed that they could not stay silent and blind to the call of the Egyptian masses . The intervention was necessary as Egypt had become ungovernable . 	Failed to gain control of the Egyptian crisis
Elected representatives should be working for the people and take only their interests into account . Politicians who also run their own companies , hold directorships or manage extensive share portfolios could stand to gain or lose substantially from individual pieces of legislation . This is likely to affect their vote and so distort the political process . At worst this can become outright corruption , as groups with vested interests pay elected representatives to lobby on their behalf , or reward them with lucrative directorships if they vote in certain ways . As an example , in the sphere of business and control the Institute of Internal Auditors -LRB- IIA -RRB- have commented that a conflict of interest occurs in a situation in which anindividual , who is in a position of trust , has a competing professional or personal interest . Such competing interests can make it difficult to fulfil his or her duties impartially . A conflict of interest exists even if nounethicalor improper act results . A conflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety that can undermine confidence in the individual , or their activity , and the profession . In the legal profession Judges are obliged to excuse themselves from hearing a case if they hold shares or have a political interest in one of the parties as there is a need not only to provide for an unbiased trial in which justice is done but also a need for public confidence in the system and justice to be seen to be done . In the case of politicians there is a similar need - a need for them to act in an unbiased manner doing justice to the needs and wants of their constituents and also a need for public confidence in their ability to what most benefits their community as opposed to what most benefits them . 	Elected representatives have a conflict of interest if they hold additional posts
The uncertainty of employment in politics is well known to every aspiring and incumbent politician , and prompts a delicate balancing act between ones dedication to the general public and posturing for future employment . Current salaries force politicians to look to the private sector to find additional work in order to offset what are often steps down , at least in monetary value , from their previous positions taken in order to become an elected representative . In Britain , Members of Parliament earn 65,000 , a decent wage but nowhere near the salary many MPs would expect in the private sector . Therefore , rather than forcing elected representatives to pander to interest groups to provide future security , it would be better to seek to counter the incentives offered by the private sector and for the state to offer to guarantee retired and defeated politicians a pension , or funding to update their professional skills to increase their employability . The financial security such packages would offer would also allow elected representatives to spend more time in government and with the public they purport to represent . 	The Government should provide incentives to incumbent politicians to prevent the need for additional posts
The public has a right to demand that its elected representatives work full time on its behalf . Legislators or ministers with outside interests will inevitably have less time and energy to devote to affairs of state and may become pre-occupied with outside interests or indeed devote time better spent advocating on behalf of their constituents seeking to gain support for personal endeavours connected to their other sources of income . Elected representatives are invested , through their election , with a democratic mandate and an attendant duty to represent and lobby for the interests of the individuals who elected them . By dividing their time and their attention , between posts and failing to prioritise their representative duties they risk compromising their ability to adequately participate in the process of Government . Henry Clay once remarked that `` Government is a trust , and the officers of the government are trustees . And both ... are created for the benefit of the people . '' While the context in which Clay made his remarks has very much altered the fundamental message it delivers remains as relevant today as it was at the time of its utterance - a trustee may hold no position which jeopardises his duty to his beneficiaries , neither can public representatives be allowed to engage in activities which jeopardize their duties to the people . 	The public has the right to demand that elected representatives work full time on its behalf
The status quo discourages interdependence : the absence of property rights under the status quo encourages unmarried couples to act as individuals , protecting their own financial interests , rather than supporting each other . In UK law , their relationship with one another is not recognised as having any legal standing , and they have no special status in the eyes of the English legal system Individuals are usually more able to pursue their own ambitions when they have the support of another . For example , financial support and security makes it easier to take risks which may be economically beneficial , such as setting up a new business , or undergoing further education to improve employment prospects . 	The status quo discourages interdependence
Property rights for unmarried couples undermine marriage as an institution , harming society . The societal shift away from marriage is harmful . Marriages tend to be more stable than cohabitation because of the greater level of commitment involved : the mutual support of a marriage is beneficial for individuals and can create a more secure environment for raising children . Because of the higher exit costs -LRB- divorce is difficult and time-consuming -RRB- , married couples are more likely to resolve their problems than cohabiting couples who can walk away more easily . Giving legal rights to cohabiting couples endorses more diverse relationships , suggesting that marriage is less important . This is harmful as it is likely in the long term to further reduce the number of marriages , leading to fewer stable relationships . 	Property rights for cohabiting couples will undermine the institution of marriage
Fairness requires that cohabiting couples share their property on separation : when couples have lived together for a long period -LRB- such as five years or more -RRB- they will have gained benefits at each others expense but also suffered disadvantages for the others benefit . If one partner gives up a career to raise children or support the other in their career , they are seriously disadvantaged upon separation . Where the other partner has gained as a result of this sacrifice , they should compensate the former , so that the two parties can move towards independence in equal positions . Parties may choose not to marry , but this should not have to cause such financial harm to one partner . 	The courts have a duty to develop services that will meet the needs of society
People are apathetic about politics because they only get to vote once every few years . Even then it is not directly for policies but for competing political parties who promise to implement them -LRB- but often reverse position when in office -RRB- . They feel that politicians do not listen to them between elections , and disengagement with the political process grows and grows . More frequent referendums would stimulate interest in politics because people would actually get a say in decisions . For example , evidence from the US shows that states with frequent use of ballot initiatives tend to have higher voter participation in elections . 	Reduces public apathy about , and disengagement from , politics .
The trend in developed countries tends to be towards greater centralisation , and concentration of power in the hands of a small number of representatives . This , in turn , leads to the creation of a separate political class who will in some cases be more concerned with their own influence and enrichment than that of the voters , and makes it possible for wealthy individuals or companies to lobby politicians for laws favourable to their interests . Increased use of referendums would potentially reduce the influence of lobby groups and corporate donors on the political system . 	Improves standards in political governance .
Particularly on contentious or controversial issues . Laws passed by public approval in this way will be less open to challenge , with all sides having to accept the will of the electorate . This is especially true of minority or coalition governments who may face accusations that they do not have a mandate for certain policies , or situations where minority groups are exercising their right to self-determination . 	Referendums can lend greater validity to political outcomes
Many countries have two or three party systems in which there is no spread of opinion between these parties . The parties reflect sterile mainstream consensus and do not offer voters what they really want . Consequently , large sectors of the public find their views unrepresented . Referendums will remedy this and increase engagement with the political system , because people will know that their views simply can not be ignored . For example , a majority in the UK favour the return of the death penalty , but no party among the main three offers this . Whatever your views on this issues , it seems unfair that there is simply no way for voters views to be represented . 	Ensures that all views are represented in political debate .
In the past , it was impractical to organise frequent referendums due to the difficulty and expense of holding them . But with the advent of the internet and mass media , it is now easier than ever to consult the public on issues of concern to them . For example , Switzerland regularly holds referendums on all sorts of issues in an efficient manner which commands widespread public support . 	Modern technology makes consultation easier than ever .
Governments exist to serve the will of the people , not the other way round ; politicians take their instructions from their constituents , or should do . But in the modern state this relationship is often inverted . By obliging our democratic institutions to take genuine account of public opinion , and returning real political power back to those to whom it rightly belongs the people we can put the relationship between the individual and the state back on a healthier footing . In principle , people should have the right to decide for themselves on matters of importance to their lives . 	Redresses imbalance between state and individual .
Just because somebody chooses to be an actor , singer or an entertainer of any kind does not mean that they lose their right to a private life . In the context of the UK -LRB- the Scope of the Leveson Enquiry -RRB- its worth mentioning that this right is guaranteed under both the Human Rights Act of 1998 , which in turn is predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights . The people who are having their private lives splayed over the tabloids and gossip magazines are not politicians or judges taking bribes , they are not police officers beating up suspects , they are not teachers offering grades in exchange for sexual favours or any other area of sensible journalistic investigation . They are people who happen to work in the entertainment industries and their lives are being interrupted for the sake of prurience and curiosity that has nothing to do with a meaningful news agenda . If , as some of those mentioned in the introduction suggest , the worst that happens as a result of such a register is that celebrity magazines vanish , then the proposition is quite relaxed about that .

Every person indicted by the ICC so far has been an African , for events which occurred in Africa , all bar one case , the Libya situation -LRB- in which no trials have started and seem a long way off -RRB- , are in sub-Saharan Africa . The ICC has not brought actions against anyone involved in conflict in Colombia , or for the conflict in Sri Lanka or for human rights abuses around the world . The ICC is simply selectively prosecuting . 	The ICC has an anti-African bias
Instead of the ICC structure , the African Union has proposed an African Criminal Court . An ACC could not only bring justice home to Africa , by creating a court which will not appear to African nations as being imposed by outsiders , but also be able to have additional remits to address other issues in Africa that the ICC does not have powers to deal with , such as coups , corruption and drug trafficking . An African Criminal Court may also have a chance of being seen as more legitimate than the ICC , which had only 39 % support in Kenya in July 2013 .

Boys and girls distract each other from their education , especially in adolescence as their sexual and emotional sides develop . Too much time can be spent attempting to impress or even sexually harassing each other -LRB- particularly boys toward girls -RRB- . Academic competition between the sexes is unhealthy and only adds to unhappiness and anxiety among weaker students . As Tricia Kelleher , a school principal , argues , rather than girls defining themselves by their interests , they define themselves by what the boys think of them or what other girls think boys think of them . Furthermore , John Silber , President of Boston University , declared in 2002 that his university would prioritize male applications in order to even up the student composition and ensure the male population did not become ungentlemanly towards women due to their numerical inferiority . A single-sex environment is therefore a space where -LRB- children -RRB- can learn without feeling pressurized by the other sex . 	Boys and girls are an unwelcome distraction to each other
Teachers frequently favour their own gender when teaching co-educational classes ; for example , male teachers can undermine the progress and confidence of girl students by refusing to choose them to answer questions etc . . A recent study by the American Association of University Women found that gender bias is a major problem at all levels of schooling , asserting girls are plagued by sexual harassment and neglected by sexist teachers , who pay more attention to boys . As a result , girls tend to fall behind their male counterparts . 	Teachers favour their own gender in co-educational schools
Co-educational schools attempt to establish uniformity in the teaching of two groups , boys and girls , who typically learn and develop at different speeds and using different methods . They do not develop in the same way or at the same time ; boys favour visual processing and do not have the hand-motor control that girls readily achieve in early grades . It is widely accepted that boys develop more slowly than girls . . thats true at every level of analysis . Furthermore , they develop physically at different speeds , girls often developing earlier which can lead to bullying from the opposite sex for those who either over-develop or under-develop . Therefore , it should come as no surprise that , at least in the United States , elementary school boys are 50 % more likely to repeat a grade than girls and they drop out of high school a third more often . If they were taught separately and the curriculum and teaching was tailored to their needs , drop-out rates would not be so high nor as vastly disproportionate . 	Boys and girls develop at different times and speeds , therefore they should be taught separately
Women in particular benefit from a single-sex education ; research shows that they participate more in class , develop much higher self-esteem , score higher in aptitude tests , are more likely to choose male disciplines such as science in college , and are more successful in their careers . In the USA Whos Who , graduates of womens colleges outnumber all other women ; there are only approximately 50 womens colleges left in the States today . Elizabeth Tidball , who conducted the Whos Who research , also later concluded that womens colleges produced more than their fair share who went on to medical school or received doctorates in the natural or life sciences , typically male fields . 	Women are better off in single-sex institutions
Bluntly , the payment of ransom is exactly what the criminal in question wants . It aids them financially , and brings a swift conclusion to a risky situation . Both of these factors greatly decrease the chances of their detection and capture . Given the threat posed by such serious criminals it is more than reasonable for the state to prohibit an action such as ransom payment , which so greatly rewards criminal behaviour . The potential rewards of kidnapping has also led to the practice spreading across borders . In 1999 , 92 % of all kidnappings took place in just ten countries ; by 2007 , the practice had spread to six more countries . So long as ransoms continue to be paid , the practice will not stop spreading . 	Ransom payments reward criminal behaviour .
The payment of ransom has very real and serious practical harms for society . In addition to aiding the non-detection of such criminals , the payment greatly increases their ability to conduct such acts in future . As many cases of ransom take place within networks of organised crime - the funding from these payments can greatly increase the capability for further acts of ransom -LRB- and other crimes -RRB- in the future . In states like Mexico , where up to forty per cent of the national population feel unsafe due to profligate kidnapping , more has to be done to discourage or capture kidnappers This provides solid ground for criminalising acts which propagate such activity . Society is not merely harmed by fears for one 's own safety , financial fears still exist over the extent of the Somalian piracy epidemic . Despite more than $ 80 million being paid to pirates in 2008 alone , ransom prices continue to rise . With ships and cargoes continually willing to pay , the costs may eventually be passed onto consumers . 2 . 3 . Harper , 2009 	Ransom payments harm society by encouraging kidnappings .
Ransom payments are means to ends , and when utilized by criminal organizations , those ends are similarly criminal . Stop paying ransoms , and the funds for criminal activities will dry up . When the African Union banned the practice in 2009 , Algeria argued one of its primary motivations was preventing the likes of Al Qaeda ` using ransoms it receives in neighbouring countries to finance attacks on security forces inside Algeria ' . In the Philippines , police officials have called for criminalization due to fears that ransom payments have allowed Abu Sayyef , a militia linked with Al Qaeda , to survive and finance deadly bomb attacks . 	Ransom payments are used to finance other crimes .
In situations where police forces are inadequate , it is even worse to incentivise ransom further by giving kidnappers virtual certainty of payment -LRB- as is the status quo in many areas -RRB- . It is this combination which underlies the epidemic nature of ransom in some parts of the world . At least if payments were criminalised , potential kidnappers would know that a pay-off would be less likely , and thus some would decide it was not worth the risk . This would allow police forces to concentrate resources on the remaining cases where kidnappers are more determined . 	Criminalization would act as a deterrent against further kidnappings .
Ransom payments should be criminalized and payees arrested if they are found to have paid a ransom . The police should retain a monopoly on all negotiations , both to ensure kidnappings are not materially rewarded and to improve their own efforts to stop the practice . While not all kidnappings may end peacefully , if the police are aware of them all , it may only take a few leads in a few cases to break a kidnapping ring and reduce the threat to society as a whole . Furthermore , the involvement of police will drag out hostage negotiations , making the overall industry less profitable to kidnappers for whom time is money . The African Union in 2009 adopted such a resolution , ` condemning the payment of ransoms to terrorist groups to secure the freedom of hostages ' . 	Ransom payments should be criminalised , and payees forced to contact police .
Many of the problems associated with cannabis use arise from the fact that it is illegal . Cannabis is the worlds most widely used illegal drug 23 % of Canadians admit to having smoked it and up to 7 million people in the UK are estimated to do so . In 2009 , the UN estimated that the market for illegal drugs was worth $ 320 billion . This market is run by criminals and is often blighted by violence . It has cost thousands of innocent lives , particularly in supplier countries such as Mexico and Afghanistan . In the US , Milton Friedman estimated that 10,000 people die every year as a result of drug dealers fighting over territory . Many of the victims are innocent people , caught in crossfire . By legalizing cannabis , the size of this market for illegal drugs would be significantly reduced and so , effectively , would the number of crimes and unnecessary deaths that come with it . Another way of seeing the problems of prohibition is to look at the failed attempt at alcohol prohibition in the 1920s . People continued to consume alcohol , only it became 150 per cent stronger , was as easy to obtain for minors as for adults , and was sold by murderous gangsters like Al Capone Given all of the problems associated with prohibiting cannabis , it seems nonsensical to spend billions fighting a drugs war when instead governments could reduce crime and make money by selling cannabis in a regulated manner . They could spend some of the profit on treating people who did experience any harmful effects . 1 . United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , 2010 , 2 . Hari , 2009 , 3 . 	If cannabis was legalized , it could be regulated
Although cannabis can have some harmful effects , it is not nearly as harmful as tobacco or alcohol . Research by the British Medical Association shows that nicotine is more addictive . In England and Wales , cannabis was said to have helped cause 17 deaths , compared to 6627 for alcohol and 86,500 for tobacco . A study , published by The Lancet , that scores drugs out of 100 for the harm they cause the user and others , gave alcohol 72 , tobacco 27 and cannabis 20 . Given that tobacco and alcohol are more likely to harm the user and other people , it seems ludicrous that they should be legal and cannabis should not be . The legalization of cannabis would remove an anomaly from the law . 	Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs , yet remain legal .
It is important that we have the liberty to do what we want to our own bodies . People are allowed to eat or drink to their detriment . In many countries it is legal to take one 's life . Why then , should people not be allowed to harm themselves through cannabis use ? -LRB- Assuming that cannabis use is harmful . In most cases , this is highly debatable . -RRB- Smoking cannabis may have effects on others , such as through the effects of passive smoking . However , regulation has been brought in to minimize the effects on others for alcohol and cigarettes , such as bans on smoking in public places , and the same thing could be done for cannabis . 	People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies
Cannabis use can alter one 's perception of reality or consciousness . The alteration need not be thought of as spiritual or religious to be respected for what it is ; a fresh look on a reality that we are programmed as humans to perceive only in a particular manner . Cannabis can help humans perceive that complex reality from simply a different perspective , which can benefit our appreciation for that reality and our unique and limited perceptions of it . With this more intelligent approach to cannabis consumption , it is easy to argue that mental , perceptual , and societal benefits exist . 	Cannabis opens the mind in a positive and beneficial manner
The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- finds that with current capture technologies , carbon dioxide emissions reaching the atmosphere from fossil fuels can be reduced by about 80 90 % -LRB- 2005 -RRB- . This leads the International Energy Agency to conclude that CCS is a key technology to stem carbon dioxide emissions that can be responsible for up to 18 % of emission savings in a safe scenario for climate change -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . This is because CCS can be fitted to existing power plants rather than requiring completely new plants to be built . 	CCS is an efficient way to curb emissions of greenhouse gases
The International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- 2011 forecasts that global energy demand will increase by one-third from 2010 to 2035 , and 90 % of the increased demand will come from non-OECD countries like China and India -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . With the state of technology as it is , alternative technologies like solar power are insufficient to meet this demand . This means we will continue to use fossil fuels and will continue to increase carbon dioxide emissions the IEA predicts a 20 % increase of carbon dioxide emissions , causing a long-term increase in global average temperature , with catastrophic effects . If we cant escape using fossil fuels , we should at least limit their emissions as much as possible , and CCS is a very effective means to that end . 	CCS helps mitigate the effect of our continuing use of fossil fuels
Currently , there are many projects around the world demonstrating the feasibility of CCS . One well-known example is the Sleipner-project in Norway . This site has been in operation since 1996 . Another example is the Weyburn-Midale project in Canada , which has stored over 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since October 2000 . -LRB- 2011 -RRB- We can easily implement CCS because the technology is well-known and tested . The technology of injecting carbon dioxide into gas - and oil fields has been used already when drilling for gas and oil : oil companies use carbon dioxide injections to push out oil and gas . -LRB- , 2005 -RRB- . 	CCS can be implemented now
It is often unclear whether extremist political organisations are likely to become violent or to engage in provocative acts of hate speech . Although the state does not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisations from meeting or protesting , it does have a right to control the manner and circumstances in which such meetings take place . Doing so ensures that citizens who do not want to be involved in , or whose activities and freedoms might be materially affected by the articulation of extremist views can go about their business without hindrance . Part of the states role is to balance these sets of incommensurate rights . All western liberal democracies use their police forces to enforce this balance . It is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the political views of a police officer or a state solicitor responsible for overseeing the circumstances in which a rally or gathering will take place and the balancing role of the state . A police officer with links to an extremist party may , conceivably , be made responsible for policing the conduct of friends and political allies . If such a situation was to arise , the capability of the officer to make appropriately impartial , value neutral decisions about the types of activity that would be permitted at such a demonstration might be compromised . Even if the officer expressly adopts a neutral stance , personal ideological bias may still lead him to perceive a demonstration by his friends and allies as inherently less threatening or in need of oversight than a protest mounted by another organisation . Not only will this undermine the polices ability to supervise and regulate individuals democratic rights , it will also have an impact on the perspective that ordinary people adopt in relation to the state . Marginalised citizens may be less willing to approach police officers for help if they are aware that their biass go unchallenged . One of the causes of the marginalisation of minority groups is bias in service provision among civilian service providers suspicion of similar bias amongst the police may create a culture of distrust among many minority groups . 	Conflicts of interest and public sector employees
Government employees are , ultimately , duty bound to uphold the policies and principles implemented by the executive branch . The executive is limited in its range of action it is necessary to delegate certain of its duties to bodies such as the police , the military and the education services . As representatives of the government , employees whom obstruct or attempt to subvert the laws that it implements are effectively obstructing the liberal autonomy of the fellow citizens . The executive is elected and empowered on the basis that it will bring about certain changes to law and society that have been mandated by the electorate . The executive is also given the authority to act to fulfil broader , more aspiration goals that echo the desires and objectives of society as a whole . At every stage in its life cycle , a state remains democratically accountable . Politicians undertake to set personal ambition aside and to act as representatives of the popular will their own values and political beliefs take second place to the beliefs articulated by the electorate . A government would be completely ineffective , and would rapidly loose the confidence of the electorate if it enacted policies according to the personal preference of its members . Similarly , the groups and individuals to whom the governments power is delegated can also undermine its mandate if they also refuse to impartially implemented democratically sanctioned laws and policies . A government employee who decides to pursue his own political agenda in the course of doing his job fails in his duty to impartially implement the laws and policies constructed by the executive . Thus , members of racist or extremist political movements should not be employed by the government , as there is a risk that they will prioritise their own beliefs and political objectives over those of the electorate . Not only do governments have a duty to ensure that they pursue egalitarian and equitable employment policies , they also have a much more important duty to ensure that the machinery of the state is effective and efficient . Without appropriate vetting , this duty can not be fulfilled . Notable failures under the status quo include the discovery that a number of workers employed by the UK tax authorities to oversee support payments to poor minority families had been deliberately reducing the amounts of money families received . Indeed , extremists are more likely to ignore their duty to act impartially because of the heterodox nature of their beliefs . The term extremism implies a willingness to depart from moderate and open discourse , and to set aside social convention in the pursuit of political beliefs . Many political parties such as the BNP portray themselves as victims of repression by a liberal elite , while at the same time remaining cognitively blind to the fact that liberal forms of political discourse are the basis of their organisations existence . Under these circumstances , individuals whose view of the world has been systemically distorted by their beliefs are more likely to use positions of power to correct the imbalances that they perceive in society . Political parties also function as peer networks . Membership of a party gives individuals a certain sense of belonging and allows them to influence and define the identity of other members . Members of extremist parties who do not want to use their position to promote extreme views are likely to come under pressure from other party members to do so . Even if a member of an extremist party vows that he will not abuse his role as a teacher or a civil servant , others who share his beliefs will try to convince him to do so . 	The public sector is an extension of the elected executive
Turkey has been heading towards being a one party , even a one person , state . Erdoan is intending to change the constitution is an attempt to institutionalise this . His new presidency would have the power to issue decrees with force of law , dissolve parliament and call elections , and to command the military . The attempt to change to a presidential system is clearly a move to enable Erdoan to avoid the limit of three terms in much the same way as Vladimir Putin did by switching jobs . A presidential system is not bad in principle but it should not be simply used as a vehicle for a particular politician . Moreover any change of such a magnitude in a democratic country should be done only with popular consent something that this change does not have . In a February 2013 poll 65.8 % of Turks favoured keeping the parliamentary system and only 21.2 % were in favour of a change to a presidential system .

The rule of law , limits on the power of the state , and the provision of personal rights are key to any country being considered to be a liberal democracy but these are being undermined in Turkey . This is most noticeable when it comes to freedom of the press . Turkeys press freedoms have been in decline . It is a dismal 154 on the press freedom index and most notable is that it is the country with the most imprisoned journalists with at least 76 imprisoned , mostly without having been convicted and as a result of their work . The lack of freedom of the press and how cowed the press is has been shown in the recent rioting ; CNN covered the protests live , at the same time its Turkish language subsidiary CNN Turk was broadcasting a cooking show . 21013 World Press Freedom Index : Dashed Hopes After Spring , , 2013 , Greenslade , Roy , Turkish press freedom crisis , , 23 October 2012 , Cook , Steven A. , and Koplow , Michael , How Democratic Is Turkey ? , Foreign Policy , 3 June 2013 , 	Turkey does not have the freedoms associated with democracy
If a tyrant comes to power by illegitimate , undemocratic means and directly suppresses , harms , and kills the citizens of a state , that tyrant loses all legitimacy to the continued occupation of office . If it is impossible to depose the leader by more subtle means of opposition and democratic voting , the only route to freedom may be assassination . In such cases , assassination is certainly justifiable , provided that as Dietrich Bonhoeffer points out , there exists a ` group capable of quickly occupying , or remaining in , the key organs of the totalitarian dictatorship ' . The assassination of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi would undoubtedly lead to the installation of a democratic regime with the full backing of the Libyan people , yet his fierce , paternal grip on the army prevents this from occurring . 1 . Perry , D. L. -LRB- 1995 -RRB- . Repugnant Philosophy . Retrieved June 2 , 2011 , from Journal of Conflict Studies : 	Assassination is a means to regime change and the lifting of a blanket of suppression on a population .
Armed invasions are costly events , in terms of the lives lost , the emotional trauma and the ever-widening hole created in the economy . Assassination provides a means to accomplish the goals of a military campaign without having to put boots on the ground , removing the predominant obstacle to democratic reform or energy security . As Angelo Codevilla argues , ` the military art consists of striking those people and things most likely to stop the enemy from continuing the war ' As the Gulf War demonstrated , often the quarrel is not with a state but its leader and it would be ` futile and immoral to demolish a country in the hope that this will persuade the tyrant to give way ' . Furthermore , Ari Fleischer , a spokesman in the Bush administration when asked about the cost of a possible war with Iraq , remarked ` the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than the cost of war the cost of one bullet , if the Iraqi people take it on themselves , is substantially less than that This admission belies the Bush administrations belief that Husseins assassination would allow them to accomplish their objectives without a prolonged ground campaign . 1 . Perry ,1995 2 . Addicott , 2002 . pg 759 	Assassination can be cheaper than an armed invasion , both in lives and money .
The utilitarian justification for assassination lies in the many deaths and much suffering potentially prevented if just one man or woman is killed . The greater good demands a single evil act is done , especially if it would avert the immediate and certain danger of much worse evil . Oppressive , tyrannical dictators who sustain their own power through fear have no legitimacy . Who now would n't wish that Hitler had been killed in 1933 ? Or Pol Pot in 1970 ? The casualties directly inflicted as a result of their misguided policies could have been avoided . As a last resort therefore , assassination stands as a ` permissible means to a just end ' , handing the reins of the state back to its oppressed population . 1 . Perry , D. L. -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .

Debts that are incurred by regimes for purposes other than the benefit of the country are called `` odious debts '' . Such debts are held by many legal theorists , like Alexander Sack and Patricia Adams , to be ethically unenforceable . Expecting a government to pay back the debts accrued by a tyrant or dictator to finance their own self-enrichment is an unjust practice , as the people of the state , and the present regime , have not benefited fully , or at all , from the debts incurred in their name . Rather , as such tyrannical regimes made little distinction between the personal holdings of the dictator and those of the state , the debts accrued by him should be considered personal , not public debt . An example of the debt burden created by dictators is the case of Haiti , where Jean-Claude Duvalier , dictator from 1971 to 1986 , pursued a policy of mass corruption and self-enrichment , taking on foreign loans to finance his own lavish lifestyle and the repression of the Haitian people . 40 % of Haiti 's current debt is the result of Duvalier 's corruption . To expect the democratic government of Haiti to pay for these excesses is entirely unjust and only compounds to the harms already inflicted by the dictatorship . Clearly , states that lend money to such tyrants can not justly attempt to extract payment from successor regimes , considering that the loans they made often helped keep repressive dictators in power . 	The debts incurred by many developing countries are the results of loans made to dictators and tyrants and not that of current regimes
The debts of many developing countries were forced upon them at the time of , and often as a condition of , independence . Colonial powers thus placed extensive amounts of their own debt on the shoulders of their former territories . For example , the Netherlands forced Indonesia in 1949 to accept as a condition of independence the entirety of the colonial government 's debt , itself the result of mercantilist exploitation by the mother country and the high cost of fighting the Indonesian rebels who struggled for independence for four years . France imposed a similarly high cost on Haiti in exchange for independence . Forcing a new nation to effectively pay for the exploitation they suffered as well as for the soldiers and weapons that killed their own countrymen is manifestly unjust . Left with little wherewithal to pay , it is only right to cancel the debts owed by these countries . 	Debt can be the result of the legacy of colonialism and not the fault of the independent government
Cancelling debt and the interest payments these debts entail is the easiest way of helping the poorest countries develop . The cancellation of the debts would only apply to government to government debt and debts to the big international institutions such as the World Bank so there are relatively few actors who need to agree to the cancellation . As the cancellation would be done between governments it would be easy to target which countries get debt cancellation , this would mean the poorest and most in need but could potentially mean excluding countries where the windfall will simply mean propping up a regime that is brutalizing its own people . The IMF and World Bank could look at countries on a case by case basis to see which countries are most deserving and where the cancellation would have greatest benefits . The actual cancellation of the debts would then be relatively simple , the governments would simply accept that they are never going to be repaid and take the debt off their books . 	Cancellation is the easiest option to help the poorest develop
Because of the often insurmountable debt burdens laid on them , developing countries are forced to spend much of their economic resources on servicing the interest on their debt , rarely making much progress on reducing the principal , and thus locking themselves into a perpetual cycle of poverty . For example , due to their debt burdens most African states pay four times as much on interest payments as they do on healthcare . Structural Readjustment Programs instituted by the IMF in some countries in order to reschedule debt payments have actually led to backsliding in quality of education , health , and welfare . Furthermore , developing countries often devote resources to production of `` cash crops '' for sale in the developed world rather than on food crops . The perverse incentives created by the need to pay off crushing debts has led many people in agriculturally fertile countries to starve . By cancelling debt , these countries have a chance to invest in their own future and devote resources to long-term development , rather than persistent debt repayment . 	Debt cancellation saves lives , reducing both poverty and hunger in developing countries
Broadcasting trials would be likely to turn the court in to entertainment . The Simpson trial showed how harmful a televised high profile trial can be degenerating into a freak show . The ICC trials are among the most high profile in the world so are likely to be susceptible to this . Much of the interest in the SCSL Charles Taylor trial came along when Naomi Campbell gave evidence so giving the trial celebrity interest that had little to do with the legalities involved . Jurisdictions where cameras are not permitted in courts still can and do have accurate , informative and timely reports of cases , however high profile , without filming them . Courtroom sketches , written transcripts and other tools allow reportage without the use of original footage in a tawdry manner .

Televising the trial can create extra incentives for defendants to attempt to disrupt the process . During his trial , Saddam Hussein regularly made outbursts and went on political rants based on Iraqi law , he was able to examine witnesses after his lawyer . This was not new Slobodan Milosevic tried various antics in front of the -LRB- televised -RRB- ICTY , and Ratko Mladic used those tactics post-Hussein . Milosevics approval ratings grew , and he even won a seat in the Serbian parliament while on trial . A televised trial creates more of a risk of a political hijacking of the trial something that has been shown to be a successful tactic by Milosevic . This both potentially damages the successor government by giving those on trial a platform and the court itself . Biles , Peter , Mladics courtroom antics , , 4 July 2011 , 	Unruly defendants can play up to the cameras
Televising criminal trials may cause a number of problems with witnesses . It may make individuals less likely to give evidence , make them more likely to play to the television audience , or make the already intimidating process of giving evidence in court more so . Also , television broadcasts make it more likely that the identities of anonymized witnesses would leak out something that has already happened at the ICC in the Ruto-Sang case . The ICC already has problems with witnesses , including allegations of bribing and intimidating prosecution witnesses in the Ruto case , which has led to Walter Barasa , a Kenyan Journalist , being subject to an arrest warrant .

Corruption in African governance is a common feature of African governance , with resources being a major source of exploitation by the political class . Natural resources are often controlled by the government . As resources fund the governments actions rather than tax , there is a decrease in accountability to the citizenry which enables the government to abuse its ownership of this land to make profit . To benefit from resource wealth , money from the exploitation of mineral wealth and other sources needs to be reinvested in to the countrys economy and human capital . Investing in infrastructure and education can encourage long term growth . However a large amount of funds are pocketed by politicians and bureaucrats instead , hindering growth . Africa Progress Panel -LRB- APP -RRB- conducted a survey on five mining deals between 2010 and 2012 in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- . They found that the DRC was selling off state-owned mining companies at low prices . The new offshore owner would then resell the companies for much more , with much of the profit finding its way to DRC government officials . The profits were twice as high as the combined budget for education and health , demonstrating that corruption caused by resource exploitation detracts from any long term growth . Straziuso , J .

The majority of investment in Africa by Trans National Companies -LRB- TNCs -RRB- goes towards resource extraction . Many companies use transfer pricing , tax avoidance and anonymous company ownership to increase profits at the expense of resource abundant nations . Production sharing agreements , where companies and states share in the profit of a venture , can often benefit the former over the latter . In 2012 Ugandan activists sued the government for one such deal where the country was to likely to receive only half the profits rather than three quarters . Kofi Annan , former United Nations Security General , has claimed that Africas outflow of funds by TNCs in the extractive industries is twice as high as inflows to the continent . Businesses such as Barclays have been criticised for their promotion of tax havens in Africa . These allow TNCs to avoid government taxation for projects such as resource extraction , a symptom of the attitude of foreign companies to investment in Africa . The unfavourable inflow/outflow balance prevents reinvestment in Africas infrastructure , education and health services . African Development Bank African Development Report 2007 pg .110 Stewart , H.

There is a strong connection between the presence of natural resources and conflict within Africa . Natural resources , especially those with a high commodity price such as diamonds , are a useful means of funding rebellions and governments . The 1991 civil war in Sierra Leone became infamous for the blood diamonds which came from mines with forced slavery . These diamonds were used to fund the Revolutionary United Front -LRB- RUF -RRB- for eleven years , extending the blood-shed . Continued conflict in the Congo is also attributed to the control of mineral wealth and exemplifies how resources have negatively impacted Africa . Pandergast , 2008 , Kharlamov , I.

Illegal immigrants are openly flaunting the law , and permitting them to enter the country in this way demeans the hard-working individuals who immigrated legally . If people become angrier about illegal immigrants because more of them are coming in without a fence , this may also lead to the negative outcome of poorer treatment of Latinos who live and work legally in the United States . If there were no or very few illegal immigrants , there would be much less tension in communities since everyone would know that all the inhabitants had come there legally . 	It is important to maintain and enforce the principle of the rule of law , and a fence does that .
Mexican violence between drug cartels frequently spills over and threatens the lives and peace-of-mind of Americans as well . The Council on Foreign Relations has said that Mexico 's levels of violence and lawlessness over the past few years exceed even those in Iraq or Afghanistan . That has forced a costly increased police presence in border areas , and even that often proves insufficient to quell the killings . But even if the violent common criminals were somehow suppressed because of stepped up actions by the Mexican government , an easily penetrated border presents a national security threat . The FBI has warned that it is likely that Al Qaeda operatives and other terrorist groups will use the porous Mexican border as a means of infiltrating the country and launching deadly plots against American citizens in future . To prevent the carrying out of attacks , America needs secure borders . McGreal , Chris . `` The battle of the US-Mexico frontier . '' 	A fence would dramatically increase American safety .
The Secure Fence Act of 2006 authorized the construction of at least two layers of reinforced fencing in high-crossing and high-risk sections along the border . This includes around the border town of Tecate , Calif. , and a huge expanse stretching from Calexico , Calif. , to Douglas , Ariz. , which is virtually the entire length of Arizona 's border with Mexico . Another section would stretch over most of the southern border of New Mexico . An additional section will wind through Texas , from Del Rio to Eagle Pass , and from Laredo to Brownsville . This would not only be a fence but will include technology to secure `` operational control '' of the border by using unmanned aerial vehicles , ground-based sensors , radar , satellites and cameras . Weisman , Jonathan . `` With Senate Vote , Congress Passes Border Fence Bill . '' 	The fence is a practical way to stop immigration and large parts of it have been built .
Ironically , even Mexico recognizes this when it attempts to increase border enforcement along its own southern border with Guatemala . If those policies are lawfully set by the people and legislature , then regardless of how efficacious a particular tool is , it is justified . It is clear that the fence is wildly popular well over half of the United States supports it , and many individuals are so adamant about increasing border security that they are willing to make donations for these purposes . The social contract of the United States means that the government is democratically elected and therefore accountable to its people . If they want to focus on securing the borders instead of providing more extensive welfare programs or reforming education or anything else they could be spending money on , that is their prerogative . 	A state has a fundamental right to set immigration policies and take the necessary steps to make them work .
A fence would help defend the economy of the United States during difficult times by protecting American jobs . It is a popular misconception that immigrants only do the types of jobs that native-born Americans will not take . Many professions encompassing construction , grounds-maintenance , housekeeping , and janitorial services actually have the majority of jobs performed by native-born Americans . Furthermore , illegal immigrants constitute a tremendous drain on various public benefits . These include medical treatment -LRB- because no one who is seriously injured or sick can be turned away from the emergency room as a result of a law called EMTALA -RRB- , municipal services like fire and police protection , food stamps , and education in public schools . Every dollar that gets spent on illegal immigrants is a dollar that could have been spent on law-abiding American citizens , who need all the help they can get during these difficult times . Camarota , Steven and Jensenius , Karen . `` Jobs Americans Wo n't Do ? '' Jordan , Miriam . `` Illegal Immigration Enters the Health-Care Debate . '' 	A fence would help defend the economy of the United States .
There are two often-discussed ways to change the rules : require the runner to slide , just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases ; or disallow catchers to block runners paths . Each results in an imbalance between the catcher and runner . A commentator describes this dynamic very well : If Major League Baseball was to employ a rule stating that runners must avoid contact with the catchersimilar to the slide or avoid rule employed in amateur baseballit would give the advantage to the catcher . The catcher would have the benefit of dictating the course of action that a baserunner must take , and wouldperhaps more importantlyhave peace of mind knowing that there is no chance of an ensuing collision . If Major League Baseball was to make a rule stating that the catcher can not block the plate , the advantage would certainly go to the baserunner , who would enjoy the luxury of a straight path to the most sacred ground on a baseball diamond . Allowing collisions is the fairest , most even match between the catcher and runner . Ricky Doyle , Buster Poseys Injury Unfortunate , But Home-Plate Collisions Still Have Place in Baseball , , May 29 , 2011 , . 	Without collisions , either the catcher or the runner would have an enormous and unfair advantage .
Some hits lead to injury , but the vast majority do not . One commentator challenged proponents of a rule change to name as many as five MLB catchers in the last 30 years who have had their careers ended or shortened as a result of a home plate collision . Personally , I cant think of one . In posing somethough not a substantialrisk , home plate collisions are very much like other aspects of the sport . Every time a pitcher throws a pitch , the batter could get struck and hurt . Every time two outfielders converge on a fly ball , theres a risk of injury . Baseball , as with many other sports , inherently involves the risk of injury . It makes little sense to focus on this play , which doesnt often result in significant injury . Moreover , catchers are trained to position their bodies in ways that minimize the injury risk from crashes . If catchers do as theyre trained , theyre very unlikely to get hurt . Joe Janish , Buster Posey Aftermath : What Should Be Done ? , , May 30 , 2011 , -LRB- internal quotation marks omitted -RRB- . See , for example , Relays , Cutoffs , and Plays at Home , , . 	Collisions are not as dangerous as theyre feared to be .
Baseball is a form of entertainment , and few plays are as entertaining as bang-bang plays -LRB- a close call on whether the runner is thrown out -RRB- at the plate . As a sport thats often criticized for being too slow and boringbaseball has no clock , the saying goes its important that it hold onto perhaps the most dramatic , vivid play it has to offer . One columnist described it this way : When -LSB- collisions -RSB- do occur , theyre exciting . We watch to see how well the catcher blocks the plate , how hard the runner slides , and whether the catcher can hold the ball . As dangerous as that play may be , its exciting to watch . Other sportslike American football , ice hockey , and rugbyfeature plenty of violent hits . Baseball has so few of them that when they do happen , they are doubly entertaining . It is just not necessary for baseball to prohibit a small dose of something that is extremely common in other sports . William Deresiewicz , Metaphors We Play By , , June 6 , 2011 , . Nick Cafardo , Lets keep rule change off our plate , please , , May 29 , 2011 , . 	Collisions are exciting and fun to watch .
First , collisions are part of the tradition of baseball . They have been part of the game for a very long time . Fans , players , and managers all expect home plate hits to occur from time to time . Some things are part of the game . Theres not a whole lot you can do , said Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek , who has been on the receiving end of numerous crashes in his career . Variteks manager at the time , Terry Francona , agreed : Nobody wants to see anybody get hurt , but you got to play the game . And former catcher Brad Ausmus , who had also been hit multiple times in his career , echoed the sentiment : -LSB- I -RSB- t 's part of the game . When you put on the shin guards and chest protector , you know that if theres a play at the plate and youre blocking the plate , you could take a hit at any moment . As the Associated Press put it , many people believe home plate collisions are as much a part of baseball tradition as peanuts and Cracker Jacks and the seventh-inning stretch . Second , home plate hits are an essential element of playing the game hard . Without them , baseball would be much less deserving of its nickname hardball . One commentator notes , -LSB- An injury is -RSB- extremely unfortunate , but it 's the result of a hard-nosed play that is as old as the game itself . To take away the potential for a high-intensity , physical play in an otherwise non-physical sport would be a mistake . In that vein , collisions are also part of the dynamic between the offense and defense that , once removed , will make the game much poorer : A baserunner wants to get there at all costs , whereas a catcher wants to protect it at all costs . The mutual discomfort that 's evoked in both the catcher and the baserunner as a play at the plate develops is one of the intriguing peculiarities that makes the game of baseball so great .

No government is monolithic . In every regime there will be moderate forces willing to use diplomacy and negotiations and extremist elements that do not . By demanding that preconditions be fulfilled before a meeting , all power is given to the extremists . Israel-Palestine is an example of this . By often demanding that violence cease before negotiations can take place , the US and Israel give a veto over negotiations to Hamas , who are the perpetrators of violence . They get to decide if and when negotiations take place . Instead , the president of the United States should always try to engage and strengthen moderates within these regimes . 	Preconditions are like granting a veto to the extremists .
If , in order to meet with his counterpart , a rogue leader needs to compromise on his and his countrys position even before he gets to the table , this would be a signal of weakness to his opponents at home and those vying for his job . For example , in North Korea , which is going through a dynastic transition , the new leader Kim Jong Un is yet to become established and consolidate his status as dictator . Any concession to the sates designated mortal enemy , the US , might jeopardise the succession . Similarly , in Iran where Ahmadinejad has fallen from the graces of the supreme religious leader , the Ayatollah , agreeing to preconditions in order to get a meeting with Obama would signal to the Iranian Presidents rivals that it may be a good moment to attempt to force a change of guard . Profile : Kim Jong un . 31 December 2011 . 	Agreeing to preconditions can damage a leaders position at home .
Preconditions delay engagement and negotiations . Sometimes it can take years before the parties even start talking to each other . In that time , Iran will continue to enrich uranium and North Korea will continue to expand its nuclear arsenal . If the US waits for preconditions to be agreed on and met , by the time president Obama gets to talk and negotiate directly with the leaders of these states , he will have a much bigger crisis to deal with . It may have even gotten to the point where diplomacy can no longer be used effectively . Borger , James . Irans acceleration of its nuclear programme angers the west . 19 July 2011 . 	The more the US waits , the stronger its opponents become .
No country is likely to agree to conditions that will significantly reduce its bargaining power once it gets to the table . It would be diplomatically foolish to agree to preconditions that would essentially be the subject of the negotiations and the reason why the negotiations were needed in the fist place . If North Korea agreed to freeze development of its nuclear arsenal , or if Iran agreed to stop its nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leaders took place , the position from which they started negotiating would be significantly weaker than the USs . Klein , Rick . Obamas Evolving Take on Meeting with Iran . 	Preconditions can damage a countrys negotiating position .
From its early days , the Obama administration has strived to change the tide of US foreign policy , by moving away from Americas unilateralism and dismissiveness of other nations . Its treatment of its foes is a product of that same attitude . The general policy not to meet or negotiate without preconditions is akin to dangling a spot at the table like some sort of prize that foreign leaders need to work for . In international law , all states are sovereign and equal with no one having a right to interfere with others internal affairs . This means that all leaders should treat each other with respect and deference . Harnden , Toby . Barack Obama : arrogant US has been dismissive to allies . 3 April 2009 .

If a creature suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration . All animals are sentient beings that experience joy , happiness , fear and pain , in the same way that human beings do . As Bentham previously noted , it does not matter that they can not express this suffering in the same way as humans can -LRB- by speaking about it -RRB- or reason about their suffering in the same way - the important thing is that they can suffer in the first place . We can have no right whatsoever to make them suffer for our ` enjoyment ' . If any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemnation , bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment . We must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence . It is too small a step from the intentional infliction of pain on an animal to the torture and killing of human beings . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Bullfights perpetuate the idea that injuring and killing an animal for amusement is acceptable , and that is not an idea which any state with any concern for animals , or for its human citizens , should wish to be prevalent . Part of the ` attraction ' of bullfighting for crowds is witnessing death . Advocates of the practice make this into an argument for the practice . But , a desire to see death in front of one 's own eye 's amounts to bloodlust . Why should humans be accommodated in such a morbid pursuit ? Eric Gallego , an animal rights protester , said in 2010 : Bullfighting is a bloody entertainment . We must stop this cruelty because we dont want to be a barbaric society in Europe . -LRB- 6 -RRB- This argument applies just as much to any other country in the world : why would we want to encourage people to enjoy pain and suffering , as we have laws which make causing pain and suffering illegal -LRB- both for humans and animals -RRB- in almost every other context ? Bullfighting is therefore immoral , and encourages cruel and immoral behaviour in other areas , and so it should be banned . 	Harming animals for entertainment is immoral
Bullfighting constitutes animal torture because it is exactly the suffering of the animal from which the entertainment of the crowd is drawn , and the level of suffering inflicted is on the level of that caused by torture . Jeremy Bentham argued that `` Cock-fights and bull-fights , the chase of the hare and the fox , fishing , and other amusements of the same kind , necessarily suppose a want of reflection or a want of humanity ; since these sports inflict upon sensitive beings the most lively sufferings , and the most lingering and painful death that can be imagined . '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- The want of humanity even in modern bullfighting is shown by the sadistic cruelties inflicted on the bulls : According to anti-bullfight veterinarian Jos Zaldvar , in the great majority of cases , the matador missed the vital spot that would cause the bull to die quickly . `` These provoke internal bleeding . It is a slow , agonising death as the high acidity of their blood proves . '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- At the end of the fight , the bull may not be yet dead while his body parts are cut-off to be kept as trophies . Spanish bull breeders receive EU agricultural subsidies , meaning that , in the EU , taxpayers ' money from all countries -LRB- not just those with legal bullfighting -RRB- goes to support this terrible industry . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Also , in order to reduce the risk to the matador , sometimes the bulls horns are shaved . This can inflict some pain on the bull and can also make it more sensitive to other forms of pain during the fight . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Moreover , bulls are not the only creatures to suffer in bullrings . The tormented bull does not understand that it is the man on the horse 's back that is causing his pain , only that he is in agony . He therefore sees the horse as his enemy as much as the man . It 's not unusual for horses used in bullfights to be so badly gored by the bulls that they have to be killed , but only after they have been dragged from the ring and the view of the spectators . -LRB- 4 -RRB- All this suffering makes bullfighting as unacceptable as the many other kinds of animal cruelty which most countries ban , such as cockfighting , dogfighting or any other form of grievous harm inflicted on an animal for ` entertainment ' purposes . -LRB- 2 -RRB- We have these laws because governments have generally acknowledged the truth of Bentham 's words : `` It does n't matter if they can reason ; it does n't matter if they can speak ; what does matter is if they can SUFFER . '' -LRB- 5 -RRB- All nations need to follow through on this principle by making bullfighting illegal , just like any other form of animal torture . 	Bullfighting is a form of animal torture
Many matadors are gored each year . In 2010 , famed matador Julio Aparicio was gored in the throat by a bull during the Festival of Saint Isidro . The bulls horn went through his neck and throat and up through his mouth . Such gruesome scenes , and the risks that matadors must take with their lives , have no place in a modern society . -LRB- 7 -RRB- The culture and audience pressure of bullfighting actually increase the danger for matadors . The bullfighters perceived and praised as ` the best ' are the ones that come closest to the bull , letting its horns pass inches by the fighters side , etc . . The greater the risk for the bullfighter , the greater the reward from the crowd . The bullfighter is not trying to stay as far away as possible in order to make a riskless kill ; they are trying to demonstrate their courage and bravery in the face of potentially fatal risks . -LRB- 8 -RRB- In Spain and most other countries with bullfighting , the horns of bulls are not shaved , but rather kept sharp , increasing the danger for the matador . -LRB- 8 -RRB- The state bans many other kinds of activities on the grounds that they are harmful to the participants : taking narcotics is illegal , driving without a seatbelt is illegal , and in many countries even legal guns are required to be fitted with safety devices to protect the user . This is yet another instance where , if the state did not step in , individuals would enter into certain activities which would be harmful to them . The need for the state is especially keen here due to the pressure to take risks put on matadors and others by the audience and the bullfighting community , which may lead many of them to take risks , and suffer injuries , they otherwise would not , for fear of losing ` face ' . Bullfighting is just too dangerous to humans to allow , and so the state should step in and ban bullfighting to protect all those involved . 	Bullfighting is too dangerous to humans to justify
The legislative framework and historical behavior governing and guiding the operation of big business is geared towards maximizing shareholder returns . This propensity has been demonstrated time and again and might suggest that the GM companies are not modifying the food in the interests of better health , but of better profit . This is reinforced by the nature of many of the GM modifications , including terminator seeds -LRB- infertile seed requiring a re-purchase of seed stock each season -RRB- , various forms of pest and herbicide resistance potentially leading to pests -LRB- and weeds -RRB- resistant to the current crop of chemical defenses . One of the more disturbing manifestations of this is the licensing of genes that are naturally occurring and suing those who dare to grow them , even if they are there because of cross contamination by wind-blown seeds or some other mechanism . One has only to look at the history of corporations under North American and similar corporations law to see the effect of this pressure to perform on behalf of the shareholder . The pollution of water supplies , the continued sale of tobacco , dioxins , asbestos , and the list goes on . Most of those anti-social examples are done with the full knowledge of the corporation involved . The example of potato farmers in the US illustrates big company dependence : `` By '' opening and using this product , '' it is stated , that farmers only have the license to grow these potatoes for a single generation . The problem is that the genes remain the intellectual property of Monsanto , protected under numerous United States patents -LRB- Nos . 5,196,525 , 5,164,316 , 5,322,938 and 5,352,605 -RRB- , under these patents , people are not allowed to save even crop for next year , because with this they would break Federal law of intellectual property . 	GMOs would create too much dependency on biotechnology companies
There are two problems associated with scientifically testing the impact of genetically modifying food . The first is that ` Peer review ' -LRB- the checking of scientific test results by fellow scientists -RRB- is often made impossible by the unwillingness of biotechnology companies to give up their results for review . Furthermore , government agencies are often unwilling to stop GM foodstuffs reaching the shelf because of the clout that the companies have with their government . So in regards to research , there have not yet been unbiased findings showing that GMO crops are safe . It is true , that in the US , there have been no adverse consequences from over 500 field releases in the United States . U.S. Department of Agriculture -LRB- USDA -RRB- evaluated in 1993 data on genetically modified organisms regarding safety claims . The Union of Concerned Scientists -LRB- UCS -RRB- believes that the USDA evaluation was too small scale , to actually asses the risks . Also many reports also failed to mention or even measure any environmental risks connected with GM food commercialisation . Also , there are a number of dangers associated with the food itself , even without scientific evaluations . For example , the addition of nut proteins to soybeans caused those with nut allergies to go into shock upon eating the soybeans . Although this was detected in testing , sooner or later a transferred gene will cause risk to human health because the scientists did not conceive it could be a problem . This will become a greater problem as more modifications are introduced . There are also possible dangers associated with the scientific technique itself by which the DNA is modified , an example is the spread of antibiotic resistance . 	Genetically modified food is too new and little researched to be allowed for public use .
GM foods also present a danger to the environment . The use of these crops is causing fewer strains to be planted . In a traditional ecosystem based on 100 varieties of rice , a disease wiping out one strain is not too much of a problem . However , if just two strains are planted -LRB- as now occurs -RRB- and one is wiped out the result is catastrophic . In addition , removing certain varieties of crops causes organisms , which feed on these crops , to be wiped out as well , such as the butterfly population decimated by a recent Monsanto field trial . This supports the concerns that GM plants or transgenes can escape into the environment and that the impacts of broad-spectrum herbicides used with the herbicide tolerant GM crops on the countryside ecosystems have consequences . One of the impacts was that the toxin was produced by Bt crops -LRB- GMOs -RRB- on no-target species -LRB- butterflies -RRB- , which lead to them dying . Another concern is also that pollen produced from GM crops can be blown into neighboring fields where it fertilizes unmodified crops . This process -LRB- cross-pollination -RRB- pollutes the natural gene pool . This in turn makes labeling impossible which reduces consumer choice . This can be prevented with the terminator gene . However , use of this is immoral for reasons outlined below . Furthermore , not all companies have access to the terminator technology . 	Genetically modified food is a danger to eco-systems .
Current copyright law assigns too many rights , automatically , to the creator . Law gives the generator a work full copyright protection that is extremely restrictive of that works reuse , except when strictly agreed in contracts and agreements . Making the Creative Commons license the standard for publicly-funded works generates a powerful normalizing force toward a general alteration of peoples defaults on what copyright and creator protections should actually be like . The creative commons license guarantees attribution to the creator and they retain the power to set up other for-profit deals with distributors , something that is particularly useful for building programs that need to be maintained . At base the default setting of somehow having absolute control means creators of work often do not even consider the reuse by others in the commons . The result is creation and then stagnation , as others do not expend the time and energy to seek special permissions from the creator . By normalizing the creative commons through the state funding system , more people will be willing to accept the creative commons as their private default . This means greater access to more works , for the enrichment of all . The result is that a norm is created whereby the assumption is that information should be open and shared rather than controlled and owned for profit by an individual or corporation . All governments recognise a right to freedom of information as part of freedom of expression making it the governments responsibility to provide access to public information and many are enabling this through creating freedom of information acts . This is simply another part of that right . About The Licenses , , 2010 , Access to public information is governments responsibility , concludes seminar in Montevideo , , 8 October 2010 , See 	The default of copyright restricts the spreading of information
Everyone benefits and is enriched by open access to resources that the government can provide . A work is the province of its creator in most respects , since it is from the mind and hand of its creator that it is born . But when the state opts to fund a project , it too becomes a part-owner of the ideas and creation that springs forth . The state should thus seek to make public the work it spends taxpayer money to create . This is in exactly the same way that when an employee of a company creates something presuming there is the correct contract the rights to that work go to the company not the employee . The best means for doing this is through mandating that work created with state funding be released under creative commons licenses , which allow the work to be redistributed , re-explored , and to be used as springboards for new , derivative works . This is hampered by either the creator , or the government , retaining stricter forms of copyright , which effectively entitles the holder of the copyright to full control of the work that would not exist had it not been for the largesse of society . If state funded work is to have meaning it must be in the public sphere and reusable by the public in whatever form they wish . Simply put taxpayer bought so they own it . Harper , Georgia K. , Who owns what ? , , 2007 , 	If the public funds a product it belongs to them
The nature of the internet and mass media is such that many creators can benefit from the freedom and flexibility that creative commons licenses furnish to them . Creative commons provides vast benefits in allowing a creation to have life after its funding has run out or beyond its original specifications . Creative commons means that the original work can be considered to be a building block that can simply be used as a foundation for more applications and modifications . For example in many countries government has for decades produced official maps for the country but these can only be irregularly updated often with a new release of a paper map . However the internet means that maps could easily be regularly updated online by enthusiastic users and volunteers as things change on the ground if those maps were available under creative commons . This is why applications like openstreetmap or google maps -LRB- which is not creative commons but can be easily built upon by creative commons projects -RRB- are now much more successful than traditional mapping and has often forced government map providers to follow suit such as the UKs Ordnance Survey making many of its maps free and downloadable . It is important to recollect that those operating under a creative commons license still maintain control of the marketable aspects of their work and can enter into deals for the commercial distribution of their works .

In today 's world , crimes are no longer confined to single nations and affect the world due to the effects of globalization . An international court is necessary as a global solution to problems that often involve multiple actors ; a permanent international court accounts for all parties involved . For example the Lord 's Resistance Army has been mostly active in Uganda but has often hidden from the Ugandan military by crossing into Southern Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo . Because it is not limited to a specific territory , the ICC has truly global jurisdiction and therefore is most appropriate given the recent rise of international crimes . Joining the ICC would also encourage nations to recognize that crimes are no longer confined to specific borders and that the notion of territoriality provides a dangerously limited view of the scope of crimes today ; ratifying the Rome Statute would force nations to recognize that domestic and international law inevitably interact . The domestic-foreign distinction has allowed states to ignore or commit certain atrocities in the name of national interest . Accessed 14 August 2011 . 	The ICC is the most suited towards the rising nature of crimes in a globalizing world .
The ICC demonstrates that there is an existing legal court that will hold individuals accountable should they decide to commit grave crimes . The mere existence of the court and the possibility of prosecution -LRB- even if not 100 % -RRB- is beneficial in terms of deterring future atrocities . No leader wants to lose power , and an ICC warrant limits the movement and liberties of leaders . This is empirically true in Uganda , high-ranking officials of the Lords Resistance Army specifically cited potential prosecution by the ICC as a reason they put down their arms . LRA officials like Joseph Kony have to spend valuable time on evading the ICC that would otherwise be used to perpetuate crimes , showing that there are still marginal benefits even if leaders themselves are not always apprehended . Scheffer , David and John Hutson . Strategy for U.S . Engagement with the International Criminal Court . , 2008 . . Accessed 14 August 2011 . 	If supported , the ICC will set a precedent and deter leaders from committing crimes against humanity .
The ICC is uniquely beneficial because of its intention to be a permanent force that will always hold people accountable , instead of slowly reacting to crimes after-the-fact . It is intended to be universal and apply to every situation without mandating the creation of a new tribunal every time something happens , and may be even more effective than tribunals at responding to crimes . Even though tribunals such as the ones for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda may have worked , they were `` necessarily limited in scope '' and can not be applied on a large scale , which is what is needed . Additionally , those tribunals were relatively ineffective , as they took two years to set up , and relying on establishing new tribunals every single time wastes precious time . Doing so would also let smaller but still serious crimes slip under the radar , as they would not warrant the creation of a new tribunal , but may still count as a crime against humanity . Kirsch , Philippe . `` The International Criminal Court : Current Issues and Perspectives . '' Law and Contemporary Problems , Vol . 64 No . 1 , Winter 2001 , 3-11 . 	The ICC is the best way to prosecute serious crimes because of its permanence ; individual tribunals are not enough .
There is a growing global consensus that crimes against humanity need to be punished , as demonstrated by the tribunals to address the crimes of Yugoslavia and Rwanda . The question is no longer whether we should set up an international court but rather how to best do it , and the ICC gives the international community a framework within which to work to establish a strong courts . Rejection of the ICC has become a symbol of rejection of international norms , and countries that have refused to ratify the Rome Statute in the name of national interest , such as the United States , have been seen as imperialist , isolationist , and against global efforts to tackle important issues .

Efforts to strengthen the ICC will promote global cooperation , norms against crimes , and international stability .
The only way to ensure that leaders get what they deserve is to establish a free-standing , independent court that holds people accountable . The ICC acts as a permanent international court -LRB- as opposed to tribunals set up by a specific group of nations -RRB- . By issuing arrest warrants for leaders who would otherwise continue their actions without any blame , the ICC attempts to punish them . The goal is to ensure that no individual gets away with committing terrible crimes . Additionally , the court gives victims a role in the process , has the power to give them reparations , and ensures they see criminals brought to justice . The court has not punished anyone yet because it is still considerably young , but has proceedings going on currently . Carroll , James . `` The International Criminal Court .

Abstinence programs teach teenagers how to have meaningful , age-appropriate relationships , and help young people fight the pressure of having sex before they are ready . We live in a highly sexualized culture , and yet many girls report feeling guilty or regret after their first sexual experience . Indeed , according to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly 30 percent of sexually active teens said they feel pressured to have sex . Abstinence-only education teaches adolescents that they do not need to rush into sexual relationships by dispelling the notion that sex is something teenagers should be having , and by helping young people explore other ways of being emotionally intimate . By leaving out discussions of sex , it reassures teenagers that they do not need to think or worry about sex until they are older , and avoids giving the impression that sex is an important or relevant topic for children . 	Abstinence-only education teaches young people that they do not need to have sex to fit in .
Monogamous sex is much safer than polygamous sex , as it reduces the chance of obtaining and spreading STIs . Furthermore , sex outside of marriage makes it more difficult to develop intimate and trusting relationships . Random sexual partners who are unsure of each others fidelity can not develop the same type of unique and personal relationship that a committed couple can . Numerous studies have shown that this is the case ; having more partners increases the STD risk . And , sex before marriage goes against cultural and religious principles . Abstinence education rightly teaches teenagers that saving sex for marriage is the best way to be healthful and happy . 	Abstinence-only education rightly teaches saving sex for marriage ( or at least a long term , exclusive relationship ) .
Given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable , it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic . Schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education : sex education is a separate , much more personal , issue . Telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want , and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire . This is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway : A Zogby International poll of U.S. parents found that 78 % of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use . 	Parents , not schools , should teach their children about sex .
Although most previous evidence supporting abstinence-only education failed to meet high scientific standards , a recent study has presented what the Washington Post calls the first clear evidence that abstinence-only education really can work . The federally funded study found that only about a third of 6 and 7 graders receiving abstinence-only education had sex over the following two years , whereas nearly half of 6 and 7 graders attending other classes became sexually active . And , abstinence-only education did not affect condom usage -LRB- confirming what the Mathematica Policy Research study cited by the Opposition also found ! -RRB- . This suggests that good abstinence-only programs -LRB- this one , for example , did not condemn condoms -RRB- implemented at a young age , do have real effects on young peoples sexual activity . 	Abstinence-only education deters people from having sex at a young age .
Sex carries with it a multitude of risks and responsibilities . All sex even protected has the possibility of leading to STIs or pregnancy , both of which have huge psychological , emotional , and physical impacts . Furthermore , sex can create emotional bonds between individuals which are overwhelming and intense . Young people are simply not emotionally or physically mature enough to take such risks , or accept such responsibilities , and so it is irresponsible to teach anything abstinence . 	It is irresponsible to teach anything but abstinence to children too young for sex .
Victims of violent crimes and their families face an emotional and vulnerable time in the wake of such crimes . People need time to recover , or mourn . The medias fixation on violent crimes subjects these vulnerable people to the assault of reporters . In fact , there exists a perverse incentive for the media to badger families until they break down , as tears sell . Such exploitation must be stopped , and the best way to do that is to deny the media the ability to report on such things . The media does not care about hurting feelings , and bad behavior on the part of reporters never hurts readership of media outlets , as is indicative of such tabloids as the . Outlets can always deflect any backlash that might occur for their excesses by cutting loose rogue reporters . Furthermore , families and victims usually do not want the media 's , and the nations eyes upon them . Rather they tend to seek support from family and community , not the faceless masses . People generally want to mourn in their own way . They may not want to become part of a media-driven narrative , and certainly not to become symbols for a new social crusade to reform communities . Removing violent reporting removes these perverse incentives to irritate victims and families , and instead leads to more respectful and considerate treatment . As for those accused of crimes , it can be hard for someone acquitted after a trial or accusation to get on with life . Some people may find themselves roundly accused by the media and public , even portrayed as monster , making it very hard to move on , even when their names are officially cleared . This is completely contrary to how the legal system should function , where acquittal is meant to deliver absolution . Allowing the media to construct narratives of guilt in the absence of evidence undermines the very fabric of justice . The medias incessant coverage of violent crimes and its alacrity to make accusations and jump to conclusions can destroy someones life , more than even having to stand trial does . Justice must prevail and be fair to those to whom it judges in court , and this can only be done by not allowing the media to turn the mob against people even after their names are cleared . Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime . Victims and the Media . 2011 , 	The state owes a duty of protection to victims , victims families , and those accused of committing crimes
Judges and juries have to be neutral when they preside in court , and no bias can enter the courts discourse and deliberation if justice is to be done . This is especially true of violent crime , for two reasons . First , in such cases , the court is dealing with peoples lives , as violent crime convictions yield high sentences , and the courts decisions often have a lasting effect on the physical wellbeing of both victims and perpetrators of such crimes . Second , the visceral nature of violent crime naturally causes an emotive response from people hearing about it , which can cause them to act less rationally . Opinion is thus more easily colored in deliberations over violent crime than with any other kind . In light of these facts it is necessary to analyze the behavior of the media when it reports on violent crimes . The media is a commercial enterprise . It prioritizes sales over truth , and always wants to sell the good story and to get the scoop . For this reason the media relishes the opportunity to sell the blood and guts of violent crime to its audience . Furthermore , the race to get stories first causes reporters and media outlets to jump to conclusions , which can result in the vilification of suspects who are in fact innocent . The media sensationalizes the extent of crime through its extreme emphasis on the violence ; it builds its stories on moving imagery , emotive language , and by focusing on victims and their families . At the same time the media seeks to portray itself as being of the highest journalistic quality . This behavior on the part of the media is tremendously bad for the legal process . The media circus surrounding violent crime necessarily affects potential jurors , judges , lawyers , and the general public . This has been observed on many occasions ; for example , after the OJ Simpson trial some jurors admitted that the pressure generated by the media added significantly to the difficulties of deliberation . The inescapable consequence of the media reporting on violent crimes is that people can not help internalizing the public opinion when it stands against a person on trial . Thus court judgments in the presence of a media circus must be held suspect . By restricting reporting on violent crime , however , the pressure can be relieved and the legal process can function justly . Tyagi , Himanshu . Emotional Responses Usually Take Over Rational Responses in Decision-Making . . 16 February 2007 , Lee , Martin and Norman Solomon . . New York : Lyle Stuart . 1990 . 	Reporting on violent crimes compromises the integrity and fairness of law
The media has been consistently demonstrated through empirical evidence to aid in the exacerbation of premeditated violence . There is an observable contagion effect , as the media serves to spread the virus of violence . Studies have shown that the greater the level of media coverage , the shorter the lag time between initial crime and emulations of them . In the case of terrorism , there is a demonstrable clustering effect . The 1970s embassy takeovers in Middle East , for example , show how media coverage can encourage terrorists to emulate past actions that gained attention in the past . People see success of certain kinds of attacks and seek to repeat them . For example , the successes of Fatah in Israel led to the formation of the German Red Army Faction that would be responsible for many terrorist activities . In the case of serial killers and mass murders , the media generates the hot death story of the moment , leading to an observable clustering effect , much as occurs with terrorism . For example , the Virginia Tech shooter cited the Columbine shooters as his inspiration . Serials killers are often attention-seeking individuals who crave media attention , which they are obligingly given . An example of this is the Unabomber , who ramped up his parcel-bombing campaign as a result of the media attention given to Timothy McVeighs mass murder in Oklahoma City . The media not reporting on violent crimes means eliminating the problem of emulation , and stops feeding killers pathologies . Nacos , Brigitte . Revisiting the Contagion Hypothesis : Terrorism , News Coverage , and Copycat Attacks . Perspectives on Terrorism 3 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 2009 . 	The contagion effect of reporting on violence leads to increased impetus for terrorist attacks and serial killings
Constant reporting on violent crime makes people more fearful . This not a deliberate effort on the part of the media to keep people afraid , but rather is a corrosive negative externality ; violence sells , so media provides , resulting in the scaring of audiences . The result of the medias reporting on violent crimes is a constant iteration of fear , which makes people wary of each other , and of the world . Furthermore , such reporting creates a feeling in people of other individuals and groups most often reported as committing crimes as being other from themselves . For example , reporting on extensive crimes in inner-city areas in the United States has caused middle class suburbanites to develop wariness toward African-Americans , who are constantly reported in the media as criminals . This is socially destructive in the extreme . The heightened senses of insecurity people feel leads to vigilance in excess . This is bad for peoples rationality . All these problems yield very negative social consequences . The constant reporting on violence leads to people demanding immediate law enforcement , and politicians quick to oblige , which leads to a ratchet effect , a precipitous increase in punishments for crimes . This results in a severe misallocation of resources ; first in terms of irrationally high spending on extra policing , and second in terms of the excessive allocation of resources and authority to the state to solve the problems of crime through force . This is observed , for example , in the enactment of the PATRIOT Act , which was acclaimed in a state of fear after 9/11 , and which gave extensive , even draconian powers to the state in the name of security . The media fuels this hysteria . Without its influence , cooler heads can prevail . The end result of all this is a treating of symptoms rather than the cause . Putting more police on the streets , and getting tough on crime fail to address underlying issues , which are often poverty and the social ills arising from it . Citizens and governments should instead face the actual problem instead of choosing flashy option . Rogers , Tom .

There have been many suggested motives for Russias sending military forces into Crimea . Providing a lease on Crimea to Russia would provide a solution to most of Russias main objectives ; the Russians in Crimea are protected , and the Russian hold on its Black Sea base is secure . More importantly the crisis started after the defeat of President Yanukovych and the resulting blow to Russian prestige in what Russia sees as a zero sum game -LRB- if one side wins the other automatically loses to the same extent -RRB- . An invasion or Crimea regained Russian leverage but left Russia with little room to manoeuvre as any climb-down would leave Putin with nothing . A lease gets out of this zero sum problem as both can gain . A lease would enable Russia to make an agreement with the Ukrainian government and recognise that government without having to lose face as any other solution which maintains Ukrainian territorial integrity would .

The idea that corporations can , effectively , buy words and phrases set a pernicious precedent similar to their ability to own genes . There are certain things that , self-evidently , are the property of the people . They are held in common and in trust for future generations . They can not be sold because they are not owned . Attempts to evade that reality have , generally , been seen as pernicious by history even where they have not been rectified . European settlers laying claim to land used by indigenous people would be one example . Recent attempts by pharmaceutical companies to purchase genes and now other Corporations to own chunks of the language or at least rent them from governments and NGOs that also dont own them in the first place - seems to come in a similar spirit . Who can reasonably be said to own , for example , the phrase London 2012 ? If anybody could make such a claim , Londoners living in the city in 2012 would seem to be the obvious answer . However , there is a far more satisfying answer that nobody does . The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 extends the scope of protection given to the Olympic and Paralympic Games by making it an infringement of the London Olympic Association Right -LRB- LOAR -RRB- to do anything which is likely to create in the public mind an association with the London Olympics . The fact that this is happening in relation to the Olympics makes the precedent particularly troubling as the idea that the Games are for all mankind is at the heart of the Olympic ideal . It is an aspiration of our common humanity and all that entails . If chunks of that are for sale then it raises very real concerns about what else could go under the hammer . 	This creates a dangerous precedent
Smaller businesses and other organisations see their freedom of expression worst hit by laws that prevent them from associating themselves in any way with major events , to the detriment of their communities . Free speech is not relative or conditional and certainly should not be determined on the basis of the thickness of someones chequebook . In this regard , freedom of information is a very real issue . Those organisations without access to huge legal departments are hardest hit , further disadvantaging them against corporations who can already outspend them on advertising . Free speech means that in the world of words and ideas , at least , there is an even playing field and undermining that runs against a sense of natural justice . Sponsors are simply using this to increase an already fairly unfair advantage ; many people supported Britains bid for the games on the basis that it would offer great benefits to local businesses , legislation restricting their ability to use their geographical and cultural association with the event make that pledge look extremely hollow . One of the noticeable failings of the Games is just how little positive impact they have had for small business in East London where most of the events are being held added to this , 62 % of small businesses think the games will have no impact while 25 % believe the impact will be negative and business outside the capital have actually suffered as a result . The major sponsors already went into this situation with massive advantages over small traders who had the sole advantage of the geographical proximity to the events . The idea that , for example , Coca Cola can prevent street vendors in the Olympic Village from selling Pepsi is absurd . Coke isnt planning to make their money back on direct sales of their product around venues but on the prestige it brings them as a global brand . 	Those unable to respond will be worst hit
Recent developments in IP legislation , particularly in the UK , have given corporations a carte blanche with regards to protecting their claim on associations with events they are sponsoring . The Olympics , for example , has required vastly more investment from the taxpayer than from any sponsor and yet those very taxpayers have been prevented from using associations with the event to their advantage . The build-up to the games saw the international media full of stories of small businesses and others banned from using the logo or name of the games for their own advantage . Sponsors may have ploughed in millions but the taxpayers has invested billions , many of them will see precious little return on that investment and this is exacerbated by the official sponsors buying those terms . Effectively government has conspired with corporations to own chunks of language which morally , linguistically and financially can be said to belong to the public . Nobody would challenge the right of sponsors to proudly promote their bought association with an event they are sponsoring and to use all of the means at their disposal to declare that association to the world , which they have done . However , there is a world of difference between the positive right to proclaim a particular association and the negative right to prevent anyone else from proclaiming theirs . Of course sponsorship should provide bragging rights and privileged access but that is a world away from buying the silence of others . 	Governments and corporations have been complicit in an effective privatization of language .
The economic , social , and political history of the region show there are many obstacles to establishing stable democracies in the Middle East . Many in the West fear that Islam is among these barriers , with claims that Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Ennahda in Tunisia will turn their countries into theocracies like Iran . However , there are majority-Muslim states with Islamist parties that have succeeded in creating stable democracies , including Turkey and Indonesia . Both countries are good case studies that disprove the widespread notion that Islam is incompatible with democracy . Turkey is most often cited as a good example for the Arab spring to follow . The election of the AKP has shown that an Islamic party can also uphold democracy , so providing a good example for the powerful Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab world . Elections are free and fair and the press is relatively free . The Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has faced down coup threats from the military , again something that may well be necessary given the large role the military has had in the previous regimes . Turkeys economy is growing briskly and Turkey is following a foreign policy of reaching out to everybody and is touting itself as a model for Arab countries to follow . In Indonesia in 1998 there was a revolution that ousted President Suharto who had like Mubarak been in power for thirty years . This revolution progressed in a very similar way to the ongoing revolution in Egypt in both countries the protesters were middle class and young , the president went relatively peacefully and the military helped during the transition . Indonesia is now the largest Muslim democracy in the world and while there are islamist parties in parliament their support is now below 30 % . Indonesia can therefore provide a road map for moving from an interim government with the military in control to a fully functioning and successful democracy . 	Islamic parties have led governments before
Many middle eastern states already have institutions that are similar to the representative institutions that a stable democracy needs so can easily become the real thing . Arab dictators have grown adept at holding elections , setting up parliaments ; constitutional courts etc . as window dressing to show either to their people or to the outside world that they are reforming and are democratic . No matter how undemocratic these regimes have been the simple existence of these institutions is useful when there is a revolution as they allow some continuity and the possibility of a transition to democracy . To take Egypt where protests toppled the Mubarak regime as an example . It has a parliament with the Majilis Al-Shaab -LRB- Peoples Assembly -RRB- as its lower house and Majilis Al-Shura -LRB- Shura Council -RRB- as its upper house . In both houses a majority of the members are directly elected . Egypt held elections for its parliament as recently as November 2010 , these elections had very poor turnout and blatant ballot rigging while the main opposition the Muslim Brotherhood have to stand as independents . Egypt also has previously had local elections for 52,000 municipal council seats in some 4,500 towns and cities . These elections are just as fraudulent as those for the national parliament . According to Muslim Brotherhood MP Jamdi Hassan The ruling party used to allow opposition candidates to run and then simply rig the elections . Now , it has adopted a new strategy to ensure its continued domination : preventing the opposition from fielding any candidates at all . This may not be the best democratic tradition but at least it is a start . Similarly Egypt has a Supreme Constitutional Court that is supposed to be independent . While these institutions may have ceased working in a democratic way they could quite easily be changed in to being fully democratic . This would create the necessary checks and balances to sustain democracy over the long term . The people are used to elections and will know what to do when they have the option to vote freely , they would vote in a broad range of candidates . Many of them may be islamist but it would be democratic . 	There are preexisting institutions in Arab countries .
The reason why Moshoeshoe , the leader of Lesotho , wished to become a British protectorate was because of the Boers of the Orange Free State was trying to take their land . In 1966 , when the Kingdom of Lesotho gained its independence from Britain , it remained separate from SA as it had been a separate colony . Lesotho was under direct rule while South Africa was a dominion . There was no incentive to change at the point of independence because SA was ruled by the apartheid regime . Lesotho was a strong public opponent of the regime and granted a number of SA refugees political asylum . The African National Congress , the ruling party in SA since 1994 , was founded in Lesotho . Moreover , during the struggle against apartheid , the ANCs armed wing organized its guerilla units from the enclave . We can firmly say that Lesotho vas a very important actor in a post-apartheid SA , but the times have changed . The ANC is now in power in South Africa and SA and Lesotho are closer together than ever before . Smith , 2010 , 	The historical reasons for which the state of Lesotho exists are no longer relevant in a post-apartheid South Africa
With about 40 % of Basotho people living below the international poverty line , Lesotho needs urgent help both from the economic and social perspective . A third of the population is infected with HIV and in urban areas ; about 50 % of the women under 40 have the virus . There is a major lack of funding and corruption in the system is halting any progress . The Kingdom of Lesotho is clearly unable to deal with its issues and should be annexed by SA . Annexation is the only way in which the SA government is going to care about this enclave territory . Give Basotho citizenship and the right to vote in elections and they will be taken into consideration . Give SA the power to control and they will assume the responsibility for pulling the Basotho out of poverty , giving them a better social system and a country in which they can thrive . A simple look at the GDP per capita of each state shows the potential benefit to Lesotho and ability of SA to deliver . While Lesotho is stable at $ 1,700 per capita , SA has a GDP of $ 10,700 per person . Only by giving them full responsibility of the territory , the SA government is going to step in and make the necessary change . Human Development Reports , , The World Factbook , Lesotho , , 11 March 2014 , 	Lesotho is in a dire condition and needs help from its closest ally
For the Basotho in a landlocked country the free movement of their people is a right that is in large part dependent on the South African -LRB- SA -RRB- government rather their own national one . Its importance is shown by 40 % of border crossings into South Africa being from Lesotho . Acknowledging the fact that Lesotho is an enclave state surrounded by SA , the ability of people to move freely depends on whether they are allowed to enter SA or not . There is corruption at border posts and the number of crossings results in long queues and slow service ; 63 % of border crossers experience problems . This is sometimes made even more difficult by SA government actions as before the World Cup in 2010 when border restrictions were tightened making it almost impossible for Basotho to leave their country . This happened due to the detention of several Lesotho nationals after a spate of criminal activities along the border . The same situation applies to trade . Lesotho is dependent on the trade with South Africa , even for goods that come from beyond South Africa as Lesotho has no port of its own most goods will have to be transported through South Africa . This dependency is rising . In 1980 , Lesotho produced 80 % of the cereals it consumed . Now it imports 70 % . Annexation would eliminate these borders boosting trade between the countries , helping to make both richer . In the best interest of Basotho is to be able to control and be listened to by the entity that is metaphorically and literally feeding them . Crush , Jonathan , The border within : The future of the Lesotho-South African international boundary , , Patel , Khadija , Lesotho and South Africa : Good fences make good neighbours , 19 April 2013 , Smith , Alex Duval , Lesotho 's people plead with South Africa to annex their troubled country , , 6 June 2010 	Annexation will allow the free movement of Basotho people , goods and services
Bringing South Africa and Lesotho will benefit SA on the global stage . The move would be one to provide aid to a smaller state and provide stability . The dire conditions for the Basotho people are acknowledged by the UN and the Africa Union . Firstly , SA , by the annexation of Lesotho , will prove good intentions in creating a sustainable Sub-Saharan Africa . This will ultimately create a better image and a greater influence in the region if they choose to respond positively to the Peoples Charter Movement in Lesotho , a social structure pleading for annexation . The movement , driven by trade unions , has collected 30,000 signatures in favor of their goal and is rising in popularity . Secondly the annexation will provide a boost for the South African Development Community and South African Customs Union by demonstrating the willingness of South Africa to integrate with poorer neighbours and take on some of the responsibility for them . Smith , 2010 , 	South Africa will gain influence , stability and a better image on the international stage
The predominant role of tertiary education is skilling people for the workplace . This is done either through direct vocational training or the somewhat more pedagogical shaping of the mind . Universities also provide the setting for acquiring skills of socialization that allow people to function as independent citizens outside the family home . Increasingly both that workplace and that socializing takes place in an international , globalized setting . As a result the greater internationalisation both of education and the wider social setting of the university will result in all graduates being better prepared to compete in the global labour market . At the same time the nation will be benefiting in a similar way . If more international students are attracted to study in university then more are likely to stay in that country resulting in a larger , more knowledgeable workforce , something even countries that are usually against migrants want to encourage . 	An internationalized education is necessary to producing global problem solvers
Once people leave compulsory education the relationship they have with the state changes dramatically . The state no longer has so great a duty of care . Their option , other than going to university , would normally be to get a job . In doing so they are in an open competition . It seems unreasonable that universities should not treat them in the same way as a company would . Universities , like companies , should therefore have to compete for the best academic talent and there should be a level playing field in this competition rather than setting quotas or giving a leg up for students whether it is for the poor or for those native to the country where the university is located . Universities work on an international basis already with different specialisms , costs and reputations in international marketplace . This is simply the logical conclusion of that . 	Just as with applying for a job , a studentship should go to the best candidate based on academic ability
If universities are expected to become increasingly self-funding -LRB- in the case of many nations they already are entirely self-funded -RRB- it is unfair to restrict whatever advantages they may have to succeed . Equally those universities in a country which simply arent up to scratch should not be guaranteed the luxury of an inbuilt base of domestic students . A free and open market would improve the education provided to student both domestic and foreign by refining the tertiary sector through competition . Those universities which are failing will have to improve standards if they are to retain their students . At the moment foreign students often pay more , for example for 2012/13 entry into Oxford to do biological sciences overseas students pay 18550 while home students pay 9000 . Therefore the real rate the university would charge if it was attempting to break even while making a level playing field for global talent would be somewhere between these two levels . As a result there will both be more competition to get into the best universities ; so driving up educational standards among school leavers , and more among universities who will also be competition for the domestic market . 	Higher Education increasingly is a marketplace and if governments expect universities to compete in that it is unfair to restrict how they do so
The vertical separation of powers , under which the federal government possesses limited and enumerated powers , while the States wield general powers -LRB- including the right to operate their own police forces -RRB- , is a key part of America 's constitutional architecture . Far from being an 18th century affectation , these structural limitations on government powers were designed to protect individual liberty . In the Framers ' view , limiting the ability of the federal government to exercise authority was core to ensuring that no single government entity would grow too powerful . This is because , under the Supremacy Clause , any constitutionally compliant federal legislation trumps exercises of individual states powers . Therefore , an infinitely capacious Commerce Clause -LRB- which would be produced if the mandating of healthcare were to be allowed -RRB- would rob States of any remaining authority . -LRB- 8 -RRB- When any choice or non-action which has economic impacts becomes termed as economic , every aspect of consumer behaviour , or , for that matter , any aspect of individual behaviour , would become an economic activity , and thus nothing would fall outside of Congress ' power to regulate under the commerce clause . -LRB- 8 -RRB- The individual health insurance mandate would set dangerous precedents for federal power . The Congressional Budget Office acknowledged the unprecedented nature of an individual mandate when assessing the Clinton health care reform proposal of 1993 : A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action . The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States . An individual mandate has two features that , in combination , make it unique . First , it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society . Second , it would require people to purchase a specific service that would have to be heavily regulated by the federal government . '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- The ` commerce clause on steroids ' , as imagined by supporters of the healthcare mandate , would fundamentally warp America 's constitutional architecture . Because every single decision by individual Americans , be it buying health insurance , cars , health club memberships or any other good or service , has some impact on the economy , it could be subject to regulation by Congress . Indeed , Congress would be able to dictate how individuals would dispose of every penny of whatever monies they have left after paying taxes , transforming Americans into . -LRB- 8 -RRB- For all these reasons the individual healthcare mandate would give too much power to the federal government , in ways which are antithetical to the Constitution as the Founders envisioned it and set it out -LRB- with restricted and separate powers -RRB- , and so it should be deemed unconstitutional . 	The individual mandate gives too much power to the Federal Government
It is unconstitutional to require individuals to buy private insurance , and penalize them for not doing so -LRB- that is , penalizing their non-act , their omission to purchase insurance -RRB- . As David B. Rivkin Jr. and Lee A. Casey argue : Can Congress require every American to buy health insurance ? In short , no . The Constitution assigns only limited , enumerated powers to Congress and none , including the power to regulate interstate commerce or to impose taxes , would support a federal mandate requiring anyone who is otherwise without health insurance to buy it . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The Congressional Budget Office believes a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action . The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States . -LRB- 2 -RRB- An individual mandate would have two features that , in combination , would make it unique . First , it imposes a duty on individuals due to them being members of society . Second , it requires the purchase of a specific service on pain of tax penalties if that product is not purchased . -LRB- 2 -RRB- As noted by Sen. John Ensign , a Nevada Republican : `` Anything we have ever done , somebody actually had to have an action before we could tax or regulate it . '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- As Robert A . Levy and Michael F. Cannon of the CATO Institute argue : Congress ' attempt to punish a non-act that harms no one is an intolerable affront to the Constitution , liberty , and personal autonomy . That shameful fact can not be altered by calling it health-care reform . -LRB- 4 -RRB- The individual healthcare insurance mandate would , for the first time , mean the government setting uo a monopoly or a cartel with which every citizen of the US would be compelled - by a statutory power - to do business . This destroys any pretence of individual market freedom , individuals would be required to contribute money out of each and every pay check they earned to either a government entity which would be staffed and/or controlled by political appointees or to a cartel made up of companies that would owe their continued existence on the cartel list to the acquiescence of political overseers . Either way , the reduction in individual autonomy and freedom over health care choices would be dramatically decreased and inevitably politicized . This has obvious worrying possibilities for corruption , the party in power would favour those who donate to the party . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Enforcing the mandate may also intrude on Constitutional rights . Sherry Glied , Ph.D. , Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has warned , -LSB- d -RSB- eveloping a system to promptly identify and penalize scofflaws -LSB- people who flout the law -RSB- will take effort and ingenuity , particularly in our diverse and mobile country . It may require a degree of intrusiveness and bureaucracy that some will find unpalatable . -LRB- 6 -RRB- This is likely to mean much more intrusive inspection , for example hospitals having to report to the government patients they have who dont have health insursnce . . -LRB- 6 -RRB- This is why a majority of the states , and numerous organizations and individual persons , have filed actions in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate , and several courts have already struck it down on constitutional grounds . -LRB- 7 -RRB- For all these reasons it is clear that for Congress to try to penalize a non-act is an unprecedented and unconstitutional power grab , and so the individual mandate is unconstitutional . 	Penalizing a non-act is unconstitutional
Many attorneys general have fought constitutionality of mandates . Since the passage of the legislation in March of 2010 , have pressed forward with lawsuits centred on the idea that the individual mandate in the legislation is unconstitutional . -LRB- 7 -RRB- Underlying these legal challenges is a debate about the basis of the national Congresss lawmaking powers . In order for laws passed by Congress to be considered legitimate and enforceable , those laws must be based on a power conferred on congress by the Constitution . On those areas of law and public life where the Constitution is silent , legislative power rests not in the hands of Congress , but rather is reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . -LRB- 9 -RRB- It has been argued that the individual healthcare mandate is authorised by the Constitution 's empowerment of Congress to regulate interstate commerce -LRB- known as the commerce clause -RRB- , however this is not true and the commerce clause does not authorize health insurance mandates . As the Congressional Research Service has written : `` Despite the breadth of powers that have been exercised under the Commerce Clause , it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance . Whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal , as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The most obvious reason for this is that an omission to buy health insurance can in no way be termed ` interstate commerce ' , as there is no activity or commerce going on . This is not in keeping with the commerce clause , unlike other previous federal healthcare laws . There is no doubt that Congress can regulate an entire array of economic activities , large and small , inter - and intra-state . Thus , for example , there is no problem , Constitution-wise with having Congress regulate health care insurance transactions . The problem with an individual insurance purchase mandate , however , is that it does not regulate any transactions at all ; it regulates human beings , simply because they exist , and orders them to engage in certain types of economic transactions . -LRB- 8 -RRB- While most health care insurers and health care providers may engage in interstate commerce and may be regulated accordingly under the Commerce Clause , it is a different matter to find a basis for imposing Commerce Clause related regulation on an individual citizen who chooses not to undertake a commercial transaction . The decision not to engage in affirmative conduct is arguably distinguishable from cases in which Commerce Clause regulatory authority was recognized over intra-state activity : growing wheat , for example , -LRB- Wickard v. Filmore -RRB- or , more recently , growing marijuana -LRB- Gonzales v. Raich -RRB- . -LRB- 6 -RRB- If Congress were to invoke its Commerce Clause authority to support legislation mandating individual health insurance coverage , such an action would have to contend with recent Supreme Court precedent limiting unfettered use of Commerce Clause authority to police individual behaviour that does not constitute interstate commerce : In the case of a mandate to purchase health insurance or face a tax or penalty , Congress would have to explain how not doing something not buying insurance and not seeking health care services implicated interstate commerce . -LRB- 6 -RRB- Therefore , it is clear that Congress is not empowered to regulate the choice not to buy healthcare , as it lacks constitutional authorisation to interfere in this aspect of individual Americans private lives . 	The mandate is not constitutional under the commerce clause
Wikipedia exists to provide free , open and easy access to information and knowledge . Its goal is to distribute a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in their own language , and to an astonishing degree -LRB- it -RRB- is succeeding . It already has over 3.5 million articles in English alone . This is more than ten times those of Encyclopaedia Britannica , its nearest printed rival . Traditionally , reference works were very expensive , which meant previously that knowledge was restricted to the wealthy , or those with access to well-funded public libraries . Wikipedia liberates that knowledge and provides volumes of online information to anyone with access to a computer , or even a smartphone , and the internet . Its impact is only restrained by the reach of internet providers and the desire of people to learn . Users do not need to be able to afford particular print objects but can access contents of Wikipedia from any location with Internet connectivity . 	Wikipedia provides free , open access to knowledge
Wikipedia pools information that previously was spread far and wide in cyberspace into one readily accessible location . Enquiries will not and should not end at Wikipedia , but it provides accessible background information as well as links to additional research and publication on a topic and is , therefore , an obvious starting point . Nobody at Wikipedia has claimed that it is a definitive account of human knowledge or a replacement for in-depth research . But it gives a quick guide to an unknown subject and points the enquirer on to more specialist sources . It is used to good effect by students , teachers , journalists and even judges , among many others showing it is a valued reference source . Experienced users can quickly assess the quality of an article from its written quality and the thoroughness of its references , so they need not accept its content out of hand . Nothing on the internet should ever be accepted uncritically , but Wikipedia has earned its reputation as a valuable starting resource . 	Wikipedia is an excellent starting point for enquiries
A key principle for Wikipedia is to present information as neutrally as possible . This has led to Wikipedia being banned in China , after Jimmy Wales refused to censor articles to make the site acceptable to the Chinese government . Wikipedia , thus , epitomizes the principle that all should have access to the necessary information required not just to live , but also enjoy and cherish our lives . As such , Wikipedia is not threatened by variants and rivals that also seek to promote freedom of knowledge because it views them as partners to a mutual goal , not rivals . Its founder , Jimmy Wales , readily acknowledges it will eventually be superseded by another way of sharing knowledge on a mass level . 	Wikipedia enshrines the principle of freedom of information
The process of collaboration required to create and maintain an up-to-date , factual source of information encourages democratic practices and principles . Wikipedia seeks to achieve its democratic goal of the spread of free , open material by democratic means . As an open-source project it relies upon the collaboration of tens of thousands of people who constantly add , check and edit articles . Disagreements and disputes are sent up the line to moderators , who oversee the editing process . This socialisation of expertise as David Weinberger puts it ensures that errors and omissions are rapidly identified and corrected and that the site is constantly and accurately updated . No traditional encyclopaedia can match this scrutiny . Indeed , Wikipedia has the potential to be the greatest effort in collaborative knowledge gathering the world has ever known , and it may well be the greatest effort in voluntary collaboration of any kind . Not only do such democratic processes encourage democracy more generally , but they are an effective means to create a user-friendly product , as illustrated by open source software such as Firefox and Linux . 	Collaboration in editing encourages democratic principles
Through the process by which its articles are constructed , Wikipedia supports notions of revision , collaboration , and authority that many academics value and helps to make visible the knowledge-making process . With its Discussion and History pages , Wikipedia illustrates the peer review process academic writing goes through as well as the iterative , recursive nature of public writing . Thus , it can disabuse students of the notion that good writing happens in isolation in one sitting . Therefore , Wikipedia can be an excellent teaching tool . 	Wikipedia models , in an accessible form , the process of knowledge creation through writing .
A sensible Libertarian position accepts the rights of people to do whatever they like as long as it doesnt infringe upon the life of anyone else . That may sound like something that anyone could sign up to but the reality is not so simple . The Right may defend corporate greed and the Left government intervention but there is a clearer principle ; I have the right not to have my air poisoned by your chemical company which means I dont have to pay for any government body to clear up the mess . The Oglala Sioux activist and actor , Russell Means has argued that A libertarian society would not allow anyone to injure others by pollution because it insists on individual responsibility . All too often the line between consumer and citizen is blurred because the interest of both state and private actors have become conjoined leaving little or no room for the individual between them . A libertarian approach would break that cozy consensus . 	Neither citizen nor subject , consumer nor customer : the supremacy of the individual
One of principal reasons for the growth of libertarian parties , especially in the West , is the dominance of one particular ideological viewpoint that is broadly shared by all the major parties . As a result anyone who does not share this viewpoint are effectively disenfranchised and have the world view of a de facto governing class imposed upon them . The only sensible response is to reduce the impact of that government altogether . Indeed in the United States , where the libertarian argument has been made most vociferously , the entire political system is designed on the predicate of a minimalist state and is poorly designed to deal with the behemoth that the Federal Government has become . 	There is very little meaningful choice left in many societies with the major parties all singing from the same score
A libertarian agenda is one that draws people from across the political spectrum . The crisis in the financial sector has confirmed for many that government and large financial institutions have simply got too close . Republicans say they can reduce the size of government but never do , Democrats say they can regulate corporations but show no sign of doing so . The primary reason why people can approach libertarianism from across the political spectrum is that , as a philosophy , it doesnt seek to judge individual policies . So policies traditionally associated with the left the legalization of drugs or gay rights as well as those of the right - independence for schools and reducing taxation both fall within a Libertarian agenda that simply says that none of these issues are any business of the state . 	A growing alliance that defies party lines and the definitions of the last century
PresidentObamafamouslyeschewedlargecorporatedonorsinfavorofgrassroots fundraising and social media in 2008 , casting a wide net of supporters . By election day his facebook page had 3.4 million supporters , his website My.BarackObama.com had 2million members , the campaign had an email list of 13 million and there were 1 million text message subscribers showing how campaigns should be run by mobilizing people not powerful interests . Following a similar strategy , the 2012 campaign garnered hundreds of thousands supporters in the first several months , shattering 2008 records . President Obama has stated in the public record his support for increased disclosure for corporate and individual donors as well as efforts to limit the high-value contributions from corporations that are permitted under In response to the supreme court decision on Citizens United v Federal Election Commission act Obama declared in the 2010 state of the Union I dont think American elections should be bankrolled by Americas most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities . They should be decided by the American people . In a democracy where the government is supposed to be accountable to the people this should be self-evident ; accountable to the people should mean that rather than accountable to corporate interests . 	Elections should be controlled by the people not powerful interests
There is a need to create more parity between individuals and corporations . There is much more campaign funding where there is non-disclosure , there has been little money flowing into super-PACs that must disclose donors instead it goes to tax exempts organizations that are not subject to the disclosure requirements . As non-disclosure means higher fundraising figures , then it becomes optimal for every politician to adopt a strategy of opacity in order to fare better than his or her opponents . The culture of corporate electioneering aided by legally-sanctioned anonymity would likely demoralize voters and funnel candidates priorities towards courting big business at great cost to the average American citizen during and after the election . While it may be a stretch to assert that granted corporations personhood , the impacts of the ruling are far-reaching for campaign finance law . Even small corporations have disproportionate spending power compared to individuals . Oftentimes decisions in corporations are made by boards of executives and not aggregates of working-class citizens , exacerbating the influence of those who already wield greater financial and political capital . If money is indeed speech , then corporations speak much , much louder than individuals from the outset . Some contend that the voices of unions , which are similarly protected under the same ruling , lend a degree of partisan balanceimplicitly acknowledging that the divide is indeed tinged with partisanshipbut realistically , even the largest union contributions pale in comparison to those of Fortune 500 companies . Distortion in the marketplace of ideas increases reliance on negative campaigning , which hurts voter turnout and morale while usually detracting from substantive dialogue about policy issues . It also raises the barriers of entry for third-party candidates and more moderate candidates during elections and primaries , more deeply entrenching the two-party system . 	More parity is necessary between corporations and the regular individuals .
Disclosure laws are intended to bring transparency to the electoral process . By scrutinizing the sources of campaign funds , voters can gain insight into how candidates intend to appoint justices and pass laws while in office . Obamas attempt at transparency , the DISCLOSE Act , has so far failed to gather a majority of votes in Congress in 2010 but it shows how Obama would like to proceed . This kind of transparency is necessary today because during the 2010 midterms the groups that dont need to disclose contributions outspent the PACs that must disclose donors by 3 to 2 spending $ 100million on issue ads . Without strict disclosure rules , the legislative agendas of elected officials become more opaque , and the public has fewer ways to hold them accountable . Voters would be forced to rely on the goodwill of their elected officials to voluntarily disclose the sources of funding , a system which generates negative incentives to bury the information that is perhaps most critical and relevant to the public interest 	Obama has already attempted to increase transparency .
A cap-and-trade system provides companies with credits if they are able to reduce their emissions below an established level . They can then sell these credits for a profit . So , if a company takes action to reduce its carbon emissions below the designated level , than it can make a profit . This is a powerful market incentive that is more likely to cause companies to invest money in finding ways to reduce their carbon emissions . A carbon tax , conversely , only provides the incentive of cutting costs , and does not offer this important profit motive . With cap-and-trade emissions are much more likely to be meaningfully reduced , specifically because the cap is static and as such nations can choose to raise and lower it as they wish . Within this mechanism , market prices would simply reflect the availability of credits . As such , nations can guarantee a reduction in carbon emissions just by reducing the number of credits in the market . Finally , because cap and trade affects all companies and minimises cost to them , it provides all companies with an incentive to work toward green technology . Under the status quo , where subsidies and research grants are paid to businesses researching emissions reduction technology , the government has to decide which companies are best at solving the ecological damage that industry causes . Other companies feel they dont have to contribute because they are simply being taxed instead . We do not know where the next development in green technology will come from . As such a smaller impetus for everyone is likely to be better than a large impetus for a small number of companies who might not , in any event , be able to develop workable solutions to emissions problems . Mankiw , Gregory , Carbon Tax Problem , 11/04/07 	Cap and Trade is Better at reducing carbon emissions than a carbon tax .
Carbon emitting energy industries emerged long ago , before anyone thought about the environmental impact of this industry . It is wrong to suddenly consider all energy production that involves carbon emissions a social `` harm '' , after decades of thinking to the contrary . Modern energy producers should not be punished for their participation in an industry whose emergence pre-dates concerns of global warming . Further , A cap-and-trade system is `` fair '' because it rewards `` efficient '' - polluters while punishing `` non-efficient '' polluters : Given the above argument , this is a more reasonable approach to rewarding and punishing an industry whose emergence pre-dates the environmental concerns surrounding carbon emissions . 	A Cap and Trade system is fairer to producers
`` The efficiency -LSB- of a cap-and-trade system -RSB- comes with the `` trade '' part . Let 's say you have two power plants , each emitting 100 tons of carbon per hour . The first can reduce its emissions by 20 tons at a cost of $ 5 per ton , and the second can reduce its emissions by only 10 tons , at a cost of $ 30 per ton . Clearly the efficient thing to do is to make the former reduction rather than the latter , with the owner of the second plant paying the owner of the first plant to offset the first owner 's extra costs -LSB- by buying carbon credits and the `` right '' to pollute from the first plant -RSB- . '' This technique allows effective emissions reductions to occur Hence as this is less disruptive to business they are more likely to be on board and not try to get around a cap and trade system using accounting methods in the same way that they might with a tax . A cap-and-trade system is more flexible in the global economy . Nations that adopt a cap-and-trade system can later link that system into other cap-and-trade systems around the world . It would not be as easy for a carbon tax to achieve this . This is important in today 's global economy , where multinational companies exist across borders . As such cap-and-trade is the most viable solution that if implemented could lead to a long term solution and agreement between countries regarding reductions in emissions .

When the IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau stated that mind sports , by their nature , can not be part of the program , she contradicted Olympic history . The Ancient Greek Panhellenic Games -LRB- forerunners of the modern Olympic Games -RRB- indeed emphasised musical , theatrical and painting competitions . Even the modern Olympic Games had non-physical competitions such as painting , design and poetry between 1912 and 1952 .

The sports in the Olympics promote good values : they display attributes and disciplines that we want to encourage in society and children in particular . Chess is no different from this . Numerous studies have shown that chess has large cognitive benefits , strengthening a wide range of skills : problem-solving , decision-making , memory , mathematics , logic , and creative thinking . These are skills we want to actively promote , and thus if including chess in the Olympics would increase its support , we should do so . Making chess an Olympic sport would make it more accessible to people who would otherwise not watch it . It would also incentivise young enthusiasts to become more involved in the hope of participating in such a recognised competition . Bringing chess to a highly recognised event would doubtless increase support , and thus have an objectively positive impact on society . -LSB- 9 -RSB- Dr Dauvergne , Peter .

Chess is among the sports with the greatest number of federations and of active participants worldwide . Its large fan base , however , is completely unrepresented in the worlds largest sports competition . Chess , furthermore , is highly viewer friendly , so its popularity would only flourish from its representation . It is possible to broadcast any game online , for all to watch at home . Games also often feature high commentary action explaining and analysing the players strategies , to make them approachable and exciting to the public . Furthermore , it could take the shape of a team sport in the Olympics , leaving greater space for tactics and discouraging draws , once again making it more appealing for a broad audience . -LSB- 12 -RSB- FIDE World Chess Federation , 8 April 2009 .

Chess is not a predominantly physical sport , yet neither are shooting and curling -LRB- which , in fact , has been nicknamed chess on ice -RRB- . The opposition may respond that the determining factor in these is still physical , such as speed and precision . However , chess too requires precise calculation in short periods of time . There is no relevant distinction to be drawn between the human brain and other organs : both can be trained and strained , and doing so should be equally rewarded . More importantly , taekwondo is a further example of what may be called a mind sport . As in chess , both participants have the same set of moves which can be combined in a near infinite number of ways : it thus becomes a battle of intellect and strategy rather than strength . The body merely becomes the vessel through which to compete , precisely as a chess board . Although the vessels are different , the fundamental activity is the same , and thus if taekwondo is valid as an Olympic sport , so should chess be . -LSB- 5 -RSB- Tomlinson , Brett .

According to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association -LRB- PFMA -RRB- , there are around 8 million dogs and 8 million cats in the UK alone in 2011 . These vast numbers equate to almost half the households in the country owning a pet , and ownership requires feeding , medical care , the dedication of a considerable amount of time and of course , waste disposal . In an economic climate in which food prices are rising at unprecedented levels the question must be asked as to whether we can afford to look after so many animals . Of course , the impact is n't just on the people - in America the recession has hit pet owners very hard , and this has lead to increased instances of abandonment and mistreatment . There is also the wider humanitarian question to consider - with the amount of money spent on looking after pets in comparison to the lack of aid being sent to the poorest nations . 	The keeping of pets results in a huge drain on resources that could be put to better use .
Anything beyond the initial taming of animals for protection and hunting is unnatural . Most of the animal species that we keep as pets can not be ` domesticated ' - they are simply wild animals in captivity . Especially in the case of birds , keeping them as pets greatly limits the experience they would have in the wild , and as Monica Engebretsen argues for Born Free USA , `` Birds are routinely denied two of their most fundamental natural behaviors flying and socialization . Denial of these activities can cause physical and behavioral abnormalities including incessant screaming , pacing , head-bobbing , feather-plucking , and self-mutilation From a basic animal welfare point of view then , many animals which are currently kept as pets are not suited to that lifestyle , and the fact that they are often suffering for no other reason than human gratification is reason enough to stop this from happening . This is also a problem that is growing rather than receding , as zoo vet and government inspector Matt Brash points out : There is a big problem out there . There are an awful lot of exotics in the country . A lot of them are not being kept properly '' . These animals are not only being kept in unsuitable conditions which damages their health , but they are also a serious risk to any humans they come into contact with . 	Keeping pets , especially those of a more exotic species , is unnatural and detrimental to the welfare of the animals .
This debate raises questions about the similarities and differences between human beings and other animals . An article in the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy argues that `` humans are morally considerable because of the distinctively human capacities we possess , capacities that only we humans have '' . If this is the case , then should we apply our unique morality to animals who have no consideration of it - should we be able to decide to keep them in an unnatural environment that they have no understanding of ? Many animal rights groups would argue that `` Pets are our property . Dogs , cats , hamsters , rabbits , and other animals are mass produced like bolts '' and that this is wrong . Living creatures deserve the basic rights which captivity denies even though they may have no moral comprehension of their experiences . It is up to human beings , who do have an awareness of these factors , to ensure that these rights are maintained . Beyond this there is the issue of tampering with evolution to change the appearance of animals for our enjoyment . In some countries , cats are declawed and dogs have their tails docked -LRB- cut off -RRB- to make them easier to sell - both cruel and painful processes . This interference with the natural process of evolution is morally wrong and in many cases cruel to the animals in question . 	Keeping pets is a violation of animal rights .
Diseases that can be transferred between animals and humans are called `` zoonoses '' . The list of these diseases is long and varied , and they are often transferred by a subsidiary medium - a parasite like a flea or tick . The risk of contracting these diseases is greatly increased by living in close proximity to the animal carriers , a fact made more significant when we consider the seriousness of some of the diseases . Recent worldwide pandemic alerts have come as a result of zoonosis , so surely it is a sensible idea to remove the threat of disease from within people 's homes . 	As well as the risk to health of the animals , keeping pets can be damaging to human health .
A free market gives the power to the people to choose and decide what products and services should be offered to them . If many people want the same thing the demand will be higher and it will be profitable to offer them on the market since it will sell , therefore the people are in command of what products are being offered to them through their own want . The market is thus decided upon what people need and therefore there will be no excess products or services offered e.g . let us presume that many people want to see high quality basketball , a person like Michael Jordan who has a talent for basketball and has honed his basketball skills would in this case be much in demand . People are ready to pay for the service he offers -LRB- excellent basketball -RRB- and consequently his high wage will be justified . On the other hand a mediocre basketball player would not be paid at all since there is no demand to see mediocre basketball , his service does not have an attraction on the market and will thus be eliminated / . This is all part of what could be called a `` dynamic capitalist system '' which values individuality -LRB- honing your basketball skills -RRB- , rewards ability -LRB- having basketball skills -RRB- and risk-taking -LRB- risking that you will succeed with it -RRB- .

The strongest motivational force a human being can feel towards work is a potential reward for their effort , therefore those who work hard and contribute most to society should justly also gain the most in form of increased wealth -LRB- e.g . private property -RRB- . When work is uncoupled from reward or when an artificial safety net provides a high standard of living for those who do not work , society as a whole suffers . If those who work will benefit equally as the ones who do not there will be no reason to work and the overall productivity will be lowered , which is bad for society . Incentives are therefore necessary since it increases the overall standard for the whole society in form of material wealth , the fact that individuals are driven to succeed and earns what is rightfully theirs is thus in all our interest . With an overall higher productivity even the worst off may benefit more than they would have if the productivity had been low e.g . through charities etc . / / / Rawls , J . -LRB- 1999 -RRB- .

The Western democratic capitalist system protects individual 's rights and liberties through freedom from of interference by other people . Mature adult citizens are believed to have the capacity to choose what kind of life they want to lead and create their own future without paternalistic coercion from the state -LRB- Berlin , 1958 -RRB- . The capitalist society 's ideals could perhaps be best exemplified with the American dream where everyone has an initial equal opportunity to reach their full potential , each individual being choosing their own path free from external coercion , . James Truslow Adams defines the American Dream as the following in 1931 `` life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone , with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement '' . The current President of United Stated Barack Obama is a typical example of a person who has achieved the American dream . Barack Obama did not start his life with a traditional `` fortunate circumstance '' previous presidents had enjoyed -LRB- e.g . George Bush -RRB- . Nevertheless he succeeded in transcending his social class , his race etc . and became the president of United States . Thus capitalism provides everyone with a fair chance to reach great achievements in their life if they seize the opportunities . James Truslow Adams papers , 1918-1949 . -LRB- n.d. -RRB- .

The right to own property is central to man 's existence since it ensures him of his independence of survival . It provides a means to sustain himself without relying on others inasmuch as he has control over a property and can make a living from it . However in order to acquire property the person must gain it from his own labour , if he takes the fruit of someone else 's labour without consent that would be plain stealth . However , this is not the only requirement which must be fulfilled in order to gain property : imagine a scenario where I pour out tomato juice into the ocean , I have mixed my own labour with nature and made an `` own '' creation , but could it be said that the ocean is my property ? Most people would certainly say no and therefore one of the following two provisos must also be met before one can fully acquire property : 1 . It does not impact on others chance of survival / comfort of life 2 . Leaves the others better off than before . Let us presume that we have a wasteland which generates very little harvest since it is uncultivated . If I privatise and cultivate a bit of this land it will generate more harvest since I have put work effort in it . Presuming that the privatisation does not leave the others worse off than before e.g . there is plenty of other wasteland they can cultivate on their own and does thus not harm anyone else 's opportunities/chances to cultivate their own land , privatisation is allowed for the individual good . Alternately , others are better off if they do not have the skill to cultivate land themselves and can lease their labour working on my privatized land , they would win on the deal since the wage I pay them would be better than what they would have gained on their own / .

It is an unavoidable fact that most terrorists today fit into certain demographics and categories , and so it is worth creating profiles of these categories and investigating more thoroughly anyone who fits into these profiles , as they are far more likely to be potential terrorists . As Asra Q. Nomani argued in 2010 : `` As an American Muslim , Ive come to recognize , sadly , that there is one common denominator defining those whove got their eyes trained on U.S. targets : MANY of them are Muslimlike the Somali-born teenager arrested Friday night for a reported plot to detonate a car bomb at a packed Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Portland , Oregon . We have to talk about the taboo topic of profiling because terrorism experts are increasingly recognizing that religious ideology makes terrorist organizations and terrorists more likely to commit heinous crimes against civilians , such as blowing an airliner out of the sky . Certainly , its not an easy or comfortable conversation but its one , I believe , we must have . '' This resolution would not require the targeting of all Muslims , but rather those who meet further profile characteristics . As Dr Shaaz Mahboob , of British Muslims for Secular Democracy , said in 2010 : `` We have seen that certain types of people who fit a certain profile young men of a particular ethnic background have been engaged in terror activities , and targeting this sort of passenger would give people a greater sense of security . Profiling has to be backed by this type of statistical and intelligence-based evidence . There would be no point in stopping Muslim grandmothers . '' Profiles would be compiled and acted on using a range of information , not just details of passengers ethic and racial backgrounds . Information about passengers is already voluntarily provided so this information can be used to eliminate the 60-70 % of passengers who are of negligible risk . . State-of-the art screening technologies could then be applied to the remaining pool of passengers , for which less information is known . As a consequence , these individuals may be subjected to the highest level of security screening , and in some cases , prevented from flying . Philip Baum , editor of Aviation Security International , argues : `` I have been an ardent supporter of passenger profiling for many years . It is the only solution that addresses the problems of the past as well as those of the future . The problem is the word profiling itself , as it conjures up negative connotations . A travelers appearance , behavior , itinerary and passport are factors to consider in effective profiling . Effective profiling is based on the analysis of the appearance and behavior of a passenger and an inspection of the travelers itinerary and passport ; it does not and should not be based on race , religion , nationality or color of skin . We need an intelligent approach to aviation security that deploys common sense to the security checkpoint . We require highly trained , streetwise , individuals who can make risk assessments of passengers as they arrive at the airport and determine which technology should be used for screening . '' Intelligent , well designed and responsive profiling systems study passengers behavior in-situ in addition to their background and appearance . Police officers and security camera operators can be trained to recognize signs of nervous or apprehensive behavior that passengers might exhibit . Brigitte Gabriel , founder and president of ACT ! for America , said in December of 2009 : `` We 're not talking only about profiling Muslims . We need to take a lesson from the Israelis . When you go through security checkpoints in Tel Aviv airport , you have very highly trained screeners . Someone who is about to carry on a terrorist attack acts nervous , acts suspicious -LSB- under such scrutiny -RSB- . '' Profiling would probably have picked up on would-be Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , who notably paid for his ticket in cash , did not have any checked luggage , had booked a one-way ticket to the United States , and claimed he was coming to a religious ceremony . Together , these actions are extremely suspicious and it would have been correct , justified and indeed prudent for airport security to have investigated him on the basis that he met the profile of a possible terrorist . It was only later luck which meant that he was caught instead of succeeding in his attack , all on the basis of the absence of security profiling fully eight years after the 9/11 attacks . Passenger profiling has a record of success in Israel . As Thomas Sowell , senior fellow at the Hoover Institution , argues : `` No country has better airport security than Israel and no country needs it more , since Israel is the most hated target of Islamic extremist terrorists . Yet , somehow , Israeli airport security people do n't have to strip passengers naked electronically or have strangers feeling their private parts . Does anyone seriously believe that we have better airport security than Israel ? Is our security record better than theirs ? ` Security ' may be the excuse being offered for the outrageous things being done to American air travelers , but the heavy-handed arrogance and contempt for ordinary people that is the hallmark of this -LSB- G. W. Bush -RSB- administration in other areas is all too apparent in these new and invasive airport procedures . -LSB- ... -RSB- What do the Israeli airport security people do that American airport security does not do ? They profile . They question some individuals for more than half an hour , open up all their luggage and spread the contents on the counter - and they let others go through with scarcely a word . And it works . Therefore until such security resources are used appropriately , we will never achieve a secure air transportation system , and terrorism and its awful human consequences will remain a constant threat and fear . 	Profiling is effective and necessary :
Profiling is not about demonizing people or violating their rights . As Mark Farmer argues : `` It still amazes me how words can be so quickly demonized , so the very mention of the word causes irrational outrage . Profile doesnt mean baseless discrimination against a certain nationality or race in this case , it means judging people at airports by set of criteria which raise a red flag . '' Profiling , by making security more effective , would in fact better safeguard everyones rights . Khalid Mahmood , a Muslim Labour MP for Birmingham , argues : `` I think most people would rather be profiled than blown up . It would n't be victimisation of an entire community . I think people will understand that it is only through something like profiling that there will be some kind of safety . If people want to fly safely we have to take measures to stop things like the Christmas Day plot . Profiling may have to be the price we have to pay . The fact is the majority of people who have carried out or planned these terror attacks have been Muslims . The state has a duty to protect its citizens by ensuring that its security apparatus is effective and adaptable , even if this means running afoul of political correctness and the rights of those individuals affected . According to Michael Reagan , president of The Reagan Legacy Foundation : `` Political correctness killed innocent people at Fort Hood , an Army base in Texas , when Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan gunned down 13 people and wounded many others despite the fact that his fellow officers were aware of his attachment to radical Islamism and all that it implied . It is the same political correctness that is stopping us today from doing what we truly need to be doing at airports and other public places : profiling all passengers . '' As long as there is a net benefit to everyone of increased security , then individual rights are actually better protected , as everyone who travels has a greater chance of not being blown up . The state should accord a higher priority - when balancing the competing rights claims of citizens - to policies and powers that protect individuals from terrorist attacks than to protecting citizens from the transient feelings of victimisation and isolation that result from profiling . The harm that results from failing to uphold the former is much , much greater than the harm that would attach to the later . Therefore the state should protect the individual rights of its citizens by ensuring that they are protected first by instituting security profiling at airports . 	Profiling is consistent with individual rights :
Expanding the use of profiling will help to restrict the use of invasive security monitoring strategies such as body scanners and intimate , full contact pat-downs . Body-scanning and patting-down all travelers , including older disabled men and women , is an excessive , expensive and humiliating approach to passenger safety . Many civil rights groups in addition to consumers rights organizations and air-travel business analysts feel very strongly that invasive security procedures violates passengers privacy . Profiling those individuals that are a real potential threat is a good way to avoid these problems . As Thomas Sowell argues , proponents of invasive pat-downs and body scanners would rather have scanners look under the clothes of nuns than to detain a Jihadist imam for questioning . '' Alternatives to profiling are far more invasive and likely to be more offensive to Muslims than profiling would be . With broad screening of all travelers for example there is likely to be less security as security resources are directs onto people who are not a threat so offending everybody rather than just a tiny minority . For each search of a passenger who a profiler would regard as highly unlikely to engage in violent activity in plane or an airport , there is a near-negligible impact on security attention and resources . However , when this impact is accumulated over the millions of passengers who fly each year , the effect does indeed become measurable . In essence , by spending billions of dollars on scrutinizing the wrong people , security forces are depleting a reserve of resources that could be spent in screening passengers who are materially more likely to constitute a threat . Broad screening also creates long lines of people awaiting security at airports . Not only does blanket screening reduce the efficiency of airport operations , impacting on the profits of airlines and the businesses that contract with them , security queues themselves could become targets for terrorists , for example through suicide bombings designed to kill an airplanes worth of passengers before they even get through security . By definition , pat-downs and body scanners can not prevent such a threat -LRB- indeed they add to them by creating long lines -RRB- , but profiling can , by picking up on suspicious individuals from the moment they enter the airport , or even from when they book their tickets . Profiling also rightly shifts the security focus from cargo to people . Better knowing who is flying allows security forces to know which cargo -LRB- luggage -RRB- they do need to or do not need to investigate for explosives or drugs , instead of having to search all or do -LRB- ineffective -RRB- random checks . Therefore security profiling is preferable to the alternatives of body scans and invasive pat-downs , both in terms of security efficacy and also in terms of sensitivity to travelers . 	Profiling is preferable to the alternatives :
The vast popularity of MOOCs can be explained by the fact that people are finding it easier to learn this way . The best feature of online learning that it can be done in the privacy of one 's home , which is more convenient than having to move cities or even countries for a university degree . Moreover , online courses are inherently more flexible . Lectures can be watched and tests taken at any time a person desires -LRB- within the deadlines -RRB- , unlike with scheduled lectures and tests at the traditional university . Not only this means a more personal approach to studying , it also provides people with more flexibility to manage their other commitments , such as work and childcare . Such personal and flexible approach to learning will overtake the rigidity of the traditional university . 	Online courses are more convenient for students than traditional university
Online courses can expand access to university education . University education is based on the idea of merit - that the brightest people should be enabled to learn - however in real life many different circumstances play a role in one 's ability to attend university . The result is that lots of stellar people from less-affluent backgrounds do not even apply to the best universities due to costs and anxiety involved in leaving home . In the United States the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution comprise just 14 percent of the undergraduates at top universities -LSB- 10 -RSB- . Online courses allow more bright people to go to a university by definitely removing accommodation and travel costs , and , as some predict , even by lowering or dropping tuition fees -LSB- 11 -RSB- . This argument is made even stronger by inherent flexibility of online courses , which means that people can combine studies with work and family obligations better . This improves access to education for the poor within the country and in particularly for those in less developed countries , which then improves meritocracy of the university system . 	Online courses broadens access to education
Relocating to the best universities is a budgetary concern , but also family and social relations concern for many people , which prevents all the best people from even applying to universities that would suit them the best . Online courses can recruit students from anywhere in the world much easier than traditional universities can because students do n't need to travel far away for the best education . This then ensures that universities have better access to the brightest people . For instance , Stanford University 's online course on Artificial Intelligence enabled people from 190 countries to join , and none of students receiving a score of 100 percent where from Stanford -LSB- 14 -RSB- . Improving the pool of students would automatically result in better academics , professionals and science , which would benefit the society better . 	Online courses are a way to higher academic excellence
Traditional Universities are forced to spend a lot on administration and facilities , such as renting and maintaining buildings and parking lots , providing student support for accommodation , renting student halls , subsiding transports costs and meals , supervising university areas and so on . Across 72 US public universities the average administrative cost was about 8 % of spending with the highest , at the University of Connecticut at 17 % -LSB- 15 -RSB- . All these costs can be cut or abandoned all together if universities move to online teaching . There would be no need for lecture halls and student accommodation as students would just work from home , and even professors could mostly work from home . Even if some of administrative costs remain , that would still substantially increase the amount of resources to be spent entirely on teaching and research . This allows universities to improve their academic credentials and their academic output , which benefits the students and the society . 	Online courses would allow universities to use more resources on teaching and research
One of the technical features of MOOCs is that content of courses can easily be shared between universities and learners -LRB- as content is freely downloadable -RRB- . This is useful in two ways . First , people who are not earning credit from the course can have full access to educational materials , which expands knowledge of those not enrolled in the university . Second , less prestigious universities can benefit by learning how to design courses better , so they can offer better services . MOOCs even offer opportunities for universities to cooperate together to offer shared courses that would decrease duplication and increase quality of education -LSB- 16 -RSB- , which would be of even greater benefit to financially stressed institutions . Shared educational resources would expand access to education even further and drive educational standards higher through university cooperation . 	Online courses encourage sharing of academic information
Normally debt-relief schemes are accused of creating a moral hazard - encouraging governments of poor countries to spend their revenues unwisely in the expectation that creditor nations will wipe out their debts if they get into trouble . Debt relief for countries affected by natural disasters is different , as by their very nature such events are unpredictable and can not be planned for . Instead the possibility of such assistance in the event of an earthquake , tidal wave , or other disaster makes it more possible for developing states to plan ahead and invest wisely for the future . 	Debt relief for nations suffering natural disasters does not cause a moral hazard
Debt relief is much needed for the worlds poorest nations and the only way to ensure that they get back on the road to economic development . Without debt relief , the cycle of poverty , disease and corruption would continue and possibly spread to other parts of the world . Debt relief is particularly needed in countries affected by natural disasters , where much of the aid is focused on solving immediate concerns as opposed to getting the economy back on track . Not only do they desperately need more money to cope with the disaster , but the economic impact of the tragedy reduces their ability to service their loans anyway . What is the point of the developed world promising hundreds of millions of dollars in post-disaster aid , if they then take away much more money each year in debt charges ? A cancelling of debt is a mechanism that dates back to antiquity as a means of resetting power and wealth inequalities that have expanded to critical levels . 	Developing Nations are trapped in a spiral of debt
Debt burdens are common in the developing world , but natural disasters such as earthquakes , tsunamis or hurricanes are rare and unpredictable . Existing debt-reduction programmes take a long-term approach , but years of good policy and improving governance can be totally wrecked by one event . For example Cyclone Nargis in 2008 caused immense damage to Myanmars -LSB- Burma -RSB- economy with disaster costs amounting to nearly 30 % of GDP , something that would immensely strain even the best managed country . 	Disasters wreck attempts at responsible long-term debt management
People who have the misfortune to live in badly-run or totalitarian states still deserve our help when disaster strikes . Debt-relief is one way for the international community to make sure they are not oppressed from without -LRB- by debt charges -RRB- as well as from within . Totalitarian governments may also be more willing to accept aid if it comes with debt relief . 	People who have no power over their government do not deserve to suffer for that governments corruption
A pupil is unable to give or withhold their consent to participating in school prayer . This is because the school environment does not facilitate the free exercise of consent . It mandates attendance , it is delivered in an inherently instructional facility , and its subjects are immature , having underdeveloped faculties of resistance and consent , and being subject to the pressure of their peers . The Supreme Court in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe recognised the significance of social influence upon pupils exerted by colleagues and staff , and that in any school environment , a prayer will be seen as an approved action by the school which is unconstitutional . A pupil does not opt into the practice of prayer - the practice typically takes place in the context of an assembly at which attendance is compulsory . The consent of the pupil to the prayer is therefore not sought but merely presumed . 	Students are unable to give their consent in a school environment .
If regulations were to change and prayers allowed based upon the expressed desires of students and parents , it would be almost impossible to ensure that each individual was receiving what they or their parents would consider the proper exposure to faith or religion . Not only would it be logistically difficult and disruptive to allow students not to attend public prayers , it would also be very difficult to ensure that this was being done . Only by ensuring that it is not allowed can this problem be solved that way those who do want to pray are of course still able to do so and those who do not want to be a part of it or whose parents do n't wish them to be involved may not be forced into doing so . Evidence for this can actually be seen from an attempt to ensure that schools carry out prayer in Wales where it is a legal obligation . The School Standards and Framework Act -LRB- 1998 -RRB- set out that every pupil shall on each school day take part in an act of collective worship . A BBC survey showed in fact that less than half of the schools inspected carried out this obligation - and equally if schools in America were permitted to conduct prayer , the level of continuity and the monitoring of whether or not the rights of the children under the constitution were being breached would be an impossible task . 	It would be almost impossible to ensure that children had a choice in the matter as the status quo requires .
The Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters and Wisconsin v. Yoder recognised that the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing of children under their control extends to the religious faith that is imparted to the children . The proper purpose of schooling is not indoctrination . Should religion be considered a valuable part of a balanced curriculum , it ought to be taught in a broad and critical context in the classroom . A formal prayer instills obedience to a faith that the child might neither understand nor accept and to which the parent or guardian might properly object . The practice does not stimulate discussion or debate and therefore has no place in schools . 	The provision of school prayer fundamentally undermines the proper role of the parents or guardians of the child .
Religious discrimination is completely unacceptable and should certainly not be condoned or even facilitated by a school . Yet , in order to be meaningful , a prayer must also be discriminatory between different religious beliefs . The imprecation of one deity -LRB- as opposed to another or several others -RRB- , the choice of language and the supplication sought are distinctive to each faith . The incorporation of any or all such addresses into a single prayer at best confuses its meaning , and at worst renders it meaningless . Where the practical precatory choice is between discrimination and equivocation no school prayer should be permitted . 	Prayers in public schools are inherently discriminatory against those who are not of the same faith .
European leaders must take a stand on human rights in their own back yard if they are to be taken seriously on the issue anywhere in the world . There are numerous human rights abuses in Ukraine ; migrants `` risk abusive treatment and arbitrary detention '' , Roma and people with dark skin in particular face governmental and societal discrimination and some xenophobic attacks and may be prosecuted for acting in self defense . Amnesty International has highlighted abuse of power by the police numerous cases in Euro 2012 host cities in which police have tortured people in an attempt to extort money , extract a confession , or simply because of the victims sexuality or ethnic origin . If Europe turns a blind eye to these kinds of abuses in neighbouring states without even a minor diplomatic snub it will not have the moral authority to confront worse abuses elsewhere in the world . States that are abusing their own citizens would shrug off criticism believing that European states will not back their criticism up with any action . . 	Boycotting Euro 2012 will highlight Ukraines backsliding on human rights
Viktor Yanukovych fairly came to power in 2010 however since then he has set about attacking the countrys fragile democracy . There are numerous cases showing this democratic decline . For example changes to the constitution that occurred after the Orange revolution have been rolled back to give more power to the presidency . Most visibly opponents of the regime such as Yulia Timoshenko have been jailed in politically motivated trials . At the same time there have been attacks on the freedom of the media and Ukraine has fallen down rankings of press freedom in 2010-11 with its score from freedom house falling from 56 to 59 with its ranking falling to 130 . Ukraine , like its neighbours Russia and Belarus , has become a virtual mafia state where the SBU -LRB- Ukraines successor to the KGB -RRB- is all powerful and the elite are unaccountable . It is becoming more and more corrupt as is shown by its fall down the Corruption Perceptions Index from 118 in 2007 to 152 in 2011 . Ukraine is clearly going in the wrong direction and European leaders need to stand up and show that the will not allow this to continue . , . 	Europe must not give approval to this regime .
Diplomacy is necessary with any regime almost no matter how oppressive they are however that does not show approval of a regime to the world in the way that high profile visits and events can . Just as the Beijing Olympics were the Peoples Republic of Chinas coming out party so Euro 2012 is an ideal chance for Ukraine to show itself off to Europe and the rest of the world . If there was not a boycott this would implicitly show that Europe approves of Ukraine and the actions of its government . In a list of possible diplomatic responses that range from verbal diplomatic complaints right up to sanctions a boycott represents a mid-point . A boycott is perhaps the best action that the European Union leaders could take is it takes away the shine that the event would otherwise give the Yanukovych . It will be denying him the political benefits of the Euros while highlighting rights concerns . A boycott is also proportional because it gives Ukraines leaders a chance to reform before beginning any further measures that would have a much deeper effect on diplomatic relations . 	Boycotting Euro 2012 is proportional
Zambias human resource crisis in healthcare is most prominent in rural areas . Poverty remains widespread and despite Zambias high economic fortune as a result of copper during the 1960s it has become a heavily-indebted poor country . The World Bank -LRB- 2013 -RRB- classifies 76 % of Zambias poor as residing in rural areas . With disparities in access to health prevalent , Zambia needs to train new doctors and nurses to ensure the population can access health care . The VDP is therefore tackling the issue of access within rural , and remote , areas . Access to health is a human right , and the VDP is ensuring such rights are become a reality in rural areas and rural populations . Mortality and morbidity can be reduced as rural health workers are able to diagnose and treat a wider range of conditions . 	Tackling access : working in rural areas
The use of ICT and creating a network of professional experts enables learning and knowledge transfer between health workers and academics . In addition to the brain-drain , whereby skilled health professionals continue to emigrate from Zambia , Zambia also shows a slow rate of training of new health workers . Therefore the VDP provides a vital learning tool . VDP provides practical skills by healthcare workers to learn from first-hand experience while having access to a field of experts , or advisers , able to answer any questions . The quality of healthcare will be improved as workers in remote locations are given access to information and correct answers for diagnosis . A global pool of skills can be drawn upon , and utilised , when required . 	The network approach : promoting learning
Not only does VDP improve access to primary health care but the networks developed between different health advisers mean changing health demands can be met . Across Africa there is now a shift in the type of diseases prevalent . Increasing rates of non-communicable disease are being recorded - for which advisers can provide ongoing support . Additionally , there remains a need to improve understanding and treatment of mental health issues within rural areas in particular . Concern with mental health requires greater recognition across Africa . Finally , data can be collected on health issues affecting rural areas for targeted intervention . 	Taking healthcare beyond basic needs
Even in prosperous economic times , providing jobs and stable growth should be at the forefront of policy maker 's minds . Having more money in the government 's coffers also never hurts considering that keeping a balanced budget is extremely difficult . Turning down an industry that could promote jobs and tax revenue is therefore unwise , particularly when there are ways to make it safe . 2011 has proven to be one of the harshest American job markets since the 1970s . For that reason , cutting jobs and turning away tax revenue needlessly can not be justified . It is estimated that the slow permit process for offshore drilling has cost the Gulf area 230,000 jobs and $ 44 billion including tax revenue . Since the offshore drilling industry creates jobs and tax revenue -- and can be executed without jeopardizing the environmentthen it is a viable option for investment and should be pursued . 	The industry creates jobs and tax revenue .
Obviously , renewable energy sources must be developed and the way Americans consume energy must be addressed , but that is no reason to ignore an effective part of the solution . Considering the amount of oil that the US currently consumes , 19 million barrels a day , it is both unreasonable and nave to believe that the US will quit using oil overnight . Oil will need to be phased out slowly , but until then , the US will continue to consume and demand oil . The cost of oil is placing a serious strain on the US economy and on individual household budgets , and every available strategy should be used to combat the problem 	It is a necessary component of a comprehensive energy strategy .
Offshore drilling will lower gas -LRB- petroleum -RRB- prices . The Energy Information Administration -LRB- EIA -RRB- estimates that offshore drilling could generate 18 billion barrels of crude oil . While it consumes 18,771,400 barrels of oil every day . The US consumes huge amounts of oil , and therefore needs to produce more . Greater availability of domestic oil will result in lower gas prices for American consumers . The ban has prevented the US from taking advantage of this known resource . Considering how oil is used in various aspects of American life and industry , high gas prices contribute to economic health . In 2011 , gas prices are $ 4 a gallon and it is thought that these high gas prices jeopardize the economic recovery . Lowering gas prices is therefore essential to improved economic outlook , and therefore offshore drilling should be considered as a viable option . 	Offshore drilling will lead to lower gas prices and economic health .
Drilling will decrease US dependency on foreign oil and will make America safer . Currently the United States must buy most of its oil from authoritarian and often hostile states such as Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Iran , or from unstable places like Nigeria . 22 % of US oil comes from the Middle East , 22 % from Africa , and 19 % from Latin America . It is estimated that the oil in offshore reserves could supply US energy needs for two years . When problems occur in these unstable energy producing countries , it often causes oil prices to rise , and the US has no way of avoiding these consequences . Oil prices increased when the crisis in Libya ensued . Additionally , the US loses leverage over many international actors as its hands are tied due to dependence on oil , this is the case with nuclear proliferation in Iran for example . Offshore drilling and increased energy independence could help distance America from anti-democratic regimes and the impact of unrest in these unstable nations . 	It will reduce dependence on unstable regions for oil .
Thankfully only 4.4 % of the 60million or so Americans who say they use alternative therapies rely on them exclusively . It is odd that in the cases of anecdotal accounts of the success of alternative medicines this statistic is rarely mentioned . Equally , the impact of other treatment which may have been used by patients eager to credit complementary and alternative medicines with curing their conditions , tend not to get a look in , neither do the relative successes of conventional medicine . This is probably why in every trial alternative medicine has a success rate of between 0 % and 0 % . By contrast there needs only be one instance of harm caused to demonstrate that this motion must stand . Interestingly , although conventional medicine publishes its mistakes in an effort to correct them , nothing similar exists for alternatives . Moreover , there are many accounts of fatalities caused by alternatives both directly and indirectly through delaying accurate diagnosis as seen above -LRB- Oh , the same applies to animals too -RRB- . The food supplements industry alone is worth $ 250 a year worldwide , with little examination of the medical impact of merrily shoving things into your system that were bought at WalMart or Tesco . 	Overwhelmingly alternative therapies are used in conjunction with established remedies - oddly the latter tends not to get the credit for the miracle cure
The National Centre for Conventional and Alternative Medicines has spent over $ 2.5 bn on research since 1992 . The Dutch government funded research between 1996 and 2003 . Alternative therapies have been tested in mainstream medical journals and elsewhere . Not only have thousands of research exercises failed to prove the medical benefit alternative treatments for severe and terminal diseases , serious peer-reviewed studies have routinely disproved them . Its all well and good to pick at mistakes in individual studies . Indeed , this tactic often forms the mainstay of pleas for legitimacy made by members of the alternative medical community . However , the odds against such consistently negative results would be extraordinary . By contrast , conventional medicine only prescribes medicines and treatments that are proven , and vigorously proven , to work . 	Although there are many accounts of the efficacy of alternative cancer treatments , not one has been demonstrated to work in a clinical trial
There are good reasons why new therapies are tested in scientific trials first , rather than just released on the public that it might work . The first is to weed out side-effects but the other is that if you give most people a medicine they will , not unreasonably , expect it to make them better . An entire industry has grown out of alternative medicines . No doubt many alternative practitioners are well meaning , but this does not change the fact that people are making money out of something that , as far as anyone can determine , is basically snake oil . Although many people take both alternative and established treatments , there are a growing number of patients who reject conventional medical wisdom -LRB- -RRB- in cases that prove fatal the availability of alternative medicines raises serious ethical and legal concerns , and also undermines the stringent regimes of monitoring and supervision that qualified medical professionals are subjected to . . 	Many alternative remedies , such as homeopathy , offer nothing but a false hope and can discourage patients from consulting a doctor with what may be serious symptoms
In order to fully understand the implications of this motion , one must see what participating in the FIFA World Cup means to a football player . First of all , it means an intense and sustained physical effort for a significant amount of time . Do not forget that the Cup itself lasts for a couple of weeks , and there are plenty of weeks of training before it in order to get the players in the best shape possible . This means they are exposed to a lot of physical stress and have to play or train no matter of the weather conditions or temperature . Secondly , with temperatures ranging from 35C to 40C during the summer it would be torture to force the players to train and play in those conditions . Former France , Fulham , Manchester United and Everton striker Louis Saha told BBC Sport he thought it was impossible for players to handle the Middle Eastern country 's extremely high summer temperatures . -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` I was in Qatar recently and it was 48C , '' he said . `` Believe me , it is impossible to have a proper game down there . '' It is not only the players who get hurt , but also the game itself , as you can not expect the same show from fatigued , light-headed and exhausted players . Most of all , FIFAs top priority should always be the protection of players health , as , at the end of the day , despite money , show or spectators , no one should risk their life or be obliged to work in unsafe conditions . Studies show the immense risks of heat-related illnesses and their potentially deadly outcome . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Being aware of these issues , FIFAs vice-president Jim Boyce , from Northern Ireland , is prepared to back a decision in principle to move the World Cup to the winter . -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Richard Conway Qatar faces no threat to its right to host 2022 World Cup , 3 October 2013 -LRB- 2 -RRB- Erik Brady Heat-related illness still deadly problem for athletes , , 8/15/2011 	Heat will damage player 's health
One of the most important parts of the game is the fans . They are the ones who watch the sport , they are the ones to which football owes its popularity . Not only are they the ones who pay for the sport they are also a vital part of any competition . Without the choreographies made by the supporters and the impressive cheering , football becomes nothing more than a silent , mediocre sport . As a result , we must take into consideration how well these hundreds of thousands of supporters from all over the world who will come to Qatar feel during the World Cup . Let us not forget , that they will spend most of the time outside the stadia ; on the streets , in the gruelling heat , or they will be forced indoors . Unfortunately , for many of them this experience will be overshadowed by the constant heat-caused discomfort when engaging in the kind of socialising and watching matches at outdoor screens that usually creates the atmosphere of the cup . It is even more worrying when you take into consideration the fact that supporters of all ages and health conditions come here , some of them will be exposing themselves to heat related risks . Heatstroke can potentially cause death . Taking this into consideration , UEFAs 54 member associations have already backed a switch , while Europe 's leading clubs have said they are `` open '' to the possibility of a winter World Cup in Qatar . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The 2022 World Cup in Qatar must switch to winter , according to FIFAs own medical chief . Michel D'Hooghe , the chairman of the FIFAs medical committee , will advise that the risks posed to supporters by extreme heat are too great . `` I am sure the Qataris have the technical skill to organise a tournament where teams could play and train in a stable , acceptable temperature , but it 's about the fans . They will need to travel from venue to venue and I think it 's not a good idea for them to do that in temperatures of 47C or more . '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Richard Conway Qatar faces no threat to its right to host 2022 World Cup , 3 October 2013 -LRB- 2 -RRB- 2022 World Cup in Qatar must be played in winter , 16 September 2013 	A sporting event in the heat of a desert summer will not be a pleasant experience for the fans
There a lot of advantages for you as a country if you are selected to organize a World Cup , a European Cup or any kind of major sport event . They range from fame and international recognition to money and influence in the administrative bodies . Therefore , it is in Qatars interest that this event goes as smoothly as possible in order to prove its organizing capabilities and thus allowing them to increase its chance for hosting any kind of future sporting event . By hosting the event in summer , Qatar is exposing itself a lot of unnecessary risk and probable bad publicity . The most obvious is someone getting injured or even worse , dying during the World Cup . This would be extremely problematic especially if we are talking about a football player participating in the event . It would not only stain Qatars image because it happened during the World Cup organized there , but it would also destroy any credibility that it has as an organiser of events after so many assurances that the heat will not be a problem . Moreover if the cup were to be held in winter , some of the billions that would be used to build such complex systems of air conditioning could be used to serve other purposes . The Qataris could invest it in better publicity , more social campaigns such as discouraging racism in sports or many other areas . In that way , not only they would receive the recognition for being the organizers of the World Cup , but they would get extra credit from the international community for being involved in the social benefits of sports for example . In conclusion , the Qataris do have the administrative support for a change of schedule , as even Sepp Blatter , FIFAs President has recognised After many discussions , deliberations and critical review of the entire matter , I came to the conclusion that playing the World Cup in the heat of Qatar 's summer was simply not a responsible thing to do and they should take advantage of this situation . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Owen Gibson World Cup 2022 : Sepp Blatter paves way for winter tournament in Qatar , 3 October 2013 	Moving to the winter would benefit Qatar
The United States has become economically dependent upon the productive capacities of other states , leaving it vulnerable to their influence and machinations . Its reliance upon China to produce much of its consumer goods and upon the Middle East for oil , have resulted in a major trade imbalance that is only growing . The trade deficit was $ 50.2 billion in May 2011 with China alone making up $ 25 billion of this . Eventually China , and , other net exporters to the United States will be able to pull its economic strings , and thus dominate it politically . For the United States to retain its political and economic autonomy , it must rein in its overactive spending as well as its borrowing from abroad . The only way to accomplish this is through a policy promoting domestic self-sufficiency by means of raising trade barriers with states and firms abroad . Through a regime of protective tariffs and forced trade balancing , the United States can expand domestic industries and rebuild those that have atrophied due to foreign competition . It is through such policies that it can restore itself to the position of a net exporter and escape the economic invasion of foreign powers . The result of an isolationist policy for the economy will be a more self-sufficient nation with domestic industries capable of providing for the needs of its citizens , and one not dependent on any other state for vital commodities . The United States is particularly well suited to such an enterprise due to its immense size and wealth in resources and human capital . There is no need for such damaging economic relations as it has pursued , as allowing itself to be tied into the international economic system only exposes it to the machinations of unfriendly foreign powers and also makes it susceptible to contagion effects of economic crises in international markets . Clearly , the wise path is for America to protect its own economic interests through protectionism and isolationism . 	Pursuing an isolationist foreign policy will increase the United States ' economic security .
Popular opinion in the United States has been shifting more and more toward preference for non-interventionist and isolationist foreign policy . People in the United States are tired of the costs of foreign adventures , in both lives and wealth , and have been clamoring as of late for a return to a more traditional foreign policy . This is amply demonstrated in the rise of the Tea Party movement and its success in the 2010 congressional election . The Tea Party has been fighting for a less intrusive , smaller government , and demand that state spending be reined in and the massive deficit dealt with . There is no better way to accomplish this aim than reducing American involvement in foreign conflicts and in its large military presence around the world . By pursuing a policy of non-interventionism , the United States will be able to bring its finances back in order by not spending so heavily on defense , while also allowing domestic production to increase through protectionism of domestic business . Liptak , Adam . 2010 . `` Tea-ing Up the Constitution '' . New York Times . Available : 	Current popular sentiment in the United States supports a move toward greater isolationism .
The United States has at its disposal the most powerful military in history , and is comparatively more powerful than any single state has been in history . Yet its forces are stretched thin across the globe and embroiled in ongoing conflicts in several regions , particularly its seemingly endless wars in the Middle East . The cost of such military output and the number of soldiers stationed on over 800 military bases around the world is unsustainable . The United States must focus its defense policy on the protection of its own borders and its own people rather than getting involved with the problems of other states as it has done in recent years . Behaving as the world 's police has served to provide many countries with the public good of international security , allowing them to scale back their own military spending and letting the United States pick up the slack . Yet its behavior has not earned it approbation , but rather the ire of many parts of the international community , as well as that of terrorist groups who see the United States as an imperialist oppressor . The growing economic cost of this international security provision , along with the domestic security threats created by it create the risk that the United States could collapse under the pressure , as so many powerful states have done in the past ; just as Rome fell due to its stretching its resources too thin , so too might the United States . By pursuing a policy of isolationism , the United States can spend less while providing superior security for its own citizens . Its technological and military superiority will not be affected by such a move , but will rather simply be more efficiently utilized . With a military dedicated to the protection of the United States and its narrow national interests , it can project power around the world without the huge costs of the current system . Kennedy , Paul . 1987 . The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers . New York : Random House . 	The United States is currently suffering from the effects of imperial overstretch .
The United States has spent the last several decades trying to promote its ideals around the world by , among other things , offering support to fledgling democracies and democratic movements , staging humanitarian interventions to end tyranny and oppression , and offering extensive foreign aid packages to weaker economies struggling to develop . All of these activities have put the United States into a state of almost constant conflict . Its interventions in Korea , Vietnam , Kosovo , Iraq , Afghanistan , and others have proven costly in both blood and treasure . For all its efforts , the United States has gained little in terms of material benefits for its own people . Yet the first duty of a state is to its own people . By adopting a position of isolationism , the United States can place its focus on protecting its own people . Instead of getting caught up in entangling alliances that lead to unnecessary foreign wars , the United States can follow a path of peace and self-sufficiency that will allow its people to be free of the costs and horrors of war and international intrigue . On the level of principle , it is the duty of the United States government to be isolationist , because only in that way can it fulfill its true duty which is to maintaining the safety of its people . Nordlinger , Eric . 1995 . Isolationism Reconfigured : American Foreign Policy For a New Century . Princeton : Princeton University Press . 	The United States should accept that international relations in amoral , and that its focus should be on protecting its own interests , not on moralizing and protecting the rest of the world .
The foreign policy of the United States was first conceived as being one of strict isolationism . Since the time of George Washington , who warned against the risks of entangling alliances with foreign powers , American foreign policy has been based squarely in the principles of non-interventionism . By pursuing this course the United States was able to avoid involvement in the ruinous wars of Europe that wracked that continent during the 18th and 19th centuries , sapping their strength and ultimately bringing about the downfalls of their far-flung empires . During those same years the United States was able to focus on its own growth , fighting only when its own vital interests were at stake , and pushed its borders from being just a small nation on the Eastern coast of the North American continent to the point whereby it was a continent-spanning giant . It was only during World War One that the United States broke with its long tradition of non-entanglement with foreign powers , and its involvement in that conflict led it to be embroiled in the foreign intrigues and power games that made the 20th and early 21st centuries ones of almost constant American involvement in wars ; wars that were always in far-flung locales in which the United States ' vital interests did not truly lie . In order to escape the entanglements of the international system , the United States must seek to disengage itself and to pursue once again a policy of concern for its own interests without concern for the happenings of other states .

The EU is one of the worlds largest trade blocs , has the worlds largest GDP , and represents almost half a billion people.A permanent seat for the EU would reflect those new power dimensions . The permanent seats for France and the UK are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of World War II . However , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : France and the UK have declined and at the same time , the EU has emerged as a major player in the international arena . 	The EU is one of the world 's largest trade blocs , has the world 's largest GDP , and represents almost half a billion people .
There is a growing imbalance between developing and developed countries representation in the Council . Four out of five permanent members are industrialized and four out of five are European . The four-fifths of humankind that live in developing countries have only one spokesman among the permanent five . Giving Africa , Asia and Latin America a permanent seat is a step forward in North-South balance Currently , four out of five veto-bearing members are industrialized countries and the fifth , China , is rapidly approaching industrialized status . Many in the rest of the world seethe at their exclusion from this elite group . Africa , Latin America , and the Islamic world , for example , have no permanent voice on the council . Without a voice , it is understandable why many countries are unwilling to send troops or aid whenever the Security Council demands it . This imbalance , highlighted by the Iraq war , has made Security Council reform a hot topic of debate . -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- -RRB- Teng , Michael . ` United Nations Security Council Reform Autumn 2003 ' 	There is a growing imbalance between developing and developed countries representation in the Council .
At the moment many countries are not heard in the council and some states may never gain a chance of being elected to the Security Council . This leaves billions of the world 's population without representation in the world 's highest body . How can India with over a sixth of the world 's population be left out ? Security Council expansion would make the UN much more democratic as there would be more participants representing more of the people of the world present in closed meetings and informal consultations . Expansion would increase the transparency and therefore the accountability of the Council something that even countries sometimes considered to be against democracy believe is necessary he -LRB- Seyed Mohammad Ali Mottaghi Nejad -RRB- said Iran believed that the links between the issues comprised the basic objective of a comprehensive reform towards a Council that was more democratic , inclusive , equitably representative , transparent , effective and accountable . -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- ` Concluding Annual Debate on Security Council Reform , General Assembly ' , 12/11/2010 , 	The Security council needs to be more democratic .
In 1945 there were only 51 UN members , so eleven Council members were adequately representing all voices . Today the UN membership has risen to almost four times the number of the original one , yet there are only fifteen voices in the Council . This means that there are many countries who do not have anyone on the security council that has similar priorities to them , their views may well be unrepresented . 	A rise in UN membership should be reflected also in an increase in Security Council members .
The current Security Council doesnt reflect the economic reality of the 21st century . France and Great Britain have clearly lost their position among the most powerful nations and their role was long ago taken over by Germany and Japan . They are the 3 and 4 world economies . Furthermore these two countries are the second and third largest contributors to the UN budget and deserve a permanent seat in the Council . Moreover , as permanent members pay an extra share for their seat , Japan and Germanys contributions would bring considerable amounts to the UN budget The three largest contributors to the United Nations , the US -LRB- 22.000 % of the UN budget -RRB- , Japan -LRB- 12.530 % -RRB- and Germany -LRB- 8.018 % -RRB- thus together finance some 43 % of the entire UN budget . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Meanwhile Brazil and India have emerged as major economies and stable democracies over the past decade , and deserve recognition for their global importance . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Contributions to the United Nations budget 	The current Security Council does n't reflect the economic reality of the 21st century .
What are international labour and business standards ? They are globally acceptable methods of doing business and employing labour . These include Conventions Against Forced Labour , Discrimination and Child Labour . These also form guideline structures for social policy such as labour dispute resolution bodies , employment services and good industrial relations . Therefore , this goes hand in hand with reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of the employees , and hence the standard is a facet of development in itself . This helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending . Employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically . The poorest countries invariably have the lowest standards of labour and business . It is essential to raise these standards to an international level , implementing standards against practices like child labour . If this is done then the purpose of development aid , which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people , will improve . In an absence of such a pre-requisite , a developing country will be free to employ standards that do not reflect the same principles of the donor nation . Thus , to avoid a hypocritical scenario , this pre-requisite is necessary . C029 - Forced Labour Convention , Adoption : Geneva , 14th ILC session , 28 June 1930 , International Labour Office , Discrimination -LRB- Employment and Occupation -RRB- Convention , 1958 No . 111 , ILO Conventions and Recommendations on child labour , , How International Labour Standards are used , , 	International labour and business standards go hand in hand with development standards and will de facto increase implementation levels
Increasing the required standard of business and labour will result in increases to the current standard labour and business standards even before aid is entirely tied as countries implement changes to ensure they get the most possible aid . Simply setting an expected level of labour and business standards will therefore create improvement in those standards . In the case of the Decent Work Country Programme for Bangladesh 2006-2009 Bangladesh has been implementing the program due to its positive benefit towards achieving the millennium development goals . This is despite challenges such as the lack of employment opportunities in the country . The programme has been successful in improving social protection , working conditions and rights for female , male , and children workers in a few sectors and areas . International Labour Organization , Bangladesh : Decent Work Country Programme 2012-2015 , 2012 	Increasing a standard , even if not as high as the donor would want , increases the standard of the present situation
Labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid . In 1998 the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions . The business and labour regulations protect the basic worker rights and improve job security through demanding the elimination of discrimination and empower workers through the recognition of freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining like in those in developed western countries . This then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up . It would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid . It should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically for example a 40 hour working week is more productive per hour than a 60 hour week . the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work , About the Declaration , , ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up , Adopted by the International Labour Conference at its Eighty-sixth Session , Geneva , 18 June 1998 -LRB- Annex revised 15 June 2010 -RRB- , Robinson , Sara , Bring back the 40-hour work week , , 14 March 2012 , 	Labour standards are necessary to protect basic human rights
When a donor nation parts with foreign aid for development to a nation , it must always choose who it prefers to give it to as there is a limited pot of money to donate there needs to be a way of allocating it . It is not surprising therefore that countries with shared colonial histories tend to dominate aid flows , thus Britain has historically given most aid to countries that were its colonies ; in 1960 Malta and Cyprus received most , while India was the biggest recipient for much of the rest of the 20 Century . Further , often countries offering aid , such as the US , the UK , and the EU , require the pre-requisite of democracy or the start of a democratisation process . Therefore , it is justified to add a pre-requisite for better standards of business and labour as it helps implementation , and principally meets the goals of the developmental aid itself .

As long as developing nations constantly keep employing poor labour standards , it will keep putting a strain on the global economy . This is because other countries will be pressured to do the same just to remain competitive . This creates a race to the bottom effect and would create poor conditions and loss of freedom in the global South , and causes workers in the global North to lose their jobs to cheap outsourced labour . Higher labour standards in developing countries therefore also benefits developed countries . However the converse is also true ; labels like fair trade provide a guarantee of ethical quality and show that consumers are willing to pay more to ensure good labour standards . Changing Global Trade Rules , , 	When developing countries employ poor labour standards , other countries follow the example in order to be competitive
In offering amnesty Western governments make an exceptionally powerful public statement in the international arena , an area in which they already hold great sway as norm-setters . It is a statement that shows that they will not simply ignore the abuses of power used by repressive regimes to stifle dissent and the voices of reform . Ultimately , the power of oppressors to act with impunity is the product of democracies unwillingness to challenge them . Authoritarian regimes often claim to value freedom of the press , for example article 35 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of China guarantees it , and this policy challenges them to make their practice more like what they preach . A policy of amnesty for those threatened with the lash of tyranny serves to actively protect those people while at the same time upholding the avowed principles of justice and fairness the West proclaims . This will show that the West does not play favourites or turn a blind eye to these repressions , but is an active player , willing to step in to shield those who share its dreams of a freer world . The international ridicule these policies can generate will serve to shame regimes into relaxing their policies and to embrace at least a road to reform . Nor should it be assumed that this rhetoric will have no real consequences , many authoritarian regimes encourage investment by companies from democratic countries , such investment is less likely when that companys home state is publically condemning that state by granting amnesties to dissident bloggers .

The internet has become the paramount means of voicing dissent within repressive regimes . As the technology regimes have to keep control of their people increases , with access to high-tech surveillance technology adding to their already formidable arsenals of physical oppression , the internet has become the only platform to express meaningful dissent . The Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia , for example , wherein people mobilized to overthrow their dictator has even been dubbed the Twitter Revolution . Bloggers have become a major voice of dissent in other repressive regimes , including Cuba and China . Yet the blog platform is far from safe . Governments have sought to crack down on bloggers ability to dissent , using draconian methods like imprisonment to cow them into silence . In China the arrests of bloggers like Zhai Xiaobing , who was arrested and detained for simply posting a joke about Communist Party , have served to frighten many into silence . So long as information is denied to the public , governments are able to maintain their repression . Only external help from democratic , or at least more liberal , states can provide the safe haven for people who have rubbed their governments the wrong way in their pursuit of reform and justice .

The universality of human rights , of the freedom of speech and of due process is all touted as crucial by the worlds democracies . Democratic countries are frequently vocal on the subject of liberty , on the superiority of their system of government that provides for the best protection of human dignity . By offering amnesty to bloggers , the people standing at the forefront of the democratic cause in oppressive regimes , Western countries take a largely low-cost action that provides for the security and safety of some the bravest people in the public arena . The West must stop kowtowing to oppression and make a stand to offer an umbrella of protection to those who need it . That protection is absolutely crucial to the development of more dissent in the blogosphere and on the ground . Only by nurturing dissent can it ever take root and overcome the vast powers of authoritarian government . The promise of protection is hugely powerful because it gives bloggers a safety net to fall back on . Those already active will feel more empowered to speak out against their oppressors , and some currently cowed by fear will have the courage to speak up . The guarantee of amnesty also removes the perceived randomness of such offerings that currently occur , as in the recent case of Cuba in which two bloggers of similar pedigree asked for asylum in the US , but only one received it . Such inconsistency has bred fear in the minds of dissidents . This policy would correct for it and help bolster the cause of justice on all fronts . It is through offering amnesty that democracies can provide the catalyst for the change they avow to be the paramount aim of human civilization . Fox News Latino .

The internet can be used as a tool to create an imminent threat to the public . If public officials had information that a massive protest is being organized , which could spiral into violence and endanger the safety of the public , it would be irresponsible for the government not to try to prevent such a protest . Governments are entrusted with protecting public safety and security , and not preventing such a treat would constitute a failure in the performance of their duties . An example of this happening was the use first of Facebook and twitter and then of Blackberry messenger to organise and share information on the riots in London in the summer of 2011 .

The death of the book has been predicted with virtually every technological innovation and yet , it remains one of the most widespread and recognised means of communication in the world , with physical book sales representing about 80 % of total book sales . There are many reasons for this , its communicability , its physicality , it history and associations . Whatever the reasons for its enduring success , it remains one of the great design achievements of humanity as a species , comfortably alongside the wheel , the screw and cash . Whatever the reason for this enduring success , it has it and the latest set of doomsayers may well go the way of the rest . Perhaps the greatest reason for its enduring success is that the book is silent . The reader gives voice to characters and charts their own way through fiction or selects their own phrases for emphasis in non-fiction . There is nobody actor or director between the reader and the author . If that applies to the printed word it applies equally or more to Braille . It is notable that the decline in braille literacy has led to a decline in poetry and literature output by the blind community . In turn , it is surely part of the authors right to speak freely that they speak directly to their reader .

We know from the work of educational psychologists that different people acquire knowledge in different ways . For example , some sighted language learners learn more effectively visually , other aurally . The evidence mentioned in the introduction suggests that this is no less true for blind students with those without access to Braille scoring less well in exams than those with it . This becomes an issue of free speech when by compelling people to acquire information in a certain way means that they either have less access to that information or less chance of effectively digesting it . For those for whom are proficient Braille is their preferred medium , despite there being alternatives for communication , it is their only medium for text , and is useful for using computers which may use a braille display . However , even if this were just a matter of preference , it would be odd not to treat this as a free speech issue ; allowing people access to information in a way that is not only possible but comfortable and convenient is at the heart of most forms of information distribution . A majority of people receive their news online but newspapers still exist because some people prefer them . It would be possible for readers to access information via microfiche but would be so inconvenient that it is rarely used . It surely makes sense to see new delivery systems for information as an opportunity to expand , not reduce , the methods available for both imparting and receiving information .

The issue of the protection of minority languages is a difficult one for most governments as it is usually argued that most speakers of such languages also make use of the dominant language and , where they dont , they should learn for their own good . For example French speakers in Canada must also learn English . However , there are senses and experiences that are uniquely held within a community and expressed within those languages . In many ways Braille functions in similar ways , a shared experience between those who read it , a bond between users and , for the most part , denied to outsiders . By its nature , it is tactile and speaks in a way that is not true of audiobooks prepared for a wider market . In purely practical terms there is relatively little difference between reading speeds in Braille and listening to audiobooks -LRB- about 130 against 150 wpm -RRB- . Learning Braille also has immense practical benefits , not least of which is being employable , 90 % of those who are braille literate are employed compared to 33 % of blind people who are braille illiterate . It seems simply strange to insist that those who have already lost one form of access to the wider world indeed the method most widely used in that world should be denied another simply because it is deemed to be cheaper , easier or better for them . Indeed such an action is deeply redolent of the debate over minority languages . Although not all of the blind community prefers to use Braille , many of them do and that would seem sufficient reason to respect it as an important way in which they interact with the world , and receive and impart ideas the twin pillars of free speech .

The American Jobs Act helps small businesses and is also set to significantly increase the number of jobs available to people . Small enterprise is particularly important in the creation of jobs because these businesses tend to be start-up businesses . Many start-ups are entrepreneurial in character , and succeed or fail on their ability to identify and exploit new markets . Increasing investment in new and emergency markets spurs the creation of additional jobs within those markets . Thanks to the cuts in payroll tax contained in the Jobs Act , many small businesses will stand to benefit by gaining some of the money paid to the government back . The Presidents plan will also eliminate payroll taxes entirely if firms add new workers or increase the wages of their current workers . As such , there will be significant incentives for small businesses to hire more workers . Cuts to payroll taxes , combined with the other changes planned by the bill , are estimated to create 100,000 jobs a month for the next year , accompanied by a projected 1.25 % increase in GDP . Moodys Analytics is even more optimistic about the likely benefits to the American economy should the act pass , predicting growth rates at 2 % and claiming that 1.9 million jobs will be created as a result .

The long term unemployed in America are important to the economic recovery . Whilst those who are temporarily unemployed will eventually come back into employment and start contributing to the economy , they will often be offset by those losing work . For the U.S. economy to gain headway , spare capacity must be created in the economy for those who have not been employed for a long period of time . Should the U.S. be able to harness these workers and create extra employment capacity to keep them in employment , then the U.S. economy will see a boost as the number of people gaining work will outnumber those losing work to a more significant level than seen ordinarily in an economic recovery . The American Jobs Act helps in this area by creating what is known as a Bridge to Work program which capitalises on initiatives that many states have put into place in order to deal with long term unemployment . Specifically these programmes help those without jobs take temporary or voluntary work whilst they also pursue on the job training in order to make them more employable in the long run . There is also a $ 4000 tax credit for employers that hire long-term unemployed workers . Further , prohibitions on discrimination based on length of unemployment will also come into place . As such the American Jobs Act is likely to stimulate the economy through the creation of a bigger and better trained work force . 	The American Jobs Act Will Help the Long Term Unemployed
One of the more divisive problems in America is the increasing inequality between the wealthy and members of other classes . The harms that could , and have resulted from this extend to the Occupy Protests in the tail end of 2011 , as well as riots With the rich consistently seeming to get richer despite the poor economic climate , many of the less rich within the American economy feel that the state is playing against them , conferring advantages on those best able to lobby politicians and make large election campaign donations . This is problematic when it is state mechanisms that will enable Americans who lack access to costly universities to better educate and train themselves , thus making them more employable thus allowing them to help push the American economy out of recession . A popular consensus has emerged amongst Americas middle class , which portrays the recession as an event triggered by the rich , with rhetoric regarding Greedy Bankers playing into the public discourse on the ineffectiveness of state regulation of large financial institutions . The American Jobs Act redresses the balance between the wealthy top tier of American society and its middle and working classes . In doing so , it helps to alter the perception of the rich and their contributions to society . The burdens currently confronted by Americas middle class are addressed in a number of ways . Firstly , payroll tax , a pay-as-you-earn tax that is withheld from employees wages , will be significantly reduced . As such , any families with a large number of working members will be subjected to a much lower tax burden . This would provide a tax cut of around $ 1,500 to a typical American family . Given also the higher tax burden placed on the rich with this tax , and the system that results is likely to be skewed more strongly in favour of working Americans . Further , changes in the taxation system will also be able to sure up any loopholes that have been exploited by the rich to avoid taxes . Finally , the jobs act redresses problems where the largest subsidies go to things such as charitable giving and mortgage interest presumably things which are paid by people who need subsidies the least . Caps will be placed on such tax breaks under the act and as such , money will be more likely to go to people who need it more the poor or unemployed . In bringing about these changes , better economic circumstances are created for the poor and the balance between rich and poor is likely to become smaller .

The only function of a gun is to kill . The more instruments of death and injury can be removed from our society , the safer it will be . In the U.S.A. death by gunshot has become the leading cause of death among some social groups ; in particular for African-American males aged from 12 to 19 years old . Quite simply , guns are lethal and the fewer people have them the better . 	The only function of a gun is to kill
There is a correlation between the laxity of a countrys gun laws and its suicide rate not because gun owners are more depressive , but because the means of quick and effective suicide is easily to hand . As many unsuccessful suicides are later glad that they failed in their attempt , the state should discourage and restrict the ownership of something that wastes so many human lives . 	Gun ownership increases the risk of suicide
The legal ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens inevitably leads to many unnecessary and tragic deaths . Legally held guns are stolen and end up in the hands of criminals , who would have greater difficulty in obtaining such weapons if firearms were less prevalent in society . Guns also end up in the hands of children , leading to tragic accidents and terrible disasters such as the Columbine High School massacre in the U.S.A . Sometimes even normal-seeming registered gun owners appear to go mad and kill , as tragically happened at Hungerford and Dunblaine in the U.K . 	The legal ownership of guns by ordinary citizens inevitably leads to many accidental deaths
Shooting as a sport desensitises people to the lethal nature of all firearms , creating a gun culture that glamorises and legitimises unnecessary gun ownership . It remains the interest of a minority , who should not be allowed to block the interests of society as a whole in gun control . Compensation can be given to individual gun owners , gun clubs and the retail firearms trade , in recognition of their economic loss if a ban is implemented .
