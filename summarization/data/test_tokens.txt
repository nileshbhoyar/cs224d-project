Transforming entire sectors of the economy and the resulting shifts in patterns of migration , training , employment and resourcing will be both complex and complicated and require a massive logistical effort . Waiting until the worlds grain baskets are already dustbowls or Manhattan is underwater is simply unrealistic . Instead , nations individually and collectively need to plan and begin to implement the necessary changes now . Even the process of achieving political agreement on some of the likely changes could take decades . 2050 has been widely seen as the date when the ravages of Climate Change will be all too obvious ; 30 years is no time at all in diplomatic and industrial terms . The financial costs of inaction on Climate Change have been estimated at $ 74tn , however that pails into insignificance with the broader human costs . Against that the World Bank has estimated that the costs of adaptation at a wildly varying but still relatively modest $ 4bn - $ 109bn a year . 	The shifts required will take decades to plan and implement , they are already urgent
There are significant research challenges that need to be addressed in terms of envisaging what an adaptation regime would look like . For example how adaptation would tie into to other types of change social , economic , demographic , etc . . Answering these questions , alone , will take time but are a necessary precursor to building a realistic adaptation routine . The urgency here comes from the fact that it will take time to establish new systems to work on this at an international level . One of the difficulties demonstrated by the experience of initial studies of climate change was that it needed to be conducted on a global scale , frequently involving complex and expensive modeling systems . There are several backstages to establishing this and the majority of relevant academics are currently working on prevention models rather than designing an entire new framework of prediction . Developing such frameworks will require the focus of governments , in terms of research funding policies and agreeing enforcement and delivery models . Given the choice between building a framework that can work and focussing on one that hasnt , the choice seems to be fairly obvious . See also the UN site 	The necessary research alone will take time and should be a priority
Improvements to existing rail networks would ultimately fail to be viable as a replacement for highspeed rail . As British Transport Secretary -LRB- now reshuffled -RRB- Phillip Hammond states , `` Opponents of the project have asked why we can not simply upgrade our existing infrastructure to deal with this capacity challenge . But no upgrade of existing infrastructure can deliver the huge improvements in journey times and the transformation of our economic geography that a new high speed network would bring . Reliability would also deteriorate as we tried to squeeze ever more capacity out of existing , mixed-use lines . And another major upgrade to the West Coast Main Line would deliver years of disruption and huge economic cost . '' Upgrading infrastructure may be an answer in some places , but not in all . There may not be the existing infrastructure to upgrade . The United States for example just does not have lines that could take both large numbers of passengers and the large amount of freight they already take . Moreover any upgrade of these existing lines would end up with a rail system which is uncompetitive with road and air transport , exactly why rail passenger transport ended in the 1930-50s in the United States despite having been running faster than Amtrak trains do today . Further , railroad tracks permit a far higher throughput of passengers per hour than a road the same width . A high speed rail needs just a double track railway , with one track for each direction . For the Eurostar the typical capacity is 15 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train -LRB- as for the Eurostar sets -RRB- , which implies a capacity of 12,000 passengers per hour in each direction . By contrast , the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity for a single lane of highway of 2,250 passenger cars per hour -LRB- excluding trucks or RVs -RRB- . Assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people , a standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13 % greater than a 6-lane highway -LRB- 3 lanes each way -RRB- , while requiring only 40 % of the land -LRB- 1.0 / 3.0 versus 2.5 / 7.5 hectares per kilometer of direct/indirect land consumption -RRB- . This means that typical passenger rail carries 2.83 times as many passengers per hour per meter -LRB- width -RRB- as a road . 	Highspeed Rail is Better than Upgrading Old Infrastructure
Trains are the most sustainable and green form of transportation . Electric high speed rail is the most energy efficient of all trains . This is because trains have significantly high capacity but have very low power requirements in order to work by comparison to the number of passengers that they carry . Although this is to some extent dependant on how the power is generated the Eurostar -LRB- where power comes from French nuclear plants -RRB- emits only 11g GO2 per passenger kilometre from London to Paris compared to 180g for a car containing 1.2 passengers and 150g for a short haul flight . A national high speed rail system would be the centrepiece of a sustainable America , and would significantly reduce congestion and Americas dependence on cars and the oil that fuels them . This would result in large cuts to carbon emissions . Any new system could be powered by renewable energy including wind , solar , geothermal , and ocean/tidal in order to make it even cleaner . High speed rail could be integrated in to a sustainable network including local commuter rail and tramways so providing public transport networks that solve serious mobility , energy , environmental , economic , health , and social problems simultaneously . 	High Speed Rail is environmentally friendly
Currently intercity travel within the U.S. tends to favour air travel . This is often due to the large distances between cities within the U.S. which mean that driving is not a viable strategy should there be time constraints on travel . However , air travel has significant constraints as well such as long boarding times . This causes problems for those people who frequently commute and high speed rail is set to solve these problems . High speed rail provides a large number of significant benefits over air travel in this regard . This is because high speed rail can travel to city centres . Where airports , due to their size and the noise pollution they cause , are limited to the outskirts of a city , trains are not limited in the same way . As such , people can arrive in a much more central area , cutting large amounts of time off their journey . Secondly , high speed rail has no limits on wireless communication or internet in the same way that air travel does . As such , high speed rail is significantly more useful for anyone who wishes to work on the journey . Finally , the weather is incredibly problematic for air travel . This is especially true in the U.S. where a number of areas can be subject to unexpected snow or storms . By comparison , High Speed rail remains comparatively unhindered . 	High Speed Rail is Better Than Air Travel
Doing so increases the economic potential of the future workforce , and so will bring increased tax revenues in the long term to more than cover any initial costs . Although some countries would experience a more dramatic change than others , it is worth noting that in many states a very large majority of young people voluntarily stay in education beyond the end of compulsory schooling -LRB- e.g . France , Germany and Japan -RRB- . In the UK 84 per cent of pupils in year 10 stated that they had intentions to stay on in further education . If these countries can already bear the extra cost without economic collapse , it should be possible for others to cope as well . 	Raising the school-leaving age is a crucial investment in society 's future
More education provides the opportunity to acquire more skills and therefore more options . It has been shown many times that those with more education find it easier to find work and that they are more likely to find that work satisfying . Similarly , the level of education among the population can have a positive effect on the economy as a whole as they can be more efficient workers . The impact of extra years of education on earnings and economic productivity is also disproportionately heavy at the lower end - that is , two more years at school for a 16 year old will make a much greater percentage difference to their later economic worth than two years of graduate work for a 22 year old . The UK has recently raised the school leaving age to 18 for the same reasons . 	More education brings more opportunities
Ensuring everyone gets educated for the same amount of time at school should promote equality . Currently early-school leaving is linked with other indicators of socio-economic disadvantage , such as low-income jobs or high unemployment . More importantly parents who left school young and as a consequence have lower-grade occupations are more likely to have children who leave school early -LRB- only 60 % of those children stay in education past 16 -RRB- . Forcing all children to stay in school longer could break this cycle of disadvantage . 	Raising the school learning age promotes equal opportunities
All people have the right to determine their own form of government and representation and Quebec has been systematically denied this right . Quebec has historically been denied the right to determine its own form of governance systematically and therefore the Canadian government has no right to claim legitimacy over Quebec and can not stop it from leaving the federation . The Canadian Constitution was patriated in 1982 in a backroom deal known as the Meech Lake Accord where Quebec was explicitly excluded from the negotiations and their issues were ignored . Specifically , Quebec was attempting to entrench recognition of their special status and needs as a distant society within Canada and this was denied . To this day , Quebec has refused to sign the Canadian constitution as it feels it doesnt adequately represent its interests and needs . Therefore , Quebec has the right to independence as its sovereignty was illegitimately taken from it and it is systematically denied adequate representation in Canadian politics . `` The Meech Lake Accord .

International law recognizes Quebecs right to self-determination and denying them self-determination is therefore a violation of international law . International law recognizes the right of all peoples to self-determination . The international community has decided that it is oppressive to individuals to live under a government that is systematically incapable or unwilling to protect them and their interests . The Quebecois have been systematically denied adequate representation in the federal government of Canada . Quebecois legislation protection their basic rights to retain their language and culture have been met with contempt and legal action by the federal Canadian government and courts . This is but one example of the very clear denial of basic representation and self-governance that afflicts the Quebecois in Canada . Therefore , Quebec has the legal right to self-determination and independence in international law .

The only way to ensure that Quebecers get to retain their distinct culture is to gain independence as a country and remove themselves from the Canadian federation . A very big issue for certain Quebecers is the threat that an overwhelmingly English-speaking country has on their pocket of distinct French-Quebecois culture . The unrestricted immigration of English-speaking Canadians to Quebec has diluted the culture of the Quebecois and has set off the process of cultural-loss and the highly feared loss of their language . Moreover , whenever Quebec has tried to put in place provisions to protect their culture and language , such as with Bill 101 , Quebec is called racist and Canadian Federal Courts try to strike down their laws to stop their discrimination against English-speaking Canadians in their province . The only way that Quebec can protect its language and culture is to be able to stop the unrestricted flow of English-speaking immigration into its territory and gain complete control over its own law and cultural policy . The only way to do this is to gain independence from Canada . `` Only Quebec independence can protect French language : PQ strategist . '' 26 Nov 2007 , n. pag .

The installation costs of an entire wind farm are , admittedly , fairly high although they pale into insignificance compared to an oil station or a nuclear plant but after that there is almost no associated cost whatsoever . In addition to which farms can be built incrementally ; a half completed wind farm is simply one that is half its original size for virtually any other form of power generation its an all or nothing proposition . Furthermore , many experts agree that so-called micro-renewables will play an increasingly important role in the energy future of the planet and wind energy is the example par excellence of how this can be done ; the most basic homemade windmill can power a generator and wind power predates electricity offshore and on by centuries . 	Wind energy is an economic form of energy generation reducing both running costs and environmental harm
There is little doubt that the current mix of energy provision is simply unsustainable . Fossil fuels are simply too damaging to the environment and nuclear is just too expensive . Wind power is an established technology providing , for example , 21 % of electricity in Denmark . The research is already done and can be made available around the world . Once externalities are taken into account nuclear energy is the single most expensive way of producing a therm . Clean coal is , frankly , a myth and the trend for oil and gas is constantly upwards in term of price . Other renewables are embryonic technologies fraught with development costs whereas wind is an established technology already providing a significant share of the energy mix in several developed economies . 	Wind energy provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear power
The critical , and increasing , issue of a reliance on fossil fuels is that the price is not only increasing but is doing so in an unpredictable manner . Oil and gas in particular are subject to the political whim of some of the worlds most unpredictable regimes . Wind , by contrast , is produced domestically or , where it is exported , is produced in stable European nations . Given the choice between negotiating with Chavezs Venezuela or Putins Russia for oil and gas or with Belgium or Germany for wind energy is really not a difficult choice . Critically , in addition , any form of mineral-dependent energy is based on a resource that will deplete be that coal or uranium . Wind , by contrast , is the ultimate sustainable resource . 	Wind energy provides for price stability in the long-term , wind will be with us for the duration
In a world where state agencies would have the possibility of tracking everyones moves without any person knowing it , we would reach a point in which the population lose their trust in their elected officials . The consequences could then be very damaging to democracy . This phenomenon took place right after the NSA leaks , as the confidence in the US government was near records low . -LRB- 1 -RRB- First of all , the population would know that the government is spying and tracking their moves , but they wouldnt know how much . This general lack of information on this matter will create a lot of scepticism relating this process , and inevitably the population will reach the conclusion that the government is conducting massive phone tapping and spying campaigns as no one is checking on them . Despite potential official document trying to give certain facts regarding this , due to the previous incidents when the state has been releasing little or misleading information , these will have little influence over the population . As a result , trust in the state will suffer a massive blow . This is extremely problematic , as you want and need the general population to trust and listen to what the government , and more particularly law enforcement agencies , say in a lot of instances . When promoting non-discrimination , gender equality or increased social welfare contributions for the poor , you need the population to see the state as someone who is on the same side with them and someone who they can trust . Unfortunately , the scepticism with which those beneficial government proposals will be received will drastically reduce their impact and the chances of them being implemented . If I do not trust that the government is looking after my own good , but rather in a lot of instances its interests are mutually exclusive with mine , then I would most probably lose my respect towards authority . When talking about law enforcement agencies , i.e the police , the NSA , etc . , it is clear that we have trusted them to protect us and our rights . When it is those very agencies that are conducting these warrantless spying campaigns , it comes as a direct contradiction with their very purpose and thus the impact and the loss of trust is higher on this level . Moreover , in the long term , the whole electoral process could suffer a lot from this lack of confidence , as individuals arent particularly inclined to go to elections any more if they see that no matter what they do , their rights will still be breached . As you need the population to trust the government , so that its reforms are being met with positivism and not reluctance , you must not portray the government as an intrusive , harmful and ill-willing element of the society . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Harry J Enten Polls show Obama 's real worry : NSA leaks erode trust in government , 13 June 2013 	Reducing trust in the state
In the light of the recent NSA events -LRB- 1 -RRB- , we must try and see past this curtain of fog the government has put in front of us , trying to make us believe that everything it does , it does for our own good and that in this process the law is being respected to the letter . Unfortunately , if the necessary system of checks-and-balances between the government and the masses or judicial courts is lacking , it will always find ways to abuse its powers and violate our rights . Even with the warrant currently being mandatory when trying to tap ones phone , we see that Justice Departments warrantless spying increased 600 percent in decade -LRB- 2 -RRB- . If the government is currently invading our lives when we have specific laws banning it from doing so , why should we believe that this phenomenon wont escalate if we scrap those laws ? The government 's biggest limitation when actively trying to spy or follow a large group of people was technological ; it was difficult - if not impossible - to follow a lot of people for days at a time . But with surveillance tools its becoming cheaper and easier , as is proven by the astounding 1.3 million demands for user cell phone data in the last year seeking text messages , caller locations and other information -LRB- 3 . -RRB- Without the resource limitations that used to discourage the government from tracking you without good reason , the limits on when and how geolocation data can be accessed are unclear . A police department , for example , might not have the resources to follow everyone who lives within a city block for a month , but without clear rules for electronic tracking there is nothing to stop it from requesting every resident 's cell phone location history Considering these facts , it is clear that , as we live in a time when it would be extremely easy for the government to engage in mass surveillance of the population , we must enforce and harden the current laws for our own protection , rather than abandoning then for good . No matter what , George Orwells books should not be perceived as a model for shaping our society . At the end of the day , without any oversight , it would be extremely easy for the government to abuse this power given to it by electronic surveillance tools , without us ever knowing it . This system is the only thing left that prevents government agencies to violate our rights . -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- David Kravets Justice Departments Warrantless Spying Increased 600 Percent in Decade , 09.27.12 -LRB- 3 -RRB- Trevor Timm , Law Enforcement Agencies Demanded Cell Phone User Info Far More Than 1.3 Million Times Last Year , July 9 , 2012 	Warrants are needed to prevent abuse
Teachers are the most important resource in the classroom , without them students have nobody to lead them . However often teachers are poorly paid to ` manage ' a classroom of poorly behaved students . Even though most teachers may see their work as a vocation , such pressures can cause stress and depression . The National Union of Teachers estimates that half of all teachers in the UK have considered leaving the profession citing the above factors as the basis of this . This poor behaviour of the students may have a multitude of causes such as frustration that the lesson is too hard or too easy . In selective classes teachers can target a certain level at the class and do n't have to try to cope with a wide range of abilities , thus allowing the teacher to fulfil their chosen vocation rather than to only discipline the students . 	Selection makes it easier for teachers
Children are different and there should be different kinds of schools to meet their individual needs and talents . Children with a talent for music or sport should go to special schools to help them develop their gifts . Less academic children need a vocational education one that gives them useful skills to pre-pare them for the workplace . Bright children need more academic schools that push them to learn and achieve as much as they can . Selecting students by ability is the way to make sure we provide each one with the best type of education for them . For example in Germany pupils are streamed into a specific educational route at the age of 10 or 11 year olds where they largely remain for the remainder of their statutory education . A mixed-ability Gesamtschule was introduced to pursue a common base for learning but the majority of pupils enter the traditional selective system which is divided into three main types of secondary schooling . The Hauptschule offers some vocational-oriented courses as well as general subjects and leads to part-time enrolment in a vocational school combined with apprenticeship training until the age of 18 ; The Realschule leads to part-time and higher vocational schools and the Gymnasium , based on the classical education , leads to the Abitur and prepares students for university or a dual academic and vocational credential . It is possible for students with high academic achievement at the Realschule to switch to a Gymnasium on graduation . Germany scores higher than the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- in maths and literacy and has continued to improve these scores over the years as well as raising the achievement of the lowest per-forming pupils -LRB- PISA -RRB- . Susanne Wiborg , Education and Social Integration : a Comparative Study of the Comprehensive School System in Scandinavia , London Review of Education -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 2 , 2 . 	Schools should cater for individuality in children
Selection creates the opportunity for talented but financially unprivileged children to access academically excellent schools . The majority of parents are unable to afford private education and it is unfair to condemn children to a second rate education because of their parent 's earning power . This creates a more mobile society in which your ability matters more than how well-off your parents are . For example in Northern Ireland , which has a system of differentiated education consisting of grammar schools , secondary moderns and no independent schools , 42 % of students from the lower income groups go to university , compared with only 28 % from similar income groups in England . 	Selection bypasses discrimination by social background and can help with social mobility
Selective schools consistently score higher in league tables because all the students are of a similar ability the teacher can teach to that level , stretching or supporting them as necessary . Bright children can make faster progress and study more subjects at a higher level . There will also be less bad behaviour as bright children wo n't be getting bored with a slow pace , and less able students wo n't feel left behind . For example , in 2006 , the pupils in England 's 164 grammar -LRB- selective -RRB- schools produced more than half the total number of A grade A-levels in ` harder ' A-level subjects than those produced by pupils in up to 2,000 comprehensive school . 	Selective schools get better results
Freedom of speech certainly may be curtailed when real harms can be shown to arise from it . Extremist sites serve as centers of dangerous dissent , whose members threaten all of society . They promote a message that is fundamentally bad speech , because it can not it can not be argued with and promotes aims that are so anathema to free society that its dissemination represents a true threat to peoples safety . The threat extremists represent to free society demands that their right to speech online be curtailed . By blocking these sites , ISPs certainly are denying some freedom of speech , but it is a necessarily harmful form of speech that has no value in the global commons . Thus , there is essentially no real loss of valuable speech in censoring extremist websites . Kaplan , E. Terrorists and the Internet . Council on Foreign Relations . 8 January 2009 . 	The freedom of speech can be curtailed when it represents a serious threat to society
The greatest fear people have about extremist groups is not their rhetoric , but the actions the rhetoric precipitates . Extremists have proven adept at setting up basic websites through which to build communities to organize and coordinate extreme actions . This means in the most limited form the coordinating of extremist demonstrations and rallies , but also violent and terrorist actions . The best example of this is As-Sahab , al-Qaedas media arm , which has used an extensive web presence to galvanize supporters and to coordinate terrorist attacks . In using the tools of the mass media extremists have succeeded in bringing supporters to their cause , people who are often geographically diffuse , into a close community capable of action and disruption that harms all citizens . If blocking these websites entirely ISPs would pose a significant barrier to these extremist groups organising . Even more damaging to these networks in the long terms would be the drop in recruitment due to a reduction in their reach . ISPs can significantly hamper these organizations from ever embarking on serious violent actions , and from coalescing in the first place by denying them their most effective springboard . The most important effect is in the prevention of radicalization in the first place . Preventing , or at least hampering access to extremist materials serves to keep impressionable , swayable people from experiences that might turn them to extremism . Kaplan , E. Terrorists and the Internet . Council on Foreign Relations . 8 January 2009 . Silber , M. and Bhatt , A. , Radicalization in the West : The Homegrown Threat The New York City Police Department , 2007 . p. 83 	Blocking these sites makes it more difficult for extremist groups to coordinate extremist action in the real world
As the access providers for the internet ISPs are best placed to implement policies for blocking extremist sites and so are the natural option for deciding when and which sites to block . Furthermore , because the state is often slow due its extensive bureaucracy , it is less able to respond with alacrity to extremist sites popping up online . ISPs on the other hand are likely to be able to act as soon as they are informed of the existence of a website whereas working through government would simply add an extra layer of requests and orders . The ISPs blocking the site also creates a fire break between the state and the action so not giving the extremists the ammunition that state intervention might give them . Essentially , the good result of eliminating these sites from public access is accomplished faster , more effectively , and with lesser backlash than if any other agent did the blocking . 	ISPs are better placed than governments to make decisions on when and who to block
The ISPs are the gatekeepers of information . When the internet places no moral judgments on content and the ISPs let all information through without commentary , it lends an air of permissiveness to the beliefs put forward , that they are held by reasonable people . The internet is a great tool for education , but also one that can be used to sow misinformation and extreme rhetoric . Extremist groups have been able to use the internet to a remarkable extent in promoting their beliefs and recruiting new members . Worse still , the administrators of these extremist sites are able to choke of things like dissenting commenters , giving the illusion that their view is difficult , or even impossible to reasonably challenge . In doing so they create an echo chamber for their ideas that allows them to spread and to affect people , particularly young people susceptible to such manipulation . The best example of this activity is in the international jihadist community and its reaching out to people in the West . Young disaffected Muslims have received an introduction to militant Islamism from sites often based abroad , but also some domestically , increasing the number of believers in an extreme , militant form of that religion . By denying these people a platform on the internet , ISPs are able to not only make a moral stance that is unequivocal , but also to choke off access to new members who can be saved by never seeing the negative messages . Kaplan , E. Terrorists and the Internet . Council on Foreign Relations . 8 January 2009 . 	It makes it more difficult for extremists to organize and spread their message when blocked
ISPs are ultimately private providers of a service . Because of this they should retain the right to restrict that service to certain groups . So long as ISPs make public their policy for what constitutes extremism so that consumers can decide if they want to opt into it , there is no real issue . There are many filters available to users to screen out certain materials already , for example internet providers offer customers the option to block adult content , and this is merely an extension of this approach . Businesses must be able to sort their own ethos . Some ISPs may not opt to use this power given to them by the state , but others may not wish to carry content they consider dangerous . Because extremism is on the very fringe of speech and opinion , and because of the potential dangers that can arise from it , it is only right that the state give some ability to ISPs to block objectionable content . BBC News , Internet providers offer parents bar on porn 11 October 2011 , 	ISPs are private service providers and should thus be able to have some filters on the most extreme spectrums of extremism
In a welfare state such as the United Kingdom , everyone enjoys the same access to services provided by the government , and so it should stand to reason that everyone should also contribute equally to the funding of those services . As not all individuals are equal in their wealth and income , it is impossible to do this on the basis of everyone paying in the exact same numerical amount of money . However , this parity can be achieved by everyone paying the same percentage of their income in tax to the government , and this is exactly what a flat tax is , and so equality in contribution to government services -LRB- mirroring equality in access to government services -RRB- is achieved . This principle of equality is important for two reasons : firstly , if wealthier citizens feel they are being unfairly burdened by the current requirement that they pay higher percentages of their income to fund government services than those on lower incomes , they may feel a disincentive to work hard -LRB- which creates wealth for the whole economy -RRB- , or may even be driven abroad to states with lower rates of taxation or to tax havens . Secondly this removes the ability of the majority of a population to engage in what the French economist Bastiat called ` legalized plunder ' , where they -LRB- as the majority of voters -RRB- assign higher percentages of income tax to the wealthy in order that the state may appropriate and redistribute it to them for their own use . With a flat tax in place , there would be no ability for anyone to vote for a tax rise simply on other people and not on themselves , and thus such policies would receive more consideration and not be used by the majority simply to appropriate the property of others through the law . Thus a flat tax is fairer as it equalized the basis on which everyone pays for access to equal services , and prevents a poorer majority from victimizing a wealthier minority through punitive rates of income tax for the wealthy , which may cause them to flee the country for other states with less taxation . 	Why a flat tax is fairer
The current system of ` progressive ' taxation whereby higher earners are taxed a higher percentage of their income requires the identification and administration of multiple different tax brackets spanning the entire spectrum of earnings in a nation . This causes a number of problems . The brackets themselves may be largely arbitrary cut-off lines based around round numbers , with no real justification as to why one person increasing their earnings by as little as 1000 should lead to them suddenly being propelled to a new tax bracket , when the actual difference to their income is negligible in overall terms . Moreover , the administration of multiple tax brackets is incredibly complicated and difficult , requiring every taxpayer to record their income and expenditure -LRB- in order to try and qualify for tax exemptions and ` loopholes ' -RRB- in meticulous detail and then to properly express this on lengthy and complicated government forms , a process which can cause anger , frustration and alienation amongst taxpayers . In order to try and prevent tax evasion , governments are consequently compelled to have large bureaucracies that oversee this process and comb through looking for fraud , a costly and lengthy process . This may be contrasted with a flat tax system by taking the example of taxes on salaries paid to employees by a company under both systems . In the status quo , a tax collector must be aware in detail of exactly what is being paid to whom in order to ensure that everyone declares their income truthfully , allowing them to be placed in the correct bracket . However , under a flat tax , a tax collector could simply withhold the fixed flat tax rate -LRB- for example 20 % -RRB- of the total company 's payroll without needing to know what was paid to whom , as every pound is taxed at the same rate and thus it does not matter what goes to whom . This would allow for a massive simplification of tax forms , and for the down-scaling of the costly government departments dedicated to administering the different tax brackets . Thus the simplicity of a flat tax is a significant advantage . 	Why a flat tax is simpler :
Tax credits , deductions and loopholes distort resource allocation in a market situation because people respond to the differing tax rates and so put more resources into the areas which the loopholes apply to than they would otherwise . For example , current tax credits for investment mean that more resources go into investment than they would in the absence of that credit , as the returns on the placing of resources in this area are higher than others -LRB- as it is subject to a lower rate of tax -RRB- . A government may even set certain tax credits and loopholes which favour certain industries or economic sectors , such as agriculture , on the basis that this is politically useful -LRB- in winning votes -RRB- , when this again distorts resource allocation in the economy . These distortions may prove harmful as they cause certain sectors to be over-valued or over-invested in due to their favourable tax status , to the detriment and neglect of other more highly-taxed areas -LRB- for example , manufacturing -RRB- which may in fact be the more economically sound . A flat tax would abolish all ` credits ' and ` loopholes ' -LRB- and the politically-influenced government discretion which decides who gets credits and who does not -RRB- and therefore restore genuine market conditions without these harmful distortions . 	Why closing tax loopholes is good :
While a second Obama administration is not going to cut back on foreign aid the Obama campaign however , does argue for pragmatic budgetary approaches to foreign aid , creating transparency measures to ensure that assistance -LSB- is -RSB- more transparent , accountable and effective . The Obama administration has signed the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation which makes transparency a key pillar of overseas development and has succeeded in significantly increasing transparency ; in 2010 the U.S. was ranked 24 in Quality of Official Development Assistance rankings on transparency , by 2012 it had moved up to 9th . It is also clear how beneficial transparency is for the recipients of aid ; Uganda implemented Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys in 1996 . Surveys had shown that only 13 % of funds for schools was actually getting to the schools but the introduction of PETS increased this to between 80-90 % simply because it was public that the school should have received money . 	The foreign aid budget can be made more effective and transparent
Despite a large national deficit , the Obama administration has stated over and over again that they have no plans to cut Official Development Assistance -LRB- ODA -RRB- , and the 2011 budget reflects that by putting the United States on a path to double foreign assistance by 2015 . The Obama administration has requested $ 56 billion for international affairs in Fiscal Year 2013 that would go towards USAID funding and programs . This would go a considerable way towards the target , first pledged in 1970 , of rich countries committing 0.7 % of GNP to Official Development Assistance . This increase is necessary because Obama has increasing commitments to meet . The administration wants to embrace the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to cut global poverty by 2015 in hopes that foreign assistance can help countries build healthy and educated communities , reduce poverty , develop markets , and generate wealth . The Obama administration wants to increase foreign assistance to make investments to combat terrorism , corruption and transnational crime , improve global education and health , reduce poverty , build global food security , expand the Peace Corps , address climate change , stabilize post-conflict states , and reinforce conflict prevention . In a speech promoting good governance in Ghana , President Obama stated , the true sign of success is not whether we are a source of aid that helps people scrape byit is whether we are partners in building the capacity for transformational change . The goal remains to expand diplomatic and development capacity while renewing the United States as a global leader . 	The aid budget has to increase to meet rising commitments
While foreign aid is obviously for the benefit of the recipient country that country is not the only one that benefits ; U.S. business is often a major beneficiary . It does this in two ways : First they benefit directly through carrying out the contracts for supplying aid , for example Cargill was paid $ 96million for supplying food aid in 2010-11 . Secondly there are also indirect benefits . Through the work of the United States Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- , the Obama administration hopes to develop partnerships with countries committed to enabling the private sector investment that is the basis of sustained economic growth to open new markets for American goods , promote trade overseas , and create jobs here at home . Essentially , through foreign aid , both the economies of the developing world and the United States come out ahead . Even Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has been quoted as saying that the 1 percent the United States spends on foreign aid not only saves millions of lives , it has an enormous impact on developing countries which means it has an impact on our economy . 	Foreign aid benefits the United States
Employers and others expect certain degrees to mean certain things ; they are more than just an expensive badge . In the case of elite western universities part of what that means is a critical approach to the world and the willingness to challenge ideas , regardless of the authority that holds them . Part of their exclusivity derives from their admission standards , partly from the academic rigour of their scholars and partly from the simple fact that there are only a relatively small number of graduates . In other areas universities are all too aware of selling their reputation impartiality , avoiding plagiarism and so forth the same should be true here . If a degree from a western university does not mean that it recognises issues such as creativity and free thinking then it devalues the degree itself . As a result the very governments that are so keen to acquire the creative , critical skills offered by graduates of western-style education will end up undermining the very thing that they seek . This impacts not only the graduates from Asian campuses of western universities but also their peers at the home institution . 	Maintaining the value of the degree
The growth of universities as beacons of free speech has been a fundamental part of their history in the West ; notably during the renaissance , reformation and enlightenment . The democratisation of that process with the expansion of the university sector in recent decades is merely the latest stage in an ongoing process . However , that entire process has been driven -LRB- along with the artistic , cultural and scientific changes they have inculcated -RRB- on the basis that universities allow for the free exchange of ideas and flourish in environments where that approach is standardised throughout society . Marxist scholars have gone further in calling for a critical pedagogy in which perspectives other than academic orthodoxy are normalised within universities . Such institutions produce the best graduates because they have the best academics and the best academics will stay where they are free to publish whatever their research is and express their own views . For example in the 1990s 55.7 % of those who had immigrated to the USA from the USSR described themselves as academics , scientists , professional or technical workers . Those academics in turn respect the intellectual tradition of dissent and critical scrutiny of which they are the inheritors . To take something else and slap the name Yale or for that matter Oxford , Harvard or ETH Zurich on it and pretend that nothing has changed devalues the qualification . Without the intellectual dissent and freedom of academic inquiry it is intellectually dishonest to call the degree the same thing . 	The academic tradition of the West
The EU might function as an economic union , but its original goal was to prevent war from ever happening again on the European continent . The political resolution of the Congress of Europe in 1948 said it is the urgent duty of the nations of Europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress the creation of a United Europe is an essential element in the creation of a united world . The Economic integration is a means to this goal , by making member states economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other . Given this history , the EU can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use soft power in a foreign policy context . Europe has been successful in creating peace on a previously warlike continent . It has also had successes in encouraging reform in the countries of Eastern Europe and is continuing to do so in the Balkans through enlargement . Croatia was at war with its neighbors fifteen years ago and part of Yugoslavia twenty years ago but will become the 28 member of the EU in 2013 . Being a member of the UNSC would deepen Europes commitment to international peace-keeping and peace-making missions , something which currently varies very widely between member states , and push them to spend sufficient on equipping their militaries for such missions . The UNSC could turn the EUs soft power outwards to help the world . As a result it should have a seat at the worlds foremost foreign policy institution . 	The European Union is meant to prevent war being on the UNSC would allow it to actively promote peace .
In the past the European Union has not had the necessary foreign policy bureaucracy and decision making capabilities to be able to control a UNSC seat . Since the Lisbon treaty this has changed . The Treaty created a President of the European Council , currently Herman Van Rompuy . And a European External Action Service -LRB- EEAS -RRB- which will eventually have a staff of 5,400 . The EEAS is a functionally autonomous EU body with a large number of embassies around the world . This will give the EU representation in most countries , 54 with ambassadors out of a total of 136 , and the ability to coordinate a foreign policy . A seat at the United Nations Security Council would be a natural extension of this . 	The EU now has the necessary foreign policy organs .
The permanent seats for France and the UK are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of World War II . However , the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then : France and the UK have declined ; Britains manufacturing exports dropped from 25 % of world manufacturing exports in 1945 to 5 % in 2000 . And the UK was 6.52 % of the world economy in 1950 but down to 3.56 in 2010 . Moreover both had large empires which were lost in the decades after 1945 . At the same time the EU has emerged as a major player in the international arena . The EU is one of the worlds largest trade blocs , has the worlds largest GDP , and represents almost half a billion people . A permanent seat for the EU would reflect those new power dimensions . 	The world has moved on since 1945 .
The most practical way to reform the United Nations is for France and Britain to give way to a European Union seat . Although there would inevitably be some loss of influence for both nations the pain would be minimised by retaining one seat between them . The European Union often decides what countries get what jobs based upon internal politics , so for example Catherine Ashton became High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy because Tony Blair did not get the presidency . It would therefore be possible through an internal agreement in the European Union to make sure that France and the United Kingdom retain control of the UNSC seat through having control of the foreign minister post and the post of Ambassador to the United Nations . 	France and Britain should be willing to give up their seats for the European Union .
The United Nations is a global body that must represent the whole world . Just as democratic governments need to remain representative to be legitimate so the same is true of intergovernmental organisations . If the UK and France hang on to their permanent seats forever , the UNSC will lose its legitimacy , as the United Nations will no longer be seen to be representative . The result will be an increased risk of war and conflict because the worlds major powers have no legitimate shared arena for discussing their interests . This is exactly what happened to the League of Nations after World War I . As many of the most powerful nations , USA , USSR and Germany were unwilling to join or barred from joining the League never had much legitimacy . As a result the League was unable to prevent conflicts in Manchuria and Abyssinia -LRB- Ethiopia -RRB- eventually leading to World War II . Since their interest in a stable world through the legitimacy of the UNSC outweighs their interest in a formal veto-power , France and the UK should be willing to give up their veto power . 	Only a more representative United Nations Security Council is legitimate .
Professional cheerleaders are bad role models for women , and especially for teenagers who take part in cheerleading . They tend to wear shorter skirts and show more of their skin than college and high school cheerleaders . In addition , their routines tend to be more obviously sexual , and less focused on gymnastic stunts . When young girls at high school level are encouraged to do so , it is problematic because the sexualisation of cheer routines reinforces the idea that macho men , playing sports -LRB- a traditionally male field -RRB- are sexually rewarded or gratified for their macho performance . It reinforces the glamour of being a macho man and these men can begin to feel entitled to sexual gratification . This can lead to anger when they are turned down , which can escalate to sexual violence against women , for example , the case of the high school cheerleader who was sexually assaulted by a member of her basketball team that she cheered for . 	Professional cheerleading sexualises teenagers and young women
Professional cheerleaders affect how people view women in general , and therefore there is harm to society . Although freedom of choice is often important , it is inhibited at the point that one person starts to harm others or society . As this happens in this case , cheerleading should be banned . 	Cheerleading undermines important social norms
A large number of women and teenage girls suffer from eating disorders . Part of the desire to be thin comes from the constant parade of perfect women . Professional cheerleaders often have much of their body on show , and as men cheer them and comment on their looks , the message to women is reinforced : it is important to fit a specific version of beauty . 	The superficiality of cheerleading means that cheerleaders are poor role models for young girls
Professional cheerleaders discourage lots of women , religious people and families from attending professional sports games . Many people do not want to watch women dancing on the pitch wearing skimpy clothes , so do not attend . Similarly , they do not bring their children because they think that it is inappropriate . Professional sports games are a great way to bring people together to form a community . It also encourages children to take part in sport themselves , improving their health . Professional cheerleaders are harmful because they discourage such attendance . 	Cheerleading harms school attendance and academic achievement
Women are very talented at sport , as demonstrated by Venus and Serena Williams in tennis , Paula Radcliff in athletics or Nastia Liukin in gymnastics . However , when people see cheerleaders they are more likely to view womens role in sport as one confined to looking pretty on the sidelines . Womens sport already receives a lot less coverage than mens sport , and it is important to promote the success that women achieve . Professional cheerleaders detract from this . This is further true considering that many of the women participating in professional cheerleading would no doubt be very talented at other athletic pursuits . The perception of women as on the side-lines is so ingrained that most womens sport teams do not have a cheer squad and in several high schools in the US , cheerleaders have been uncomfortable when asked to cheer for girls sports teams . 	Cheerleading denies women a more central role in sport
Cheerleading is a highly strenuous sport . It combines gymnastics with dance . It is also high impact , very energetic and requires sophisticated synchronized moves . Not only do college teams and high school teams cheer their sports teams , but they also perform at competitions . Professional squads , however , exist for the sole purpose of cheering their professional sports team . Because the seeming professionals are only supporting their team and are only there to entertain , it diminishes the overall status of cheerleading as a sport . This is unfair since it is a highly demanding activity that should be considered a sport , and yet the girls and boys who participate in college and high school are not considered real athletes . 	The excesses of professional cheerleading undermines the reputation of high school and college cheerleading
Slaughter without stunning is painful for the animal . All slaughter methods which do not involve stunning work by bleeding the animal so that it suffers brain-death . This is normally done by cutting the neck . Depending on the species of animal , it can survive for anything between 20 seconds and 2 minutes after this . Although animals cant tell us if they are in pain , the best metrics we have brain activity , eye movement and making sounds indicate that the animals are in pain during this period . Rendering the animal unconscious stops it feeling pain immediately . When we have two methods of killing the animal available , it is inhumane to use the more painful one . It follows that we should require stunning . Federation of Veterinarians of Europe , Slaughter of animals without prior stunning , , FVE/02/104 , 2002 , 	Slaughter without stunning is painful for the animal
Meat from animals slaughtered without stunning can turn up anywhere . Some parts of each animal are not used in kosher food , and they are generally sold on the normal market . This means any supermarket product could turn out to have such meat in it . Halal food is even more common , and many places serve halal meat as standard . So we can not just consider the religious community : this meat reaches everyone . People with concerns about the way their food is produced would be distressed if they knew they were eating meat which had been inhumanely slaughtered . The fact that they dont actually know is neither here nor there we should bear in mind their ethical positions . Everyone is eating the meat , so everyone has a say . Banning the production of this meat would remove it from the food chain and help make sure people know what theyre eating . Fagge , Nick , Halal Britain : Schools and institutions serving up ritually slaughtered meat , , 25 January 2011 , 	Since this meat is often sold unlabeled , this affects everyone
It is important for animal rights to be represented in political discourse . The animal rights movement has many supporters . People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -LRB- PETA -RRB- has 3 million members worldwide . In the UK , the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals -LRB- RSPCA -RRB- and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds -LRB- RSPB -RRB- are both in the 15 wealthiest charities . The point of democracy is that people decide collectively how they want their state to run . In one poll in the UK , 45 % of people backed a ban on shechita . Democracy requires that we take this seriously , and if the animal rights movement wins the debate then we should implement a ban . Membership Services , , accessed 30 May 2013 , Rogers , Simon , Britain 's top 1,000 charities ranked by donations . Who raises the most money ? , , 24 April 2012 , Rocker , Simon , Forty five per cent of Britons ready to ban Shechita , , 27 March 2013 , 	Animal welfare is a legitimate political aim
It is important to treat animals as kindly as we can . Not causing harm to others is among the basic human rights . Although these rights can not be said to apply directly to animals , we should extend them a certain respect as living , sentient beings , and as a minimum we should avoid causing them unnecessary harm . Moreover , taking animal welfare seriously will accustom us to considering the effects of our actions in other contexts , and help us be generally sensitive to cruelty . Inflicting unnecessary harm on animals is therefore a bad thing . Many governments already have many policies aimed at preventing this . For example , in 2004 the UK passed a law banning hunting with dogs on the grounds that it is cruel . The Council of Europe and through it the European Union already requires stunning , with an exception for religious practices . Removing this exception is the best course for animal welfare . Killing animals for food may not be philosophically wrong after all , many species do the same . But if we are going to do so , we should cause as little harm as possible in the process , and this requires using humane slaughter methods .

Catholics consider the first commandment given to them by God to be to ` multiply ' . In light of this , anything that limits procreation , be it the use of contraception or even condoning the use of contraception , is against God . It is important to remember that the Catholic Church 's primary obligation is not to its people but to God . The Church is , therefore , justified in any action where the alternative is going against what they believe to be the wishes of God , even if it is harmful to the people of the Church . 1:28 , The Book of Genesis , The Bible . 	The Catholic Church believes that any limitation of procreation is against God .
Whenever a Church makes a radical change to its doctrines and teachings it causes a huge amount of tension within the Church . An excellent example of this is the Church of England allowing women to become bishops ; a huge number of people left the Church over the controversy . Since the Catholic Church 's ban over contraception of all kinds is something that it has stood fast over for a great number of years , as well as something that sets it apart from most other denominations and faiths , the proposition believes that a change in this would result in a huge amount of tension within the Church . This tension would inevitably bring about a considerable risk of large parts of the Church collapsing altogether . This would be much the same as the tensions over gay priests in the Anglican church that have led to fears of a schism . Therefore , in the interests of its own stability , the sensible course of action for the Catholic Church to take is to maintain its ban on contraception . 	Radical changes risk the stability of the Catholic Church .
It is important to remember that the Catholic Church believe that barrier contraception is against God and that using it will condemn people to Hell . Therefore , even if the Church 's stance on condoms is harmful , which the proposition does not accept that it is , it is less harmful than people spending an eternity suffering . In this context , therefore , the most responsible thing for the Catholic Church to do is to forbid the use of condoms and , thereby , save people from Hell . 	Protects people from spending eternity in Hell .
Condoning the use of barrier methods of contraception would be implicitly condoning casual sex since their primary function is within that context . This is particularly important since the Catholic Church 's teachings on casual sex are not taken particularly seriously already . Any action , such as the Catholic Church allowing the use of barrier contraception , that would promote casual sex in countries with severe AIDS/HIV problems , would be an incredibly irresponsible one . Pope Paul VI argued that when considering `` the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control . Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards . '' The Church 's current stance on barrier contraception , therefore , is the most responsible one . 	Going back on this rule would promote casual sex
The Catholic Church does not only forbid the use of barrier contraception but also of casual sex . The issue is not that the Church is being irresponsible by banning the use of barrier contraception but that people are choosing to follow some of the Church 's teachings but not others . Pope Benedict XVI argues AIDS is `` a tragedy that can not be overcome by money alone , that can not be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which even aggravates the problems '' . If people followed the Church 's teachings on casual sex as well as their teachings on barrier contraception , the AIDS epidemic would be dramatically decreased . Given , therefore , that it also forbids any sex outside of marriage , the Catholic Church is totally justified in forbidding barrier methods of contraception . 	In context of other teachings , does not promote the spread of AIDS/HIV .
Entrepreneurialism can be encouraged through an awareness , and sharing , of new ideas . The technological revolution has provided a platform for personal expression , delivery of up-to-date news , and the vital sharing of local ideas and thoughts . In Nigeria the Co-Creation Hub has emerged , encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit . Further , Umuntu and Mimiboards are connecting individual communities to the web by encouraging local content creation . Such platforms are enabling the transfer of knowledge and innovative ideas . Innovative solutions are being introduced to routine problems , such as Mafuta Go an app to find the best price for petrol -LRB- Christine Ampaire -RRB- . See further readings : Co-Creation Hub Nigeria , 2013 	Technology is building a platform for sharing ideas .
Technology has enabled the development of entrepreneurial ideas for business , but also within Africas cultural industry . Access to video recording mobile phones , the internet , and televised publications has created a new culture of expression for African youths . Cultural industries are raising critical questions for politics , and empowering youth to tell their stories . The use of journalism has become mobilised by youths - as seen in initiatives such as , African Slum Voices , of which are encouraging youths to pro-actively raise their opinions and voices on issues occurring within their communities . Furthermore , the music and film industry in Africa has arisen as a result of access to new technologies at a lower-cost . Two key components responsible for the growth of Nollywood -LRB- Nigerias Film Industry -RRB- include access to digital technology and entrepreneurship . Youths have become vital within Nollywood , as actors , producers and editors . Today Nollywoods low-budget films have inspired the growth of regional film industries across Africa and contributed to its status as the third largest film industry . Nollywoods revenue stands at around $ 200mn a year . See further readings : ABN , 2013 . 	Technology has enabled Africas cultural industries to grow .
A key technology for youths are mobile phones and devices . Across West and East Africa the possession of mobile phones has enabled citizens to network and form solutions to social problems . By 2015 , there are expected to be 1 billion mobile cellular subscriptions in Sub-Saharan Africa -LRB- Sambira , 2013 -RRB- . This is the first African generation directly accessing high-technology , although uncertainty remains in the amount of youths having access to technology . Through mobile phones new business opportunities , and flows of money , are being created . Furthermore , mobile phones are providing innovative solutions to health care treatment , ensuring better health for future entrepreneurs and youths . SlimTrader is a positive example . SlimTrader uses mobile phones to provide a range of vital services - from airplane and bus tickets to medicine . The innovative e-commerce provides a space to advertise skills , products , and opportunities - to , on the one hand , identify new consumer demands ; and on another hand , create notices to exchange goods . Mobile technology is making it faster , quicker , and simpler to tap into new markets . See further readings : SlimTrader , 2013 ; Ummeli , 2013 . See further readings : Nsehe , 2013 .

The rate of unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa remains above the global average , at 7.55 % in 2011 , with 77 % of the population in vulnerable employment . Economic growth has not been inclusive and jobs are scarce . In particular , rates of youth unemployment , and underemployment , remain a concern . On average , the underutilisation of youths in the labour market across Sub-Saharan Africa stood at 67 % in 2012 -LRB- Work4Youth , 2013 -RRB- . Therefore 67 % of youths are either unemployed , inactive , or in irregular employment . The rate of unemployment varies geographically and across gender . There remains a high percentage of youths within informal employment . Technology can introduce a new dynamic within the job market and access to safer employment . Secure , high quality jobs , and more jobs , are essential for youths . Access to technology is the only way to meet such demands . Technology will enable youths to create new employment opportunities and markets ; but also employment through managing , and selling , the technology available . ILO , 2013 . Definitions : Unemployment is defined as the amount of people who are out of work despite being available , and seeking , work . Underemployment defines a situation whereby the productive capacity of an employed person is underutilised . Informal employment defines individuals working in waged and/or self employment informally -LRB- see further readings -RRB- . Work4Youth -LRB- 2013 -RRB- show , on average , Madagascar has the lowest rate of unemployment -LRB- 2.2 % -RRB- while Tanzania has the highest -LRB- 42 % -RRB- ; and the average rate of female unemployment stands higher at 25.3 % , in contrast to men -LRB- 20.2 % -RRB- . 	Technology will lead job growth for youths .
Technology has enabled access to e-books and resources for students and teachers . Such changes have enabled improved efficiency in teaching , with the availability of up-to-date resources and awareness of relevant theories . Furthermore , the ease by which students are able to access multiple resources and buy books online is expanding their intellectual curiosity and library . In addition to raising new students , technology can be seen as a tool for democracy . Technology provides a tool for government accountability , transparency in information , and for good governance . Organisations , such as Ushahidi -LRB- Crowdmapping -RRB- following Kenyas 2007 post-election violence ; and mySociety which updates citizens on parliamentary proceedings in South Africa , show how technology is feeding democratisation for youths .

As a follow up to the six point plan on the 1 July in Geneva it was agreed that a transitional government would be set up which could include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent . Mutual consent however means both sides have a veto ; Assad would have to agree and he is not going to agree to a government which he is not involved in . The opposition meanwhile argues The country has been destroyed and they want us then to sit with the killer ? With neither side willing to consider sitting down with the other it is difficult to see how Annans plan can ever get anywhere no matter how long it is kept on life support . 	The Syrian opposition will never be willing to deal with Assad .
The plan is simply being used as political cover by Assad , as long as he is signed up to such an agreement and other countries believe there is a chance that he will implement it the Russians and Chinese will not allow further Security Council action . Both the Russians and Chinese are showing that they are willing to support Assad by vetoing anything hinting at sanctions . Therefore the only thing the Annan plan does is provide more time for Assad to go on killing his own people so that he can remain in power as is shown by his unwillingness to implement any of the plans provisions . 	The plan is just political cover for Assad .
A custodial sentence is capable of destroying the relationships and livelihood of an offender . Imprisonment means that an offender will be unable to work and will lose his job , if he has one . Statistics sourced from the Pew Foundation indicate that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a black , male American securing a job by up to 57 % . The isolation inherent in imprisonment can lead to the breakup of marriages and to the decay of relationships between parents and children . The stigma associated with a custodial sentence may result in an offender being shunned by his friends , his family and his community . He will , in effect , be left with no sources of support once he is released . A former inmate will be left with no incentive to adjust his behaviour and disengage with criminality . The Pew Foundation notes that 43 % of offenders in the United States were returned to prison within three years of release . The long-term damage done to an offender 's life is not an intended consequence of custodial sentencing . However , it can not be claimed to be a proportionate response to crime , as it affects both serious offenders and those accused of non-violent offences such as burglary or fraud . The decay of an offender 's relationships and social support structures is yet another harmful externality of custodial punishment.A corporal sentence caters to the social imperative to punish criminals , but it also allows offenders to remain with their families and to avoid financial hardship by remaining in employment . In Moskos ' own words , corporal punishment allows society to express its disapproval quickly and efficiently , leaving the offenders to `` move on '' with the process of reform . It is in the interests of any effective system of rehabilitation to ensure that a non-violent offender remains in contact with their family and remains in employment -LRB- excepting , of course , offenders who have attack or abused family members -RRB- . Families , spouses and social networks can play an important role in supporting and encouraging an offender to engage with rehabilitation programmes . Wives and children can effectively monitor an offender 's behaviour when trained staff are unavailable , integrating the reform process with the offender 's day to day life . `` A Plague of Prisons : The Epidemiology of Mass Incarceration in America '' . Drucker , E . The New Press 	Custodial sentences make recidivism more likely
The criminologist Peter Moskos observes that most of us , if given the choice , would opt to receive ten lashes rather than spend five years in prison . Paradoxically , a significant number of us would condemn corporal punishment as barbaric and inhumane . If imprisonment is a more rational response to criminal behaviour , why would so many rational individuals opt to receive corporal punishment ? Contemporary prisons are the result of a failed utopian experiment . They serve no useful rehabilitative purpose , and exist only to fulfil a common desire to punish deviant behaviour and to segregate criminals from the public at large . Prisons harm inmates and obstruct attempts to reintegrate them into society . It may be necessary to incarcerate certain compulsive and habitually violent criminals , but for a majority of offenders , prison only serves exacerbate underlying social , economic and psychological problems that lead to criminality . Using corporal punishment to reduce or replace custodial sentences would provide an effective way to fulfil the social need to punish criminals , while removing the harmful externalities of mass incarceration . Strictly supervised whipping or caning can adequately and proportionately express societys anger with the criminal , while avoiding the dangers of long-term incarceration and reinvigorating the use of rehabilitation . In the United States , the UK and many European countries , prison populations have increased dramatically , but reductions in rates of offending have been minimal or non existent . In the absence of funding , or coherent , centrally administered rehabilitation strategies , prisons have become places devoid of productive activity . Prisoners are not encouraged to address the causes of their offending , or to acquire skills that will help them to live independently in society following their release . Boredom , overcrowding and under-staffing have led to the emergence of gang - and drug-cultures in many prisons . Inmates incarcerated for minor offences quickly become complicit in gang violence , or fall prey to alcoholism and drug addiction . Gang associations and chemical dependencies carry over into inmates lives once they are released . The prison system serves only to breed criminality , not to cure it . The cost of incarcerating the average offender in the United Kingdom is estimated to be 45000 a year . Reduced spending on incarceration can be used to fuel an increase in spending on detoxification , rehabilitation and restorative justice schemes . Moreover damaging effects of prison will not cancel out the positive effects of rehabilitation . The physical injuries resulting from whipping , although painful , are less severe than the subtler damage wrought on inmates by imprisonment . 	Flogging harms offenders less than imprisonment
The failures of the prison system are tolerated within political culture and by the public , partly because the privations of the prison environment are seen as a suitable punishment for criminal behaviour . Deprivation of liberty and the emptiness of criminal life are seen as retribution for criminals ' dishonest or violent activities . Politicians dare not confront the damaging effects of imprisonment for fear of being labelled as `` soft '' on crime . There is greater political cache to be gained from introducing policies that prolong prison terms , and remove judges ' discretion to order non custodial sentences . Novel approaches to the problem of criminality are seen as signs of political weakness . The use of monitored corporal punishment will keep offenders who have not committed serious crimes out of the prison system . At a nominal rate of five lashes for every year of incarceration , flogging will serve as a clear demonstration of societal disapproval , satisfying popular conceptions of retributive `` justice '' . Once the need to punish is satisfied , policy makers will be free to institute new rehabilitation schemes that address the root causes of criminal behaviour ; these schemes can be set up without sacrificing political capital or appearing to prioritise the rights of criminals over victims or the public . 	Prison reform is politically unachievable
On matters as diverse as healthcare to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , President Obama has pulled a whole series of rabbits out of the apparently impossible hat he inherited from Bush . Among other surprises he took the lead in a G20 summit that produced $ 1.1 tn to act as a bailout fund . Hes effectively resolved the catastrophes in two major conflict zones . Hes ensured that poor families actually stay in their homes . Increased funding for student loans , extended unemployment insurance at a time when 7,000 Americans a week were losing their benefits and , on top of all that hes introduced a healthcare package that will give security and peace of mind to millions of Americans . All of this has been accomplished in the face of extraordinary difficulties that were not of his making . 	Obama has delivered some remarkable reforms in fantastically difficult circumstances
Given the size of the challenges facing the Obama administration when he was elected , they were never going to be resolved in four years . Perhaps his largest mistake was not amending his Yes , we can slogan with the caveat but its going to take a while . A debt of $ 14tn was never just going to vanish like the morning mist , particularly in the depths for a recession caused , in large part , by the Bush administrations inability to regulate their friends in the banking industry , to start unnecessary wars and to give away tax breaks to the rich . Equally , Obama came into the job at a time when most of the rest of the world was barely on speaking terms with the US and has had to rebuild bridges with all of the traditional allies beyond the ever loyal UK and Israel although even they were looking edgy by the end of the bush era . Even getting up to the starting line has taken the better part of his first term , it would be folly to hand the country and the economy back to the same people who caused the problem in the first place . 	After eight years of misrule under Bush , in the middle of an appalling recession expecting everything top get done in four years was always fantasy
Science provides us with the tools to form a comprehensive view of the Universe which does not include a supernatural being . From Galileo to Darwin to the modern day , scientists have continually uncovered the true natural mechanisms behind the creation and evolution of the universe . There are no gaps left for God to act in - science has revealed a closed natural order governed by natural laws . Brain science has shown that there is not a soul but that all our mental states are simply caused by brain activity . There is , therefore , no reason to believe in life after death - one of the main tenets of religious belief . 	The God hypothesis is unnecessary
There is no evidence that God exists . Reported miracles , healings etc . are never reliably proved actually to have happened , and in any case everyones religious experiences are different and point to the psychological differences between human beings not to any objective divine reality . Belief in God is simply wish-fulfilment . It would be nice if there was a loving all powerful being watching over us , but there isnt . 	Religious belief is completely irrational
Religions through the ages , and still today , have been agents of repression , sexism , elitism , homophobia , and - most of all - conflict , war , and racial hatred . The very nature of belief in received wisdom means that it must be , at its core , a conservative and regressive force . Moreover the positive moral rules that religions claim to promote tend to have existed independently of those religions the world did not have to wait for the ten commandments to learn that murder and theft was wrong , but it waited until the 19 Century to reach a consensus that Slavery was wrong . Whatever small amount of psychological comfort religious belief may give , the evils it is responsible for in the social and political worlds easily outweigh it . 	Religions have no true claim to special moral knowledge
Year-round schooling often goes hand in hand with multi-tracking , where different groups of students at the same school are on different schedules . This has the advantage of allowing school rooms , facilities and other resources to be used more efficiently , thus providing a better education without putting even more strain on government budgets . 	More efficient use of school resources and premises .
The structure of the school year is often one of the few fixed points in young peoples lives . For many children , particularly those from poorer families , long summer holidays dont mean summer camps and foreign holidays , but day after day sitting in front of the TV or hanging around in their neighbourhood . All the evidence suggests that boredom is a major factor behind social problems like drug use , youth crime and antisocial behaviour . Year-round schooling would not get rid of problems like these , of course , but it might help to reduce the level of such behaviour by giving young people something to do . 	Reduce social problems from disaffected , bored youth .
For many parents , particularly those with more than one child , summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time . Without the structure provided by school attendance , children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope . This is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present , or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood ; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible . Year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms . 	Year-round learning can help reduce the burden on parents .
A nations most important resource is its human capital , and in the modern world it is vital to have a skilled , educated workforce in order to remain competitive . Many nations have already adopted year-round schooling . By following their example , we will be giving our young people an important advantage in the employment market and thereby improving the countrys economic prospects . 	Importance of education to national economic performance .
In the process of creating , effectively an entire new industry , there are myriad infrastructural considerations which companies are poorly placed to deliver . Companies rely on government to train graduate and other staff , to plan for and deal with the externalities of industry and , perversely , to regulate them . The energy industry , in particular has not demonstrated a notable capacity to undertake any of these task voluntarily and there is little reason to believe that they would act any differently in the future . As long as there is a market for oil engineers universities and others have little interest in training a new generation of experts , indeed , given the structure of university departments there is an active disincentive to making ones own field of research redundant . This means the intervention has to come from the government ; departments could change their focus to being on renewable energy but it wont happen without government backing . Similarly engineers could be retrained to work in the renewable industry by the government . 	Only government is in a position to tie together the necessary legislation in terms of training , jobs and environmental standards
The market has no interest in altering a model in which scarcity increases profitability as is the case with the current market . Within that context there is little likelihood that they will provide , with no stimulus , the front-loaded investment necessary for the development of new technologies . Instead the state has the capacity to offer both the carrot of guaranteeing a future market and the stick of regulating future carbon emissions . Left unchecked the market has little or no interest to innovate and has the encouragement of the profit motive not to . However , corporations have an interest in the sustainability of their individual businesses so will move to new technologies , even if more expensive , if necessary but that will only be the case if the government creates that market artificially . 	Standards that are enforced by government legislation means that companies know there will be a guaranteed market for innovations
Governmental and inter-governmental policies can be focused on decades in the future rather than on the next product launch . Energy policy in particular operates on long time scales due to the very long build time for new power plants . Equally , governments have the power to regulate and , where necessary , compel individuals and organizations to comply with those regulations . Moreover governments interests are very different from the interests of business ; governments interest is in the future welfare of their citizens not their own profit and is as much for the young as the current working generation . By contrast the market has an interest in avoiding or in the case of carbon trading , moving - the problem . Energy companies not to mention heavy industry and manufacturing have a commercial interest in maximizing energy use as it relates directly to maximizing output . Energy companies want consumers to use more of their product , car manufacturers want consumers to travel more even if this means using more fuel . If a manufacturer expands they increase their energy consumption and if a consumer is to buy a good they are then increasing their own energy consumption , therefore increasing energy use is , ultimately perceived as a positive outcome . However , every serious report on the subject sees a reduction in the consumption of energy as an important , indeed critical , part of the solution to the challenges posed by climate change and peak oil . 	The government is better placed to consider longer term implications than companies that are legally required to maximize profit
Participation in sport promotes health . The effect on self-esteem and well-being as a product of sport can only be experienced by certain children if forced by their schools to first participate . A recent report to the European Parliament declared ` physical education is a springboard for involvement in sport and physical activities throughout life . Government is , or should be , concerned with the health of its citizens . Encouraging physical activity in the young through compulsory PE fights child obesity and contributes to forming lifelong habits of exercise . This doesnt have to be through traditional team sports ; increasingly schools are able to offer exercise in the form of swimming , gymnastics , dance , weight training , use of a multi-gym , aerobics , etc Hardman , K. -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . European Parliament 	Participation in sport promotes a healthy lifestyle
Physical education helps to forge character and the mutual respect required to succeed in an adult environment . Playing team sports builds character and encourages students to work with others , as they would be expected to do in most business or sporting environments . Sport teaches children how to win and lose with good grace and builds a strong school spirit through competition with other institutions . It is invaluable to imbue with children the delicate balance between a competitive rivalry that encourages effort and , on the other hand , losing the fairness and respect required to enjoy sport . It is often the experience of playing on a team together which builds the strongest friendships at school , which endure for years afterwards . As was noted in a report to the European Parliament , ` PE ... helps children learn to respect and value their own bodies and abilities , and those of others ' Compulsory physical education is the only means by which all children can be forced to appreciate such advantages . Hardman , K. -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . Current situation and prospects for physical education in the European Union . European Parliament . 	Physical education helps to forge skills that will prove invaluable in later life
Without school support , sports will collapse . If compulsory physical education classes are n't in place , then team activities will end by sheer lack of numbers , no matter if several very talented individuals are at the school -LRB- or even potentially talented theyll never know without the program -RRB- . New surveys in the United Kingdom have found that they expect to see a fall in sporting events provided in schools due to cost-cutting , despite the upcoming Olympics inspiring students to want to compete . If voluntary take-up of sport in schools is too low , then schools will shut down PE programmes so that there is no choice at all . Not everyone is academic : why deprive those talented sports students of their one chance to shine ? Athletes who lack academic prowess are required to stick at classes like maths even if it appears obvious their career path is in sport ; why should mathematicians escape from their respective obligation to compete in sports ? 	Sports teams require the support of schools and the encouragement of physical education
The quest for national sporting achievement begins in schools . If schools do n't have compulsory PE , it is much harder to pick out , develop and equip athletes to represent the country on a wider stage . Even with a ` sports academy ' model run along Australian lines , it 's much easier to find suitable individuals with a full sports program in every school . In the UK seventy per cent of state-school students are dropping PE when it becomes optional ; it is no surprise that up to 30 % of its Olympic athletes are now privately-educated , where physical education is compulsory until the end of one 's education . State education is not just about aiding the individual its also about the state getting a good return on its investment in a well-educated populace to drive business and entrepreneurialism etc . . This applies equally in sports . 	Compulsory physical education will improve national sporting achievement
Compulsory PE lessons can be treated in the same manner an ordinary educational class is treated ; if the student refuses to participate and therefore does not do their work , they are punished with extra work of that same class . In this case , that would necessitate added physical education exercises at a later date or immediately after the class . The excuse that the student does not wish to participate in the class should be seen as no different to if it were stated during a maths or English class , where it would not be accepted . The fact that physical education is qualitatively different to those classes is irrespective ; once deemed a compulsory subject , and therefore beneficial , it must be accepted and completed . 	Schools can punish students who do not participate in the classes with further PE lessons
Conflict needs to be regulated , and something that can start conflicts even more so . Warfare and conflict is currently regulated by the Geneva Conventions that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict and regulate the conduct of the involved actors . Just as importantly there are rules on what weapons can be used through various treaties that ban weapons such as the Land Mine Ban , and on when a state can legally initiate conflict through the UN Charter . In just the same way when a new area of potential conflict arises that too must be regulated by treaty . The internet and the threat of cyber-conflict is that new area at the moment . While cyber warfare is not currently a large scale threat it is still a form of conflict that could escalate just like any other - the Pentagon has explicitly stated it could respond militarily to a cyber-attack . As a result it is most sensible to draw up the rules and regulations early , to ensure everyone knows the consequences and prevent damage by making sure that states agree not to engage in offence cyber-attacks against each other . The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols , , 29 October 2010 , Convention on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction , , 18 September 1997 , Brookes , Adam , US Pentagon to treat cyber-attacks as acts of war , BBC News , 1 June 2011 , 	Arenas of potential conflict must be regulated
Ever since the state rose to ascendancy over powerful internal actors , such as the nobility in a feudal system , the state has had a monopoly on the use of force . The state quickly became the only institution with the resources to maintain military forces and has become the only legitimate wielder of force . The internet however changes this . Cyber-attacks are often by individuals or groups who can carry out a cross border attack without the aid of their home country . In 2011 CIA director Leon Panetta told Congress when it comes to national security , I think this represents the battleground for the future . I 've often said that I think the potential for the next Pearl Harbor could very well be a cyber-attack . If cyber-attacks are so important it stands to reason that the groups who are able to engage in such activities should be as limited as possible . While it is not always possible states try to make sure that the weapons of war for the most part remain in the hands of responsible actors . This should apply as much in cyberspace as elsewhere . While terrorist groups do exist and are occasionally armed by states for the most part they are seen by every government as being illegitimate . Serrano , Richard A. , U.S. intelligence officials concerned about cyber attack , , 11 February 2011 , 	The use of the internet undermines the state by demonopolizing the use of force
A treaty that bans , or sharply curtails cyber-attacks would benefit every state . Even those who may currently benefit from cyber espionage would be better off signing up to the treaty . First most cyber-attacks are not carried out by the state even in countries like China where the state is using the internet as an offensive tool . In its annual report to congress the Department of Defence stated some cyber-attacks appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military but this does not sound like a majority . Secondly no state wants a risk of conflict as a result of an unregulated new field of potential conflict . Or even to risk relations with other nations ; cyber-attacks in large part go on because they are cost free . And finally all nations are the victims of cyber-attacks . The United States has repeatedly condemned cyber-attacks against it but China also claims that it is the victim of cyber-attacks . Chinas Minister of National Defense General Chang Wanquan says China is one of the primary victims of hacker attacks in the world . Having a treaty against cyber attacks would not only make business easier for all countries but it would build up trust between nations where it is currently being eroded .

What cyber attack ? , , 19 August 2013 , 	A cyber treaty benefits everyone
Once a treaty is set up to limit or eliminate cyber-attacks monitoring is unlikely to be a problem because states will be willing to monitor each other . States in order to defend themselves from cyber-attacks already monitor the cyber-attacks that occur the United States for example already has several cyber defense forces . If that is not enough then there are numerous private groups that will be monitoring cyber-attacks as most are made against corporate rather than government targets . For example private company Mandiant exposed a unit of the Peoples Liberation Army for its cyber-attacks in February 2013 . Once a cyber-attack has been traced and evidence gathered if the appropriate domestic authorities wont deal with the culprit then an independent international institution can decide on the punishment for the government that is not living up to its treaty commitments . If there is a need for international monitoring rather than simply a dispute settlement mechanism then there are models available through current treaties ; a UN organisation similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency or International Criminal Court could be set up that can investigate incidents when asked .

State education in some areas of the UK is continuing to fail , despite increased investment . This will allow those pupils who are currently locked into sub-standard state education access to the private schools enjoyed by their more privileged peers -LRB- because you can spend the vouchers anywhere -RRB- . Even if private school fees can only be subsidised by the voucher scheme , most private schools are charitable organisations that do not run a profit , and so in the vast majority of circumstances the voucher will make private schools accessible to poorer families . 	Equality of opportunity between richer and poorer children
State schools will , like the private schools , have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere . This incentivises in particular high level management , who , if the school fails , will be out of a job with a blot on their record . 	Improving the quality of state managed education
Different parents have different values and priorities , and it is entirely legitimate for them to wish to pass these on to their children . The state does not know any better than them with which values the ideal life can be lived . Further , children are individuals who respond in very different ways to different styles of teaching . Parents know their children better than central government possibly could , and so are the best placed to decide what sort of school their child should go to . Currently , there is very little state provision for non-mainstream styles of learning , whereas in the private sector there is a big incentive for educational innovation . 	Increasing parents ' freedom of choice
Other civic duties also exist which are recognised as necessary in order to live in a better , more cohesive , stable society like paying taxes , attending school , obeying road rules and , in some countries , military conscription and jury duty . All of these obligatory activities require far more time and effort than voting does , thus compulsory voting can be seen as constituting a much smaller intrusion of freedom than any of these other activities . . In the last century alone the soldiers of numerous warsand the suffragettes of many countries fought and died for enfranchisement . It is our duty to respect their sacrifice by voting . 1 . , 2006 	Voting is a civic duty
Australia is one of the most notable examples of compulsory voting and shows how it can be implemented . In Australia Compulsory voting was introduced at federal elections in 1924 . Every Australian citizen who is over eighteen has to vote unless they have a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote which is decided by the electoral commission whether a reason is sufficient . If the elector who fails to vote does not provide such a reason they pay a penalty and if -LRB- s -RRB- he does not pay then the matter is dealt with in court . There is little reason to believe that this would be more difficult to implement in any other country . , Australian Electoral Commission , 2010 	Compulsory voting has been implemented successfully .
A benefit of compulsory voting is that it makes it more difficult for special interest groups to vote themselves into power . Under a non-compulsory voting system , if fewer people vote then it is easier for smaller sectional interests and lobby groups to control the outcome of the political process . A notable example would be the disproportionate influence of agriculture in policy making as seen in both European politics and well as American with enormous amounts of subsidies for farmers who represent a minute percentage of the population . The outcome of the election therefore reflects less the will of the people -LRB- Who do I want to lead the country ? -RRB- but instead reflects who was logistically more organized and more able to convince people to take time out of their day to cast a vote -LRB- Do I even want to vote today ? -RRB- . 	It will reduce the power of special interest groups
Voter apathy is highest among the poorest and most excluded sectors of society . As the highlight , the higher the income a citizen enjoys , and the higher the educational qualifications attained , the more likely it is that he or she will turn out to vote . which leads to a vicious circle of increasing isolation . By making the most disenfranchised vote the major political parties are forced to take notice of them and this would reduce political polarisation . Compulsory voting ensures that all stakeholders in society are proportionally considered in governmental policy . 	Compulsory voting broadens representation of disadvantaged groups
Compulsory voting increases the number of people who cast their vote . People who know they will have to vote will take politics more seriously and start to take a more active role . Compulsory voting will potentially encourage voters to research the candidates ' political positions more thoroughly . This may force candidates to be more open and transparent about their positions on many complex and controversial issues . Citizens will be willing to inform themselves even about unpopular policies and burning issues that need to be tackled . This means that such a system could produce better political decisions that are not contradicting each other , quite upon the contrary . 	It will cause more people to become interested in politics
To pay for his government programs , Obama supports a progressive tax system , with higher taxes for the rich , and lower taxes for the middle class . The need for such a system of taxing the rich to pay for government services has grown since 1980 , when income gains between the rich and the poor began to diverge at a faster pace . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Recent data shows this trend continuing : in 2011 the wealthiest Americans got richer while median income fell by 4 % . -LSB- 2 -RSB- Despite these trends , the top marginal tax rate is at nearly an all-time low ! -LSB- 3 -RSB- Increasing tax on individuals who earn more than $ 250,000 and even more for multi-millionaires because the marginal utility of wealth is lower for the super-rich than it is for the poorer . In other words , a millionaire is not particularly worse off if he or she is worth $ 10 million instead of $ 15 million . $ 5 million when spent on welfare programs such as pensions , education , healthcare or housing produces vastly greater utility . We thus see how a progressive tax system ensures a more efficient management of wealth across the economy . Obama proposes to rake in more government revenue by raising the top marginal tax rate and instituting the Buffet Rule -LRB- a stipulation in President Obamas plan which would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 % to individuals making over $ 1 million per year -RRB- . Crucially , Obama plans to continue to cut taxes for the middle classes in order to increase their purchasing power and stimulate the economy . -LSB- 5 -RSB- As the 2012 presidential election approaches , President Obamas long-term focus has been primarily on decreasing the federal debt , estimated at about $ 15 trillion . Specifically , Obamas plan , detailed on his website , targets tax loopholes for households with annual incomes over $ 250,000 , via efforts such as the Buffet Rule , while simultaneously reducing taxes for middle-class families and small business owners . -LSB- 6 -RSB- In September , President Obama revealed a plan to reduce the deficit by about $ 3.2 trillion in the next ten years . -LSB- 7 -RSB- This will be achieved through an increase in taxation of the nations wealthiest , and cuts in spending to the armed forces as Obama plans to end American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities : A Guide to Statistics on Historical Trends in Income Inequality , March 5 2012 , -LSB- 2 -RSB- Nocera , Joe : Romney and the Forbes 400 , The New York Times , September 24 2012 , -LSB- 3 -RSB- Tax Policy Centre , , accessed 8/10/2012 -LSB- 4 -RSB- , accessed 8/10/2012 -LSB- 5 -RSB- Politifact : Barack Obama said hes cut taxes for middle-class families , small businesses , , accessed 8/10/2012 -LSB- 6 -RSB- Barack Obama Website , , accessed 8/10/2012 -LSB- 7 -RSB- The White House , , accessed 8/10/2012 	A progressive tax policy and a cut in military spending are what America needs .
President Obama believes in an activist governments role in improving society . Without public intervention , private markets will not sufficiently address inequality or several other public needs , such as environmental preservation and public transportation . Financial returns from investments in such areas are often insufficient to incentivise private sector investment . However such schemes generate high levels of welfare benefits that are desirable from a societal perspective . Obamas economic policy draws on Keynesian economic theory , which is the belief that a mixed economy of public and private enterprise , bolstered by a strong welfare state , can jumpstart the economy . In order to create public enterprise , the government needs to spend , either by building a deficit or from tax revenue . -LSB- 1 -RSB- This is the policy he has pursued in his first term with a successful stimulus of $ 787 billion . -LSB- 2 -RSB- Obamas tax policy boils down to the empirical belief that taxing the rich will help the economy grow , because the revenue can be used on important government programs that can spur growth , and the philosophical argument that the American economy should be more equal and that the U.S. government can and should do more to directly address inequality . It should therefore not be a surprise that Obama wants the Bush era tax cuts for the richest reversed arguing `` I just believe that anybody making over $ 250,000 should go back to the income tax rates we were paying under Bill Clinton .

Advertising serves an important purpose by informing the public about a specific product . It is also regulated from manipulation , and therefore deserves no special restrictions ; these same restrictions and watchdogs would be in place if advertising of drugs were allowed to make sure that no drug is misrepresented . We trust consumers to view adverts with a level of skepticism and we know that they form only one part of the research that goes into , say , buying a car . Drug companies have become more open in recent years . For instance , GSK now publishes the results of all their drug trials -LRB- including the ones that fail -RRB- online and there are plenty of other sources of information on drugs available . A drug that remains unused is a drug that is helping nobody ; adverts are simply a reasonable way for drug companies to help consumers find out about their products within a safe and highly regulated environment . When the first discussion in the European Parliament was started , regarding the advertisement of pharmaceuticals , the pharmaceutical industry specifically pointed out the anomaly that exists : Specific laws stood in the way of it communicating with patients over its products , even when others could . Presumably , this meant information was communicated by the media about new medicines . In this regard , the restrictions on the pharma industry contrast with the freedom enjoyed by manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies , who routinely advertise products to patients . This shows that it is unjust to make any differences between the companies . 	Advertisements for prescription drugs are not significantly different from any other advertisement
Advertising increases consumer awareness of drugs , which makes consumers more likely to take appropriate medication . The drugs market is complex and so advertising can help explain the differences between treatments , for example between contraceptive pills intended to reduce period pain , period flow and those simply to prevent pregnancy . Advertising under current rules is used to inform patients of new drugs which may be appropriate for conditions which they suffer from -LRB- such as recent asthma drugs which reduce the frequency of attacks -RRB- , but which their doctor might overlook or not have the time to crosscheck against her list of patients . 56 % of AMA general practitioners believed that direct-to-consumer advertising had prompted some of their patients to seek treatment for a condition which would have otherwise been neglected . If a patient has taken the time to actively consider a particular drug and then visits their doctor , whether they are prescribed it or not , they are building up a positive relationship with their doctor and are more likely to continue to take an active interest in their health . Further on , in states where there is no direct to consumer advertising but there is advertising to doctors , patients are disadvantaged because it is in the interest for private medical insurance firms or national health services to keep information about expensive new drugs from patients . In the UK it was because of cost that the Primary Care Trusts -LRB- PCTs -RRB- refused to allow the prescription of Herceptin , a drug which US studies have shown reduces the damage done by breast cancer . Ultimately pressure from Roche , the drugs manufacturer and from patients resulted in the drug being authorized for use , but the process was much faster in the US where Roche could run advertisements alerting consumers to the potential benefits of Herceptin , and thereby immediately giving patients access to a similar level of information as their doctors and allowing them to push for its authorization . 	Patients will be better informed than under the status quo
Advertisementsespecially those that identify symptomscan lead to a healthier citizenry , as consumers become aware of their diseases earlier , and can thus find the drug that targets their problem at an earlier stage . Many drugs can prevent or reduce the likelihood of a patient requiring surgery -LRB- for instance anti-cholesterol drugs can reduce the buildup of atheroma in blood vessels , which cause cardiovascular heart disease and strokes , thus reducing the likelihood of a heart bypass being required and improving any post-stroke rehabilitation -RRB- . This not only saves money but is also better for patients . Surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation . Also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention ; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them , thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers . 	Advertising will enable patients to get better treatment earlier in their illnesses
We should not attack drugs companies for making profits from their products , nor for encouraging patients to use them . Each new drug costs an average of $ 500m to produce and very small percentage of the drugs that are researched ever make it to the market . The more profitable the industry , the more new drugs it can afford to research and develop and thus the more patients who can receive appropriate treatment . Many of the complex cures being developed for diseases like cancer , HIV/AIDs , SARS and Avian Flu will take decades to research . In the meantime , drug companies require funding streams from other drugs to continue research . Drugs have become increasingly expensive and advertisement helps to cover those costs . From 1980 and 2004 , from about $ 6 billion -LRB- in 2005 dollars -RRB- to $ 39 billion . There has been a real growth rate of about 8 percent a year , on average . By comparison , drug firms gross marginssales revenue minus costs and income taxeshave been increasing more slowly , by about 4 percent annually . So , with more personalized medicine and greater costs in drug development , the industry needs a greater source of revenue in order to research therapeutics further . Advertising would provide this revenue . 	Adverts generate profit . Profit funds research into improved drugs
One of the purposes of government is identify possible threats to health and protect the people from these threats . The fact that some government regulations seem ` silly ' or misplaced , or can not easily be understood by lay-people is not a compelling argument for having no regulations at all , or for not having regulations in the case of trans fat . The commentators who denounce the ` nanny state ' do not indicate what , if any , regulations or styles of regulation they approve of . Do they think there should be no inspections of restaurants by health inspectors ? No regulation at all of food or drug safety by the Food and Drug Administration ? Some commentators think that people should be encouraged to study the dangers of trans fats and make their own judgements about what to eat . But people have limited time to do research on such matters . It makes sense to delegate the research to a central authority , so that instead of 300 million people trying to learn about trans fats and every other lurking menace , a handful of experts can make recommendations based on the likely responses and desires of the average , informed citizen . Non-specialists capacity to absorb information on complex chemical and biological subjects is quite limited . The majority of us are reliant on the research of others for most of what we know . -LRB- 5 -RRB- The opinion of the experts on the dangers of trans fats is conclusive : trans fats are unsafe . The American Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- considers all uses of trans fats to be ` generally regarded as safe . ' This allows the use of trans fats in whatever way food producers desire . Safe for the FDA means ' a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under its intended conditions of use ' , which no longer applies to trans fats . This ` generally regarded as safe ' status should be revoked which in turn would greatly restrict its use in food . The other option would be to allow local jurisdictions to regulate trans fats , but this would be more costly and lead to a patchwork of regulations . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The most effective method of controlling the use of trans-fats is through centralised , nationally applicable policy making . The poor and young are particularly vulnerable to the negative health effects of trans fats ; at the very least , the threat posed to these groups justifies the use of informed regulation . Professor Alan Maryon-Davis , president of the UK Faculty of Public Health said in 2010 : `` There are great differences in the amount of trans-fats consumed by different people and we are particularly concerned about young people and those with little disposable income who eat a lot of this type of food . This is a major health inequalities issue . -LRB- 6 -RRB- The government has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from harms that they are not best placed to understand or avoid themselves , and so a ban on trans fats would not only save lives but would also be legitimate under the government 's role to protect when citizens can not reasonably protect themselves . 	The state should ban trans fats to protect the public
It is easy and inexpensive to replace trans fats with other , less harmful products without significantly altering the taste of the food . Kraft eliminated trans fats from its Oreo cookies , with little public perception of any change in taste . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Similarly , the Wendy 's restaurant chain tested a new frying oil in 370 franchises , with customers not noticing a difference in taste . Denmark imposed a national ban on trans fats with which even McDonald 's has complied . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Replacements for trans fats will get cheaper and cheaper with time , as they are used more frequently and as the companies that produce and distribute them increase their sales volumes and are able to sell them for lower prices . Since trans fats are not irreplaceable , objections for the sake of consumer freedom are also unconvincing . As with lead added to paint , trans fats are unnecessary additions to products that can cause significant harm . Most people remain ignorant of the presence of trans-fats in their food , and of their effects . In this area the ban on trans fats differs from restrictions placed on the sale of alcohol and tobacco and so the two kinds of bans are not comparable . Not only are trans fats easy to substitute in foodstuffs , without impairing quality or taste , the presence of trans-fats is hard to detect . It is all-but impossible for informed and conscientious consumers to avoid buying and eating trans-fats . While banning cigarettes and alcohol mean banning an entire product category , banning the ingredient of trans fats means no such thing . Rather , it simply means that readily available replacement ingredients must be used in the preparation of the same foods . And , since these fatty replacements are widespread and cheaply available , food makers and consumers should have little difficulty making the adjustment to making and consuming the same , albeit slightly modified , foods . 	Healthier equivalents of trans fats exist
Trans fats , which are chemically engineered , decrease levels of desirable cholesterol while increasing harmful cholesterol ; they increase dangerous inflammation that can contribute to the onset of diabetes ; and they harden artery walls , which increases blood pressure . Trans fats are much worse than even naturally occurring , and still very unhealthy , saturated fats such as those found in butter . Dariush Mozaffarian , a Harvard cardiologist and epidemiologist , calculated that up to 22 percent of heart attacks in the United States are the result of trans fat consumption . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Banning trans fats would therefore mean saving thousands of lives and improving the general health of hundreds of thousands of individuals . In England , for example , a 1 per cent reduction in the use of trans fats , as a proportion of total daily calories , would prevent an estimated 11,000 heart attacks saving 7,000 lives a year . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Consumption of trans fats in developed nations ranges from 2-4 per cent of total calorie intake , so it is a huge factor in many countries . -LRB- 2 -RRB- In New York , voluntary efforts to reduce their use by restaurants and retailers failed , However the 2007 ban caused reasturants to stop using trans fats with the proportion of New York restaurants using them falling from 50 per cent to less than 2 per cent . -LRB- 2 -RRB- There were fears that trans fats would be replaced with saturated animal fat , but this has not been the case . Writing in the British Medical Journal , Dariush Mozaffarian , assistant professor of medicine , and Meir Stampfer , professor of epidemiology at Harvard , say removing industrial trans fats is ` one of the most straightforward public health strategies for rapid improvements in health . ' A ban would save lives , be easy to implement yet have no impact on the price , sales , taste or availability of the affected foods . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Moreover , no amount of trans fats is healthy , unlike other fats . As Catherine Winters argues , while we know what a healthy level of saturated fat is -LRB- 10 percent or less of your daily calories -RRB- , no one knows what a healthy level would be for trans fatty acids . '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- `` Eating foods that contain trans fatty acids is like riding in a car without using a seat belt , '' says Michael F. Jacobson , PhD , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest -LRB- CSPI -RRB- , a Washington , D.C.-based consumer advocacy organization concerned with health and nutrition issues . -LRB- 3 -RRB- A study published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also suggests that trans fats may increase a woman 's risk of fertility problems by 70 percent . Women who received 2 percent of their daily calories from trans fats , were 70 to 100 percent more likely to suffer infertility due to lack of ovulation . For someone with a 2,000 calorie diet , this level of intake could be achieved by consuming just 4 grams of trans fats a day , an amount that could be found in a single doughnut or portion of french fries . ` It 's really a small amount of fats that we observed having a significant effect on infertility , ' said lead researcher Dr. Jorge Chavarro . '' -LRB- 4 -RRB- By contrast to natural fats , trans fats are entirely synthetic , and pose a significantly greater risk to individuals long term health than natural saturated fats . For this reason , it is reasonable to consider banning them . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Bans should be reserved for very serious health crises . The infertility , obesity , heart attacks , and death caused by the presence of trans fats in diets is such a crisis . A ban is , thus , an appropriate regulatory response . 	Trans fats are uniquely unhealthy
The increased use of DNA evidence will minimize the risk of future wrongful convictions . An FBI study indicates that since 1989 DNA evidence has excluded the primary candidate in 25 % of sexual assault cases . This not only saves valuable police time , but ensures suspects are not called in for unnecessary and stressful questioning . Moreover , forensically valuable DNA can be found on evidence that has existed for decades , and thus assist in reversing previous miscarriages of justice . There have been a number of recent , high-profile cases of death row inmates being released on the grounds of DNA evidence , unavailable when they were first convicted . A DNA database would not merely render wrong verdicts right , but prevent such verdicts ever being made . 	DNA evidence would reduce the risk of wrongful conviction
A DNA database is not intended to replace conventional criminal investigation . The database ought to identify the potential suspects , each of whom can then be investigated by more conventional means . During 2008/09 in the United Kingdom , ` almost 6 in 10 crime scene profiles loaded to the National DNA Database were matched to a subject profile ' . There is no possibility of escaping the provision of technical evidence before a court . Doctors , ballistics experts , forensic scientists are already a common feature of the large criminal trial . The jury system is actually a bastion against conviction on account of complicated scientific facts . The British jury is instructed to acquit a defendant where they find reasonable doubt . If the genetic data and associated evidence is insufficiently conclusive , or presented without sufficient clarity , the jury is obliged to find the defendant not guilty . 	A DNA database would reduce the time spent tracking down suspects
Although overall levels of crime in England and Wales have decreased over the previous decade , the number of violent crimes against the person has markedly increased . These are the offences which raise most grave public concern and which are unlikely to leave conventional fingerprints . The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence estimates that thirty per cent of crime scenes contain the blood , semen , or saliva of the perpetrator . DNA detection will be best equipped to identify the guilty . A full database ought to allow the use of DNA as an investigative tool where no suspect has yet been identified . Studies support this assertion ; ` the overall detection rate for crimes of 23.5 % rises to 38 % where DNA is successfully recovered ' . Furthermore , in the United States , the number of reported rapes dropped to its lowest level in two decades due in large part to the use of DNA evidence 	A DNA database would lead to more convictions , particularly in cases of violent crime
Biological parenthood does matter to a childs welfare and the court must therefore take this into account : people care about their biological heritage . Every child has the right to a natural biological heritage . * The desire to understand their biological heritage is evident from the large number of adopted children who register to find their natural parents . There are a number of reasons for this . It can be important for the development of a personal identity to have a sense of ones heritage , particularly if ones ancestors originated from a different part of the world with a different culture or set of traditions . People like to see themselves as part of something more important than merely their own existence and having a sense of the history of their ancestors assists this understanding . Given this , it is particularly important for the development of the childs identity that they have some form of contact with their biological parents . * The rights of Children and The Redefinition of Parenthood David Blankenhorn , Presentation at the Danish Institute for Human Rights -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 	Biological heritage is important for children .
Even in the unlikely case where it could be shown that equality of parenthood would be assisted , it is unfair on those children who lose out on the opportunity to develop contact with their biological parents as a result of the policy . There is no evidence to suggest that children will stop wanting to feel part of a longer chain of people or to know something about the history of their ancestors . It has been established that it may be in a childs interests to maintain contact with a biological parent , even where all other factors militate against this . * It is unfair on these children to use them as social battering rams . Furthermore , the unfairness would be compounded in those states where biological fathers are forced to pay towards the childs maintenance if the biological link was used in this context but not in establishing contact . * Father Absence and the Welfare of Children , Network on the Family and the Economy 	It would be unfair for children to lose out on the opportunity to develop contact with a biological parent .
The enormous investment of time and effort of biological parents should not be underestimated . Or undervalued . In particular the role of surrogate mothers is a hugely significant one would not be weighted in a social construction of parenthood . * Yet it is a great emotional and physical sacrifice that should be recognised in these decisions as they are very significant part of a childs life . * Family , Ancestry and Self : What is the Moral Significance of Biological Ties ? 	It is unreasonable to ignore the importance of the biological link to a child .
The best academic departments are ones run with purely academic aims . Intensive study of a field requires that you are given the resources , support , time and space that you need . Moreover , the best atmosphere is one in which everyone around you shares your love of study . It follows that departments should be allowed to use this as their top priority . This affects undergraduate study in two ways : students must be free to spend time getting to grips with their subject properly , and lecturers must be allowed to teach the things they feel to be most important for their subject . Neither of these things are possible when you are worrying about jobs . Every subject has certain parts which are more or less relevant to their related careers , but this may not be the same as the parts which are important to academic study of the subject . For example , maths students will invariably be taught Linear Algebra and Group Theory , normally in the first year , but 20 % of Mathematics graduates work in Business & Finance , where this is not relevant . If everyone is expected to have one eye on vocational training the academic study will necessarily suffer . Solving this problem requires that we split vocational and academic study , so that people doing one dont need to worry about the other . This will improve each of them . 	Academia must be free of distractions
The courses which are generally offered at the moment are not serving students well when it comes to providing the skills for employment . 65 % of businesses complain of being unable to hire people with the right skills . Increasingly , universities are offering as a selling point the fact that they have extra-curricular courses to teach people business skills , but this is a tacit admission that they are selling people degrees which are not fit for purpose . Solving this requires us to teach more vocationally . There are schemes underway in many areas to do just that to give one example , in Maine , USA , a bill has been passed to improve local colleges . Our policy moves these efforts from the fringes to the core of the system : isolate as far as possible the specific things which make good employees and teach those to people . This will help them get jobs more easily , and also ensure that companies are able to operate effectively . The consequences of such a policy would be good all round . 	Vocational courses produce better employees
Universities can not take every student who applies . They have to balance the number of applications they get with both the number of teaching staff they have and the time they need for research . In the UK , almost a third of applicants do not get places as it is , and those that do often find they have less contact time with staff than they had expected . Simply put , if you want to have academics doing useful research , you cant expect them to teach all the time . If universities have a finite number of places , it makes sense that they should be allocated to the people best suited for them . Currently , universities are so overwhelmed by demand that it isnt possible for them to test this properly in most cases , they will take a cursory look at predicted grades , and perhaps an interview with the candidate . Discouraging applicants would lower the stress on admissions departments , making the process more accurate . It will also allow them more leisure to reach out to and target students with the right personality , improving the quality of applications . Forget all of the discussion as to whether or not academic courses are useful its simply not practical to have everyone do them . 	Universities dont have unlimited places available
Not everyone should be spending their time in academic study . As well as requiring certain skills , it also requires that the personality of the student be suited to it . They must be capable of manufacturing a sustained interest in a subject , or they will not be able to drag themselves through three or more years of thinking about little else . Some people are , by nature , not that kind of person they may think in a short-term way or simply not be curious about the world . It also requires a level of intelligence which some people simply dont have . These people will gain very little from spending time at university . In fact , at some -LRB- typically less prestigious -RRB- universities , dropout rates can be as high as 20 % , meaning students will literally gain nothing . Many people are putting themselves through university despite it not being right for them . Partial blame for this lies with employers the large number of graduates means a culture has developed among recruiters of using the presence or absence of a degree as a default filter for applicants ; 78 % of leading employers filter out anyone with less than a 2:1 . We should discourage this . By implementing this policy , we create a different and better way to measure someones employability . This will make employers more likely to hire these people , and allow them to follow a path through life better suited to their personality . 	Students are forcing themselves through university even when it is not right for them
A high number of students failing to succeed in languages is not a valid reason to make the subject optional . This mentality opens the gate to making English and math options , simply to eradicate the effort of improving pass rates . The British Broadcasting Corporation -LRB- BBC -RRB- reports that in the UK A quarter of secondary pupils -LRB- aged 11 and over -RRB- fail to reach their potential in math -LRB- s -RRB- and a quarter are making insufficient progress in English . Still , optional English and math is unthinkable ; these are core subjects - languages should also be considered as such . Those who want to transfer students energies from foreign languages to English are ignoring the possibility that learning a foreign language may actually be useful for learning the first language . Students failing in core subjects must be helped to improve , not have the subject eradicated . 	Language acquisition is no less vital than competence in mathematics and english
The problems students face when learning languages are the fault of teaching methods , not language ability . Madeline Ehrman observes that the root of this problem is that the student is out of sync with the methodology , the teacher . Therefore , the antidote is more modern learning styles ; there are some quick fixes that can be made when adaptations are needed . Languages should not be abandoned when students find them boring rather the curriculum and methods of teaching need to be changed to make the learning more interesting and more relevant . For example students struggle even with their own grammar so an emphasis on making themselves understood rather than correct grammar may be more useful . 	The solution is more teaching of languages not less .
Languages are extremely beneficial to the economy in two senses . Firstly , language skills improve a job candidates chances of selection , which keeps unemployment down . The National Centre for Languages -LRB- CILT -RRB- reports on its website that 36 % of employers recruit people with languages , 49 % of employers are dissatisfied with school leavers language skills and that 95 % of London employers think that language skills are important for the London economy . Secondly , a high number of employees with language skills enhance companies abilities to engage in trade and to expand their business abroad , in turn enhancing exports . 	Workers with advanced language skills increase the competitiveness of the economies they participate in
The call for students to learn a foreign language not only stems from economic needs but also from the need of improved security and diplomacy , in particular a better understanding of cultures and languages in order to better understand threats to the state and improved foreign services are needed . In many Anglophone countries even in the role of a diplomat there are worrying numbers who do not have the language skills they need , for example in Canada only 16 % of the 180 foreign service officers who were required to have advanced foreign languages skills for their positions , could speak the needed language . As a 2007 National Academy of sciences report warns us the pervasive lack of knowledge of foreign languages and cultures threatens the security of the united states as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an unformed citizenry . Since the increased security post 9/11 the government accountability office -LRB- GAO -RRB- have reported that there are a shortage of foreign language expertise within the government and for this reason may undermine national security . Much of the population of mainland Europe go to great lengths to learn foreign languages , especially the dominant English . English speakers should reciprocate the efforts made by their foreign counterparts ; Nicolas Sarkozy for example is aiming to make France into a bilingual nation . Across Europe at least 20 % of third-level students claim to be proficient in at least two foreign languages . However , in countries where English is a major language , this is not the case ; in Ireland , for example the figure is only 5 % . In the United States the situation is similar only 31 % of US elementary schools and 24 % of public schools teach foreign languages . Expecting foreign countries to communicate through dominant English is a lazy and arrogant attitude to language and should not be permitted . Therefore learning languages up to the age of sixteen should be compulsory . 	Learning a language is a sign of good diplomacy .
To refuse to learn foreign languages is narrow-minded , ignorant and blinkered . Language is a means not only of asserting identity but , more importantly of heritage culture maintenance . To refuse to learn a foreign language is to disallow anyones culture apart from ones own to be upheld . When this happens , the dominant groups force ethnic groups into particular niches . This is particularly likely to be a problem in multicultural societies or indeed any society that is not homogeneous . By refusing to learn foreign languages , one refuses to recognise that other cultures even exist . For this reason learning a foreign language helps to tackle xenophobia . Negative stereotyping is sadly still prevalent in the modern world . American students in Maine view persons speaking standard French as shorter , less leaderlike -LRB- sic -RRB- , less thoughtful , less intelligent , less honest , less self-confident , less dependable , less generous , less kind , less ambitious , less stable and with less character than English Speakers . Such stereotypes lead to prejudices , xenophobia and , in extreme cases , hate crime . Learning foreign languages is a good way to combat such prejudices , because the students learn about the foreign culture for themselves , meet and converse with its people , and have a first-hand introduction to a foreign people . This will leave them more open minded towards other cultures so less likely to be xenophobic towards other cultures whose language they have not learnt . As Reynolds explains , discounting stereotypes involves denying cultural differences such as the ability to communicate through the same language . 	Learning languages promotes understanding of other cultures
Students should have a fundamental freedom of choice when it comes to all but the most necessary subjects . If students want to specialise in for example Science and drop foreign languages in order to be able to do this then they should have this option , a choice which is likely to be beneficial for their chosen career . Students progress in their most successful subjects should not be hindered by the burden of language learning . It is not the case that students do not desire to engage in languages because they are lazy , narrow-minded or blinkered . Rather , because they demonstrate real strength in other subjects they do not wish to be constrained in those subjects by ones where they do not excel . A standard complaint is quoted by Ehrman ; -LRB- learning languages -RRB- affects -LRB- all study -RRB- a lot ! Im finding it just depressing to have to study , when my only reason for being here is to meet a requirementit really annoys me to have to waste my time on this , when I could be learning something Ill use after graduationThe pressures just too much for me ! Students should be allowed and encouraged to channel all their energy and enthusiasm into the subjects they are best at and most enthusiastic towards . 	Students should be free to choose to play to their strengths .
Examining the use of American military power following the end of the Cold War shows us that the United States has pursued an agenda of tackling serious threats to international peace , security and prosperitywhether they emanate from rogue states and sponsors of terrorism , oppressive dictators , or war criminals . Humanitarian interventions in Yugoslavia , Iraq , Afghanistan and most recently Libya highlight the importance of these considerations to Americas military strategy , and the willingness of the US to put aside narrow geopolitical interests in order to pursue humanitarian goals , to the benefit of much of the world . -LSB- 10 -RSB- Americas military dominance and command of the commons -LRB- sea , space and air -RRB- has also allowed it to provide global collective goods and to maintain an open international order , which is vital to international prosperity . -LSB- 11 -RSB- -LSB- 10 -RSB- Rieff , David -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , Liberal Imperialism , in Andrew Bacevich -LRB- ed . -RRB- , , -LRB- Chicago , 2003 -RRB- -LSB- 11 -RSB- Posen , Barry R.

Where the US has used military force , it has largely done it to uphold human rights and international peace , security and prosperity .
As Robert Cox argues , American hegemony has been successful because the US has been able to maintain its dominance through a high level of global consensus by establishing a broadly accepted rules-based liberal international economic order , and has been able to shape other states preferences in a manner that has awarded sufficient benefits to these states while ensuring the dominance of the US . -LSB- 1 -RSB- This has been what John Ikenberry terms Americas liberal grand strategy , * which has enabled the US to construct a relatively benign and highly institutionalized multilateral system based on open markets , free trade , and the provision of public goods , such as collective security and an open international trading regime . -LSB- 2 -RSB- This has allowed other countries to prosper economically and also in terms of their security ; the rebuilding and success of Japan and Germany provides important examples of this . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Cox , Robert .

The US used its power to establish a set of open global institutions which have been broadly beneficial .
Americas hegemonic power has enabled it to provide global leadership on important international concerns . Because the US is affected by the same problems as many other countries in an increasingly inter-connected world -LRB- for example climate change , terrorism , epidemics , oil crises , economic recessions , the illegal drugs trade , and nuclear proliferation -RRB- it is in its interests to promote policies that are broadly globally beneficial . The US is able to utilize its considerable economic and diplomatic clout to convince its allies to back important multilateral international initiatives . One example of this was George W. Bushs initiative on HIV/AIDS in the developing world . The United States has also used its power to unify the global effort against terrorism and provide collective security and considerable aid to various nations , as well as leading the international effort to prevent failed or weak states -LRB- such as Somalia and Yemen -RRB- falling into the hands of terrorists . 	The US has provided global leadership in tackling important issues such as terrorism .
An important part of the liberal international order the US maintains is that power is diffused and is based on negotiation , strategic bargaining and the exercise of power through mutually-agreed rules and institutions . Globalization and the liberalization of the global economy has been actively supported by many nations in the world , some of whomsuch as China , Japan , and Germanyhave even used it to compete economically with the United States . Other states have also enjoyed significant decision-making powers in international institutions . For example , the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- decisions are made on the basis of a one country , one vote system . -LSB- 4 -RSB- This consensus-based exercise of power has provided the US with a relatively large degree of legitimacy in world opinion , often outstripping the global approval ratings of other major powers . -LSB- 5 -RSB- -LSB- 4 -RSB- Ikenberry , G.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the victory of liberal democracy over communism have provided the US with more impetus to actively promote democracy , human rights and international norms and law . Under President Clinton , the Leahy Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act of 1998 and the Religious Persecution Act of the same year demonstrated this change in priorities . Democracy promotion also became a core element of George W. Bushs National Security Strategy of 2002 , and has been a key motivating factor in President Obamas response to the Arab Spring , where the US has supported democratic forces against dictators such as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya . The US under Obama has also provided leadership in the UN Human Rights Council -LSB- 12 -RSB- , and holds governments to account through The Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights and Labour -LRB- DRL -RRB- , which also forges and maintains global partnerships to promote human rights and democracy . -LSB- 13 -RSB- -LSB- 12 -RSB- Brookings , U.S .

If an age group is protected , that results in a better health conditions for the whole society . In an industrialized country such as the USA , those choosing exemption from statutorily compulsory vaccination were 35-times more likely to contract measles than vaccinated persons ; in developing countries where these viruses are still endemic , the risk would be considerably higher . Those who wish to opt-out of vaccination -LRB- often on behalf of their children , who have no say in the matter -RRB- are classic free riders , hoping to benefit from the more responsible behavior of the rest of society . As it is assumed that most of society see it as a responsibility and a duty to protect others . After a scare about possible side effects of the MMR jab , in 2008 there was a drop in voluntary vaccinations in a part of London -LRB- Lewisham -RRB- . In that part of London only 64.3 % of children were vaccine and in that year the district accounted one third of all south-east London measles cases . Unless there is a 95 % vaccination , there is a great threat to public health of infection outbreaks . It is therefore the role of the state to understand these issues and possible treats and provide a duty of protection and care , in this case , in the form of immunization . Another example of the need to protect is also given by the example of voluntary vaccination against the flu , because of its impacts on the whole population is given by Pediatric studies : In several studies , results indicated that a 100 % vaccination rate among health care personnel in acute care settings triggered a 43 % decline in risk of influenza among patients . This decrease appeared even higher 60 % among nursing home patients . So by giving up some of the individuals freedoms and the feeling of duty to protection , the community is much more protected and benefits from the vaccination of the community . 	It is the states duty to protect its community
Commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health , compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease . In the U.S. during the year 2001 , routine childhood immunizations against seven diseases were estimated to save over $ 40 billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $ 10 billion in direct health costs , and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5 billion . Another aspect is also , that productivity rates remain high and less money is earmarked for social and health transfers because people are healthier . This is also supported by a WHO study , that claims : We calculate that the average percentage increase in income for the children whose immunization coverage increases through will rise from 0.78 per cent in 2005 to 2.39 per cent by 2020 . This equates to an increase in annual earnings per child of $ 14 by 2020 . The total increase in income per year once the vaccinated cohort of children start earning will rise from $ 410 million in 2005 to $ 1.34 billion by 2020 -LRB- at a cost of $ 638 million in 2005 and $ 748 million in 2020 -RRB- . This study based on economic and health indicators is part of the world immunization program GAVI . 	Compulsory vaccines are a financial relief on the health system
As article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states , State parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to health services . Each year millions of children worldwide die of preventable diseases before the age of five . The argument presented here is that the state needs to protect the child and immunize him or her from preventable diseases as obviously the child does not have the capabilities at this stage to make informed decisions of their own . The United Nations Right to Liberty and Security of the Person treaty , article 6.2 supports this view - State Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child . It is up to the State to decide if a child is to be immunized , as overall it will be the State who would benefit from having the vast majority of its citizens vaccinated , and it will be the State who will have to pay for any treatment needed to treat a preventable disease . Whilst a childs parents have to a certain degree the right to decide what is best for their childs future , poor decision making in this area could result in serious medical issues for the nation . In this extremely important area , the State must have authority over the rights of the parent . 	Duty to protect the child
People might do things online that can have negative consequences for their career . Think of whistleblowers for example : whistleblowers are employees of a company that have direct and first-hand knowledge of their employer doing something illegal or immoral . If they speak out about it publicly , they might lose their job and therefore their sole source of income . Allowing them to speak out anonymously enables them to invite public scrutiny to their employer without fear of getting fired . Or think of employers using social media in the job application process . Some people during adolescence -LRB- or in their student years -RRB- might misbehave where misbehaving can be something as relatively harmless as drinking a bit too much , then doing something silly and then having pictures of that end up on Facebook . Because Facebook doesnt allow anonymity , this means future employers can easily trace someones adolescent shenanigans to a person they are currently considering to hire . Around 37 % of companies admit to doing this and take what they find into account when hiring . IEEE Spectrum , The Whistle Blowers Dilemma , april 2004 .

The reason why governments are cracking down on internet anonymity is exactly this : they dont like being criticized . For example , China recently introduced a bill requiring real name registration of every Chinese internet user , thus hampering free communication and the airing of political dissident opinions . Conversely , internet anonymity has helped in the Arab Uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia : people used anonymising software like TOR to come online and communicate , organize and criticize freely without fear of political repercussions .

People can use the internet to experiment with and construct new identities . Think for example of people who dont have a heteronormative lifestyle -LRB- where heterosexuality is considered the norm/default lifestyle -RRB- : in their own communities they could be condemned , despised and even prosecuted , but because of internet anonymity , they can safely join an online community without fear of social repercussions . Or think of people who through certain life-experiences needed to invent a new identity , for example someone who was addicted to drugs but now has come clean and is ready to build a new life with an authentic profile , this person will continuously be confronted with his or her previous identity . One solution would then be to require social networking sites like Facebook to drop the real-name requirement , which is something that the regional German data protection agency ULD has been arguing for in court .

It is clear that the donor countries do not know how best to spend the money they give as aid . Instead they want their money spent on the latest development fad whether this is the privatisation of basic services , microcredit , conditional cash , or particular infrastructure projects . Development can also be misspent as a result of corruption and a lack of oversight , for example the UK suspended its aid to Uganda as a result of indications it was being misused by the Ugandan government and not going towards helping the poorest people lift themselves out of poverty . The Lords Economic Affairs select committee explained why this is the case ; aid is essentially seen by those entrusted with it as `` free money '' , whose loss will go unnoticed by the giver and whose appropriation is nothing like as morally reprehensible as appropriating local tax revenue . Ghosh , Jayati , Yes : Should rich countries stop sending development aid to India ? , , Vol .346 , No . 7891 , pp.1-42 , p. 20 	The west does not know best
India is a booming economy with GDP growth of 7 % over most of the last twenty years , and it is likely to overtake the UK economy within a decade . As a result development aid today to India is small by comparison to what India itself can and does spend on its poorest citizens . The UK gives just 280 million per year , less than 0.04 % of Indias GDP and only enough to provide 1 per year for every one of Indias poorest . This foreign aid is therefore not essential for poverty reduction in India . Indeed China has been the country most successful at reducing poverty and it has done it through economic growth not large amounts of development aid . Aid money should therefore go to countries that really do need the money for development rather than those who are already succeeding at financing it themselves . 	The money makes no difference
Man is a social being . Therefore people live in communities where decisions that affect the many , are taken by representatives of the many . Thus , a social contract exists between the people and their government . In exchange for part of their autonomy and freedom , the government ensures that policies are made in the best interest of people , even if this might come at the expense of short-term interests for some individuals . This is a typical example of this kind of case . The trend is emptying the countryside , stopping the production of agricultural goods and hollowing the amenities provided by the cities . Even if each individual has a personal incentive to move to the cities , the harm to the cities is greater than their accumulated individual gains . It is in these cases that the state must act to protect its people and ensure long term benefits .

Cities are very appealing to poor people . Even if their living standards in cities might be unacceptable , they get closer to basic goods , such as fresh water , sanitation etc . . However , these things exist because there are productive people in the cities who work and pay taxes . What happens when too many people come at the same time is that public money is stretched too thinly and these basic goods can no longer be provided . This leads to severe humanitarian problems such as malnutrition , thirst , lack of medication , etc . . However , this humanitarian crisis does not only harm those directly affected , it also creates an unattractive environment for business . Thus , people who enter the city can not find work , as production does not grow in relation to the people who enter . They become excluded from society and often turn to crime , which further erodes the economy . Limiting migration to reasonable levels give the cities a chance to develop progressively and become the kind of places that people in rural areas currently believe them to be .

nlimited rural-urban migration erodes the economy of the cities , as shown in the previous argument , and limits their economic growth and available resources . On a national level , this causes decision makers to prioritise the cities , as the country relies more on urban than rural areas , thus preventing them from investing in the country-side . China is a good example of this where urban privilege has become entrenched with special economic zones being created urban areas -LRB- though sometimes built from scratch in rural areas -RRB- with money being poured into infrastructure for the urban areas which as a result have rapidly modernised leaving rural areas behind . This leads to a whole culture of divisions where urbanites consider those from rural areas to be backward and less civilized . Moreover , there will be little other reason to invest in rural areas , as the workforce in those areas has left for the cities . By preserving resources in the cities and keeping the workforce in the rural areas , it becomes possible to invest in rural communities and change their lives for the better as these areas maintain the balanced workforce necessary to attract investors .

The cause of rural-urban migration in developing nations and the main reason why it becomes problematic is that people who move to the cities are not making informed decisions . They are led to believe that the cities contain opportunities that they can not find where they live , and there are no mechanisms such as efficient media or adequate education to eradicate this misconception . Myths can be easily propagated by a single successful migrant returning home to visit that then attracts many others to try their luck without any knowledge of the possible costs . This is exacerbated by unscrupulous organisations that prey on their desperation to take all their money to organise their move to the city . Some of those who are trafficked find themselves brought to the city and exploited through forced labour , begging , or even prostitution . Many of those who move to cities find themselves in a worse situation but have lost any moving power they originally had and are thus trapped . Zhan , Shaohua .

Governments should do everything they can to discourage smoking . They already attempt to do so in a number of ways , such as through ensuring graphic health warnings are present on all tobacco packaging . Many states have also introduced legislation banning smoking indoors in an attempt to discourage the habit . However , smoking is still a massive problem - millions of people still do it . The refusal of medical treatment to smokers would surely be a massive deterrent to current/potential smokers from continuing/starting the habit . The safety net of modern healthcare being pulled from underneath them would be a powerful incentive to give up the habit , and reduce the estimated $ 100 billion that the White House believes smokers cost the economy annually through loss of productivity . 	Denying access to healthcare for smokers would act as a deterrent , discouraging smokers
Failure to quit smoking before surgical procedures increases cardiac and pulmonary complications , impairs tissue healing , and is associated with more infections and other complications at the surgical site . For example , in a study of wound and other complications after hip or knee surgery , no smoker who quit beforehand developed a wound infection compared with 26 % of ongoing smokers and 27 % of those who only reduced tobacco use . Overall complications were reduced to 10 % in those who quit smoking compared with 44 % in those who continued . This means that surgery costs more on average for smokers and is also less likely to be effective . Treating more smokers means devoting more resources for lower results . Therefore , prioritizing non-smokers , at least in certain areas of healthcare , would be beneficial to society as a whole . 	As smokers have a higher chance of harm from surgery due to complications arising from their habit , it is more efficient to prioritize non-smokers
Many people have to wait for surgery when they have fallen ill or gotten injured through no fault of their own . Many of the people they are waiting behind have fallen ill out of choice . This includes smokers who have contracted diseases as a result of their habit . There is a vast array of information , easily available to smokers , on the dangers of cigarettes . If despite this , a person chooses to smoke anyway then it is unfair that others who have fallen ill out of genuine misfortune should have to wait in line behind them for healthcare . This problem is particularly in acute in states that have universal healthcare , where non-smokers are forced to wait in a queue for treatment behind those who have negligently made themselves ill smoking . In Britain for example , they have attempted to avoid this by establishing standards under which surgery is denied to obese patients . Thomas Condliff , the patient , was denied gastric band surgery due to having a body mass index lower than the threshold under which they believed the surgery would be effective . The priority in such cases is and should be with those who have made a conscious decision to develop an unhealthy habit . 	If people choose to harm themselves then they should not be prioritized for care
There are realistic ways a policy of denying healthcare access to smokers could be carried out . Insurance companies already ask lots of health-related questions , often including whether their client is a smoker , when assessing life insurance premiums . In these cases , you are required to give details of your lifestyle by law . Of course , some people do not , however this is to be expected since no law is one hundred per cent effective . Sanctions exist to discourage dishonest behaviour . A similar model could be put in place requiring a declaration of smoker status to the health authority . Indeed , many doctors already enquire about their patients ' smoking statuses on an informal basis . It is also particularly hard to lie about being a smoker for two reasons . First , other people inevitably see you smoking . This means an abundance of witnesses in the case of a dispute , and thus a disincentive to lie . Second , people require doctors to undertake detailed examinations for treatment purposes , thereby allowing them to see obvious outward signs of smoking : tar deposits , tar in cough , yellowed fingernails , etc . . 	The law would act as a deterrent against attempts to conceal a smoking habit to procure healthcare
Smokers contribute a disproportionately large amount to the cost of healthcare . They are a drain on resources . In the UK it is estimated that up to 9,500 beds are blocked daily by smokers , and that up to eight million doctor consultations are required on their behalf each year . A well-informed smoker , unable or unwilling to quit , might assume an increased risk for himself but he would also be indirectly increasing the likelihood of others being unable to access necessary healthcare and this is not fair . Allowing smokers to take scarce beds or organs needed for transplants - that could otherwise go to those suffering from genuine misfortunes - is an unjust allocation of resources . 	Smokers are a drain on economic resources
Giving away toys with meals that are calorie laden and of poor nutritional quality creates an emotional attachment between the child and fast food . This bond will then follow that child into adulthood , making it harder for her to make better nutritional choices in order to become a healthy individual . This ban would break that bond and make it easier for children to grow up to be healthier adults . Storm , Stephanie . McDonalds Trims Its Happy Meal . . July 26 , 2011 . 	Bad nutrition habits start during childhood .
All around the world , obesity has become a serious threat to public health . And the problem starts early on . In the US , for example , 17 % of youth are obese4 Obesity itself has many consequences ; most obviously on health such as increasing the risk of numerous diseases like heart disease , there are however economic costs both for treatment of these diseases , lost working days and due to less obvious costs such safety on transport and its resulting fuel cost . Tackling obesity is therefore well within the purview of government policy . A failure to act might seriously affect the economic productivity of the nation , and even bankrupt healthcare systems . A measure like the toy ban would be a first step to tackling the problem at the root , preventing children from growing up into obese adults . Zahn , Theron , Obesity epidemic forcing ferries to lighten their loads , , 20 December 2011 , Obesity could bankrupt the NHS . 15 December 2006 . 	Obesity is a public health issue .
As well meaning as parents may be in trying to guide their kids toward better nutritional choices , they face a formidable opponent : the fast food marketing machine that spends over 4 billion dollars on advertising a year , much of it targeted directly at kids . This can create enough pester power from the kids themselves , seduced by the toy that comes with the meal , that it can persuade parents to make bad choices they wouldnt otherwise make . By eliminating at least one layer of negative pressure , this law would help parents make those healthy choices that they already know are best . Philpott , Tom .

Unlike adults , children are not able to make healthy decisions for themselves . They dont understand what calories , sodium content , or saturated fats are . They are unable to comprehend the long-term effects that fast food might have on their health and development . On the other hand , a toy is instantly appealing to them and offers a straightforward incentive to opt for such a meal . As long as the negative consequences can not be explained to kids in a clear and compelling manner , we should not make unhealthy food even more desirable for them .

A free labour market provides a space for sharing -LRB- knowledge , ideas , and socio-cultural traditions -RRB- , competing , and sustaining efficiency in development . As neoliberal theory advocates a laissez-faire approach is fundamental for growth . A free labour market will enhance economic productivity . Free labour movement enables access to new employment opportunities and markets . Within the East African Community the Common Market Protocol -LRB- CMP -RRB- -LRB- 2010 -RRB- has removed barriers towards the movement of people , services , capital , and goods . Free regional movement is granted to citizens of any member state in order to aid economic growth . Free movement is providing solutions to regional poverty by expanding the employment opportunities available , enabling faster and efficient movement for labour , and reducing the risk of migration for labour . Similar to initial justifications of Europes labour market , a central idea is to promote labour productivity within the region . Much criticism has been raised with regards to the flexible labour market in Europe - with high unemployment across national member states such as Spain , Ireland , and Greece ; the prevalent Euro-crisis , and backlash over social welfare with rising migration . Disparities remain in jobs , growth , and productivity across the EU . 	Free movement will provide benefits for productivity .
National borders are a result of Africas colonial history . The boundaries constructed do not reflect meaning or unite ethnic groups across the continent . The border between Togo and Ghana alone divides the Dagomba , Akposso , Konkomba and Ewe peoples . Therefore encouraging freedom of movement across Africa will erase a vital component of Africas colonial history . The erasing of boundaries , for labour markets , will have significant impacts for rebuilding a sense of unity , and reducing xenophobic fears , of which have been politically constructed . A sense of unity will motivate citizens to reduce disparities and inequalities of poverty . Cogneau , 2012 , pp.5-6 	Policies towards a free labour market will create unity .
Mobility is a human right - which needs to be enabled across national spaces and Africa . Obstacles need to be removed . Mobility enables access to interconnected rights - such as ensuring women their right to move enables empowerment in the political , social and economic spheres . Taking the case of migration of young people , the process reflects a right of passage , a means of exploring opportunities and identity.For example the Mourides of Senegal have established a dense network sustaining informal trading across multiple scales based on a foundation of Brotherhood youths leaving rural areas become integrated into dynamic social networks and educated within the Mouride culture . As research in Tanzania shows although migration is not a priority for all youths , many identify the opportunity as a time to prove yourself and establish your transition into adulthood . The process empowers human identity and rights . 	The freedom to move is a human right .
Even without the implementation of a free labour market , migration will continue informally ; therefore policies introducing free movement and providing appropriate travel documents provides a method to manage migration . In the case of Southern Africa , the lack of a regional framework enabling migration is articulated through the informal nature of movement and strategic bilateral ties between nation-states . Several benefits arise from managing migration . First , speeding up the emigration process will provide health benefits . Evidence shows slow , and inefficient , border controls have led to a rise in HIV/AIDs ; as truck drivers wait in delays sex is offered . Second , a free labour market can provide national governments with data and information . The provision of travel documentation provides migrants with an identity , and as movement is monitored , the big picture of migration can be provided . Information , evidence , and data , will enable effective policies to be constructed for places of origin and destination , and to enable trade efficiency . Lastly , today , undocumented migrants are unable to claim their right to health care . In Africa , availability does not equate to accessibility for new migrants . In South Africa , migrants fear deportation and harassment , meaning formal health treatment and advice is not sought -LRB- Human Rights Watch , 2009 -RRB- . Therefore documentation and formal approval of movement ensures health is recognised as an equal right . See further readings : Lucas , 2012 . 	Implementing a free labour market will enable effective management of migration .
The increase in low-cost Mexican goods has benefitted US consumers , thereby improving the standard of living for working Americans . US exports have increased by $ 104 billion , thereby bolstering manufacturing . While some jobs have been lost due to NAFTA , these have been primarily low-skill jobs ; reducing the number of low-skill jobs in the economy allows the US to concentrate on more profitable , white-collar jobs . And even these low skilled workers benefit from having to pay less for their goods . Marla Dickerson , `` NAFTA has had its Tradeoffs for the U.S. : Consumers and Global Companies Benefitted , but Critics See Pitfalls , '' Los Angeles Times , March 3 , 2008 .

The US has benefitted from NAFTA through lower prices and increased trade .
Trade liberalization has caused social upheaval that created greater demand for genuine democracy within Mexico . The election of 1994 is considered to be the first free election in the modern history of Mexico . In 2000 , the first opposition president -LRB- not a member of the Institutional Revolution Party -RRB- since 1929 was elected . Many scholars credit the liberalized economic environment fostered by NAFTA for this political development towards a genuine democracy . Kevin Kelley , `` Good NAFTA ? , '' Utne : The Best of the Alternative Press , 2011 , 2 . Renee G. Scherlen , `` Lessons to Build on : the 1994 Mexican Presidential Election , '' Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs , 1998 , 21 .

By expanding their free trade regions to the entire continent , Canada , the US , and Mexico have demonstrated the plausibility of greater international cooperation . Although NAFTA is not on the scale of the EU , it similarly demonstrates the ability of nations to work together for mutual benefit , thereby increasing international cooperation . NAFTA helps create a secure North American continent where none of the states need be worried about the other members in much the same way as the European Union does in Europe . Competition and potentially wars are prevented through greater trade integration as is shown by European integration since the second world war . 	NAFTA has bolstered cross-continental cooperation .
Operating at maximum productivity is one of the most important aspects of an efficient economy . The right resources and technology must be combined to produce the right amount of goods to be sold for the right price . Therefore all markets should strive for highest efficiency . In order to maximize efficiency in the international economy , countries need to utilize their comparative advantage . This means producing what you are best at making , compared to other countries . If Mary is the best carpenter and lawyer in the US , but makes more money being a lawyer , she should devote more of her time to law and pay someone for her carpentry needs . Mary has an absolute advantage in law and carpentry , but someone else has a comparative advantage in carpentry . Comparatively it makes more sense for someone else to do the carpentry , and for Mary to be the lawyer . It is the same in the international economy . Countries can be more efficient and productive if they produce what they are best at based on their domestic resources and populations , and trade for other goods . This promotes efficiency and lower prices . Free trade enhances this . The Doha round that is currently being debated in the World Trade Organization would reduce trade barriers and promote free trade , economies of scale , and efficient production of goods . It is estimated that the Doha round would increase the global GDP by $ 150 billion alone just by promoting free trade . Free trade leads to specialization and efficient production , which ultimately would increase the size of the global economy and the individual economies in it . 	Free trade promotes global efficiency through specialization .
Through global competition , specialization , and access to technology , free trade and openness allow countries to grow fasterIndia and China started in the 1980s with restrictive trade policies , but as they have liberalized they have also improved their growth enormously . The International Trade Commission estimates that a free trade agreement between just Colombia and the US would increase the US GDP by $ 2.5 billio . When industries have to compete with competition around the world , they are pushed towards innovation and efficiency . Entrepreneurs are more productive if they have to compete . Free trade increases access to technology which also increases overall development . Because of free trade , prices are lower for everyone . Trade offers benefits to both developed and developing nations by encouraging competition , efficiency , lower prices , and opening up new markets to tap into . 	Free trade promotes growth in all countries .
There has long been a debate as to whether aid or trade is more effective in promoting development and cooperative relationships . Being interlocked through trading relationships decreases the likelihood of war . If you are engaged in a mutually beneficial relationship with other countries , then there is no incentive to jeopardize this relationship through aggression . It leads to more cooperative relationships because trading partners have incentives to consider the concerns of their trade partners since their economic health is at stake . This promotes peace , which is universal good . In 1996 , Thomas Friedman famously pointed out that no two countries with a McDonaldsa sign of western liberal economic policieshave ever gone to war together . Academic studies have shown that this is specifically a result of free trade . In 2006 Solomon Polachek of SUNY Binghamton and Carlos Seiglie of Rutgers found that the last 30 years have shown that economic freedom is 50 times more likely to reduce violence between countries than democracy . Erik Gartzke of Columbia University rated countries economic freedom on a scale of 1 -LRB- least free -RRB- to 10 -LRB- most free -RRB- . He analyzed military conflicts between 1816 and 2000 and found that countries with a 2 or less on the economic freedom scale were 14 times more likely to be involved in armed conflicts than those with an 8 or higher . Aside from war , free trade also solidifies countries alliances . For example , the US wants to begin a free trade relationship with South Korea to create a concrete partnership that will ultimately lead to greater cooperation Free trade promotes global connections and peace and therefore is a beneficial force . 	Free trade creates substantial cooperative relationships between trading partners .
Both the Labour and Conservative parties in the UK , the Conservatives in Canada , the Socialists in France and many others all over the world have gone through periods of regrouping following extended periods in office . Political movements simply run out of fresh ideas after prolonged periods of government and the Republican Party is going through such a period . The Bush Mantra of a presumption in favour of financial deregulation and in favour of tax cuts to create a trickle-down effect have both been proven to be wrong or at least were taken to too great an extreme . The country needs to rebalance just as the Republicans need to find new ideas and new standard bearers . Future leaders of the party like Marco Rubio and Tim Pawlenty may have interesting ideas by 2016 but the current leadership is a busted flush . 	Just as with other parties around the world , once the dominant argument of a political party proves to be a busted flush it takes about a decade to recover
Its difficult for a predominantly working class party to get all that excited about the choice between a range of millionaires . The Bush presidency made it all too clear that the interests of the rich are the primary interest of the party and that it fails to deliver on areas such as a commitment to smaller government . As party activists becomes ever more obsessed with issues such as gay marriage or the flag-burning amendment , it simply fails to address the concerns of most Americans to whom it has little to say . Until it has a clearer and reasonable economic message , there is little it has to say and less worth listening to . 	The leadership of the Republican Party simply has nothing to do with its membership as a result no candidate has , or can , capture the imagination .
The Tea Party movement has hijacked the Republican Party , bullying elected representatives to pursue a very narrow political agenda that has more to do with their moral outlook than the traditional role of politics . The Tea Party has little in the way of a political programme and nothing in the way of understanding the nuances of local politics or the realities of electoral politics . While the party remains in thrall to this vociferous but unrepresentative minority , it has little to offer the wider party and les to offer the wider American public . Although they are strident in terms of what they are against , they have little to offer by way of a substantive contribution to the national debate . 	The Republican Party has been hijacked by the Tea Partiers who simply dont have a coherent message or ideology
It is a basic tenant of all religions that they divide humanity into us and them believers and non-believers . However , the divisions of society perceived by religious believers do not stop there , and have a tendency to reflect the social and moral views of an earlier and far less progressive age . As well as condemning those who practice other faiths , or who choose to follow no faith , they have fought , and continued to fight , the expansion of the rights of women and of socially marginalised castes , among other social groups . All of the major churches and sects have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world , and most of them are still desperately trying to ignore the existence of modernity . While justifying their political and moral positions through obtuse and deliberately obscure interpretations of religious texts , obscure texts even the mainstream interpretations of major religions are usually sexist , frequently racist and almost universally homophobic . Preventing access to contraception is the single largest block to women getting out of poverty . There are many other examples of the excesses and double standards of mainstream religion too many examples to pick one . 	Religious organisations tend to act as a reactionary pull on wider society opposing egalitarian reforms and developments
Although in much of the world the days of the crusades and the inquisition may be gone , there are plenty of nations were religious disobedience still is still punished harshly , summarily or extra-judicially . In other countries , semi-official militias are left to enforce the minutiae of religious law , although usually in such a way as to disadvantage women and others already persecuted in society . It should be noted that what tends to be the focus of such persecution is a lack of adherence to an ultra-orthodox position . It is frequently a cover for political or social prejudice . Charges of heresy or apostasy are easy to level and nigh on impossible to disprove . Even beyond these extremes , demands for religious observance play out in US elections and , inexplicably , the views of religious leaders are sought on areas where they really have no relevant expertise at all , such as advances in medical progress . Those who disagree on matters such as stem cell research or gay rights are , apparently , arguing with the Almighty . 	Regardless of the protestations of some there is no major religion that has not been involved in persecuting non-believers at some point in its history and most still are
Particularly in the case of contemporary Islam , although other historical examples could be referred to , the combination of certainty and the promise of life after death is a sure route towards violence . That said , Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland demonstrated this until recently ; the Yugoslav wars between Catholics , Orthodox and Muslims , both sides of the battle for Israel/Palestine and many others in history could also be thrown into the mix . Allowing people the opportunity to claim that Gods on our side can be used to justify anything , especially when He appears to be fighting on both sides . 	Because religion combines dogmatic certainty with the existence of the afterlife , violence and death is all too easy to justify
In terms of physical risk it is almost certainly true that you have nothing to fear from government having loads of information . With the exception perhaps of the Russian FSB and despite the James Bond films intelligence agencies in democracies are not in the habit of bumping people off this mortal coil . In this sense it does not matter at all what information the intelligence services have on you ; no matter how naughty you may have been it is not going to be worth some kind of physical retaliation . Essentially the argument here is that it does no harm , and even does some good , so why should it not continue ? 	There is no physical risk
If the concern is privacy then there really should be little concern at all because there is safety in numbers . The NSA and other intelligence services dont have the time or motivation to be tracking down all of our foibles . If the intelligence agencies are watching everyone then they clearly do not have the personnel to be watching the actual communications . Instead certain things or patterns will raise alarm bells and a tiny number will be investigated more closely . Walt , Stephen M. , The real threat behind the NSA surveillance programs , , 10 June 2013 , 	No one will ever actually look at the information
Clearly much of the time you really do have nothing to worry about when it comes to intelligence agencies having information about you . People are not regularly arrested without just cause and we have little evidence that democratic governments use this information to put pressure on their citizens . There have been no known cases of this happening since the start of the war on terror . When it comes to foreign governments this is even less of a cause for concern ; while your own government might be interested in various aspects of your life to help it with the services it provides foreign governments only have one motivation ; their own national security . If you are not a threat to that national security the chances of them ever taking any action against you are essentially nonexistent . Posner , Eric , I Dont See a Problem Here , , 10 June 2013 , 	You are not going to be arrested because the government has access to your communications
In democracies there are numerous safeguards and levels of oversight to prevent abuse . In the UK for example there is a strong framework of democratic accountability and oversight . Agencies are required to seek authorisation for their operations from a Secretary of State , normally the Foreign Secretary or Home Secretary . The Secretary is given legal advice and comments from civil servants . Once the Secretary has given assent they are subject to independent review by an Intelligence Services Commissioner and an Interception of Communications Commissioner to ensure that they are fully compliant with the law . Hague , William , Prism statement in full , , 10 June 2013 , 	There are safeguards to prevent misuse
The clearest , and most common , reason for the military stepping in is to restore peace to the country . When the stakes are so high , power through control of government , the ability to distribute resources , it is something well worth fighting for . The result can be that democracies become unstable and violent with election campaigns particular flashpoints . The runup to the Thai elections in 2014 shortly before the coup left 10 dead and 600 injured with no sign of stability returning after the flawed elections General Prayuth Chan-ocha the head of the army said the coup was necessary in order for the country to return to normality quickly , and for society to love and be at peace again . When there violence creating violence it is the military 's role to step in the prevent such instability .

Democracy does not mean that a country is not corrupt , or that the political leadership is not corrupt . There are many countries where democratic elections stand side by side with a large amount of corruption ; Afghanistan , Libya and Iraq countries that have recently had elections following western intervention are ranked 175 , 172 , and 171 out of 177 on the corruption perceptions index . Even countries with long established democracies can be perceived as being corrupt , India is 94 . If the political class is incapable of reforming itself it may be necessary for another actor to do it for them . There have been several coups in which the military has taken power in order to reform the political system before handing over to a civilian government at elections ; Turkey in 1960 , Portugal in 1974 , and the relatively recent coup in Bangladesh in 2007 .

The internet magnifies the problem of embarrassing personal data and makes it very hard for people to manage the consequences . In real life , though we suffer consequences for our embarrassing behaviour -LRB- or behaviour others think is embarrassing -RRB- , we can manage it easier , e.g . by talking to the people involved or as a final resort moving . The internet means the humiliating material is rapidly exposed to millions of people around the world , meaning that people can face humiliation anywhere without an ability to manage it . There are evencases of young people taking their lives after bullying and cyber-bullying that followed information about them being posted online . The most famous case is that of teenager Amanda Todd , who committed suicide after half-nude photos were posted online she could not escape ridicule even after she moved schools , because photos remained online -LSB- 10 -RSB- . Because real life actions are not enough to manage consequences of humiliating personal data , new ways suitable for the digital sphere have to be created , and that way is the right to be forgotten . 	People suffer disproportional consequences on the internet
People can not control information that others post about them , for instance embarrassing photos from parties . Even if the original source came from people themselves , they can not delete this information if it has been shared by other people on their social media channels . For example , Ghyslain Razas video of himself goofing around with a golf stick pretending to be in Star Wars , was uploaded by his classmates without his consent -LSB- 6 -RSB- . While the video went viral without Ghyslain being able to delete all of its appearances at different sites , he himself suffered merciless bullying online and in real life -LSB- 7 -RSB- . There even are people who exploit peoples inability to delete embarrassing content relating to them online . Revenge porn , which is uploading private material of sexual nature of ex-partners online in an effort to humiliate them , is especially hard to delete and prosecute -LSB- 8 -RSB- . Since embarrassing information can end up online without a persons consent and is very difficult to delete using current policy measures , the right to be forgotten is the only way to help these people . 	People need protection against harmful information posted by others
People make silly mistakes , especially when they are young . The age from which you can join Facebook is 13 and pretty much anyone can post videos to Youtube , run a blog or post comments . It is then no surprise that people can leave unflattering information about themselves that at that moment they considered to be worth posting . However , this is just a one-sided representation of a person , because many good things can not be well represented online , e.g . nobody posts a video of oneself working hard . Nevertheless , this one-sided representation can have very damaging consequences to a person . For instance , a well-known case is of Stacy Snyder who was refused a teaching certificate by her university because of a picture of her as a drunken pirate on myspace.com , and not because she was a bad student -LSB- 4 -RSB- . More importantly , current measures to delete information might not be enough , as digital information stays in internet archives , social media archives -LRB- such as profileengine.com -RRB- , orcan just be reposted by people on other sites and their own social media pages . Given this and the fact that these are not who people truly are , it is unfair to deny them the right to erase things that damage their reputation . 	It is unfair for people to suffer for silly past mistakes
North Korea has an attention seeking cycle on the go that was used by Kim Jong Il and now seems to be used by his son Kim Jong Un . Essentially North Korea takes a provocative action -LRB- as big or small as it thinks necessary this may be a missile launch , right up to some kind of military attack -RRB- in order to grab the worlds attention . There is then a period where there are condemnations and threats to increase sanctions that usually dont get anywhere as they are blocked by China . The North Korean regime will then proclaim a willingness to do business and negotiate giving minor concessions on the issue of the provocation in return for aid or whatever the regime happens to want at the time . Of course whatever concession it gives is easily reversible so setting up another round . This is a good deal for North Korea as it essentially gets aid in return for bad behaviour , it is therefore not surprising that the North is willing to continue engaging in bad behaviour . Hong , Adrian , How to Free North Korea , , 19 December 2011 , 	Providing attention simply encourages the regime
The responses to North Korean provocations do not bring a solution any closer . North Korea has yet to sign a peace treaty with the South and the United States . It is however particularly interested in signing a treaty with the United States rather than the South . In 2010 the North Korean foreign ministry proposed that `` If confidence is to be built between -LSB- North Korea -RSB- and the US , it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war , a root cause of the hostile relations , to begin with '' . The North wants a peace treaty with the US so as to drive a wedge between the USA and South Korea to prevent US support for the South in the event of war . Ignoring such efforts at negotiating with the USA without South Korea in the room , and indeed all advances and provocations would force the North to accept that it has to negotiate with the south or with no one . Ignoring North Korean actions and reducing the number of allies negotiating while maintaining security guarantees prevents any chance of the North dividing the USA and South Korea . Walker , Peter , North Korea calls for peace treaty with US , , 11 January 2010 , Cheon , Seongwhun , Negotiating with South Korea and the I.S . : North Koreas Strategy and Objectives , , Vol XVI No 1 , Spring 2012 , p. 153 	Rounds of sanctions and engagement does not bring a solution any closer
The two Koreas should be able to solve the situation themselves without recourse to all the neighbouring powers whose interest does not seem to have spurred a solution to the frozen conflict anyway . With the Cold War over South Korea is more than capable of handling its own security . South Korea is economically far ahead of the North with its economy thirty seven times bigger . Its military is also more capable than the Norths as the International Institute for Strategic Studies argues As measured by static equipment indices , South Koreas conventional forces would appear superior to North Koreas . When morale , training , equipment maintenance , logistics , and reconnaissance and communications capabilities are factored in , this qualitative advantage increases . So should be able to deter aggression on its own and pull its own weight in negotiations without the need of a multilateral process . Moreover no one would argue that an invasion should be ignored however the South should be the one who responds to North Korean actions on its own .

The EU has welcomed poorer entrants than Turkey without disaster ; Ireland , Spain , Portugal and Greece were all much poorer than the EU average when they joined and all are now well integrated and much more prosperous . Disastrous migration was forecast in their cases too , but did not occur . Nor is Turkey as poor as has been suggested ; Turkey with a GDP per capita of $ 8215 in 2009 is richer than Romania at $ 7500 and Bulgaria with a GDP per capita of $ 6423 both of which are already members . Turkeys economy is also in the process of reform , including the restructuring of its banking system and IMF programmes ; in the next few years this process will allow for faster , more sustained growth . Turkey provides a large new market for EU goods ; should it be accepted into the single market the economic benefits would not be solely limited to that country . Turkeys inclusion in the EU would not threaten other members with overwhelming economic or immigration issues . It is possible that , as has happened with Bulgaria and Romania , that a delay is enacted for the Schengen passport-free zone . This would give both the current EU and Turkey a period of time to adjust . 	Turkey is a poverty stricken country and entry into the EU would help to raise the living standards for its entire population
Romania and Bulgaria , who have by far the worst human rights records , were prioritized over Turkey when they were granted the right of accession , joining the EU in 2007 . The EU rewarded states that have made a big effort to democratize and change policy in order to be allowed in to the EU . By essentially procrastinating on Turkey 's case , the EU are discouraging Turkey from making the required changes to their legislature and norms and thus hindering their chances of accession . Countries such as Hungary , Poland , and the Czech Republic were pressurized to reform at a rapid pace after being promised by the EU they would likely be in the EU in a relatively short period of time ; Turkey has been given no such promises . Turkey should have even more ` right ' to be in the EU as these states , as it formally applied for membership long before these states and should thus be given priority over them . 	Turkey has precedents , such as Romania and Bulgaria , both of whom were accepted into the EU
Turkey is a key geo-political strategic ally to the West and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation . `` Turkey is a secular Muslim democracy and a crucial ally for the West . The eastern flank of NATO , straddling Europe and Asia , it played a critical role in containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War . In the 1990s , it helped monitor Saddam Hussein and protect Iraqi Kurds by permitting U.S. warplanes to use its bases . After the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , it became a staging area for coalition forces in Afghanistan , where Turkish forces eventually assumed overall command of the International Stabilization Force . Turkey continues to be a pivotal partner in the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups , despite attacks by radical Islamists at home . '' 	Turkey joining the EU would help the international fight against terrorism
Turkey was promised a chance to join the EU by a unanimous vote at the Helsinki summit in 1999 , when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent Turkish requests . As a candidate country Turkey should be allowed in once it meets the membership criteria which were first set out in the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 . These were stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities , the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political , economic & monetary union . Clearly economic and political reforms are necessary , but that is true of all states attempting to join the EU and should not be used as an excuse to backtrack now . It would be hypocritical to apply one set of criteria to Central and Eastern European states and another to Turkey . Such blatant hypocrisy would have consequences , if the EU is seen to break its promise to Turkey it may turn a potential friend and partner into a suspicious and hostile neighbour . 	Any country that fulfils the accession criteria should be allowed to join
Argentina formally took posession of the islands in 1820 and established permanent settlements in that decade . Previous settlements by Spain and Britain had been military in nature -LRB- garrisons -RRB- . Britain did not protest to these acts of sovereignty . The Argentinean settlements were only ended by illegal military force , the first strike by an American warship , acting on its own initiative and encouraged by the British in Buenos Aires , and the second and last blow by a British taskforce . 	Argentina created a permanent settlement
Both Argentina and the islands were under Spainish sovereignty . Spain ruled the islands from Argentina they were therefore part of the same territory doing so free of British intervention -LRB- or complaints -RRB- from 1770 until 1811 , i.e . 41 years . Upon independence from Spain , Argentina rightfully asserted sovereignty over the former Spanish territory , a principle that would latter be known under international law as . Britain did not claim sovereignty over the islands when Spain left them in 1811 . Nor did Britain immediately challenge Argentinas assertion of sovereignty in 1820 , when David Jewett claimed the islands for Argentina , or in 1825 , when the first treaty between the new country and Britain was signed . 	Argentina inherited Spains claim to sovereignty
European Union has been based on principles of solidarity and mutual help . This means that sometimes , in order to ensure the greater good , one has to forgo a bit of his own self-interest . Because European Union holds together 28 culturally and economically different countries , qualified majority voting is sufficient to ensure that no state will be harmed by the decisions made on the international level . The fact that some states would like to retain their right of veto undermines the basic principles of the EU because no such process , where a single state is able to prevent majority from adopting a measure can be called democratic . It this system the minority , or individual state , can ignore the will of the majority indefinitely . Moreover , Zamora -LRB- in Sieberson , 2010 -RRB- states that international agreement is impossible to obtain when any single participant can block a decision ; to achieve unanimous consent a decision must be diluted so as to please everyone , concluding that such result is unsatisfactory and prohibits effective functioning of an international organization , mainly in regards to urgent , practical problems . Sieberson , SC 2010 , Inching Toward EU Supranationalism ? Qualified Majority Voting and Unanimity Under the Treaty of Lisbon , , vol . 50 , no . 4 , pp . 932 , viewed 29 September 2013 , < http : //www.vjil.org/articles/inching-toward-eu-supranationalism-qualified-majority-voting-and-unanimity-under-the-treaty-of-lisbon > . 	The requirement for unanimity is undemocratic
With Greece as a trigger , the Eurozone and the whole EU have significantly suffered in the last five years as a result of massive and still on-going economic crisis . The Euro currency is , damaged by the vast differences between individual Eurozone members , with respect to their fiscal and monetary policies . While some states -LRB- commonly referred to as PIIGS -RRB- do have bigger problems with their finances , it is unthinkable for the others to be held responsible when serious issues , such as an inability to pay the debts , arise . Nevertheless , this was the case with Greece , when tens of billions of taxpayers money were used to service debts of one irresponsible state . Despite more than 50 % of private sector debt being cut down by creditors , the threat of Greeces default still lingers in the air . Getting rid of the unanimity requirement would make Europe much more able to respond quickly to crises . In the long run it would make negotiations for a federal union much easier , eventually turning it into reality . Achieving political integration and the abandonment of the veto that would come with it would then enable solutions to economic problems benefiting the whole even it unpalatable to some . Such position is also taken by Jacques Attali , a French economist who argues that the institutional reform towards a federal Europe is necessary to implement a common fiscal and budgetary system . Attali , J 2012 , Attali : A federal Europe is the only crisis exit strategy , 18 April , viewed 29 September 2013 , < http : //www.euractiv.com/euro-finance/attali-federal-europe-crisis-exi-interview-512208 > . 	Disposing of unanimity requirement would make it easier advance the long-needed federalization of the European Union
Unanimous voting provides states seeking additional gains with a tool to actually achieve their egoistic goals . In order for the whole Union to pass legislation that would be beneficial to all , a single state has power to negotiate further benefits for itself , thus holding up a deal and sometimes making it less beneficial for others . Similar concerns were expressed in the EU Commission as consensus requirement often holds policy-making hostage to national interest . What is more , such behavior sets dangerous precedents that nations can put national interests in front of communal , effectively deteriorating the cooperative spirit of the EU and eventually destroying it altogether . As Sieberson claims , such was the case of French objections to the Treaty of Rome regarding the wider use of qualified majority voting in the fields of agriculture and the internal market . In the empty chair crisis France boycotted Council meetings for seven months , until the deal called Luxembourg accord was struck . The Luxembourg accord is widely believed to have created a period of stagnation in the Community Paul Craig describes this period as the prime example of negative intergovernmentalism . It prevented consolidation of Europe and ensured the EC remained intergovernmental by effectively curtailing qualified majority voting as any state could veto by invoking national interests . , 2001 , Commission of the European Communities , pp . 29 , viewed 29 September 2013 , < http : //eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0428en01.pdf > .

Unanimity requirement gives an enormous bargaining leverage to the hands of individual states
Government intervention in the marketplace contradicts the values of free-trade advocated by western liberal democracies . The complexities of agricultural subsidies , price supports , regulations and protective tariffs means that farming in the US and the EU now has the air of a command economy . Coupled with highly liberal international trade markets and the relative ease of shipping foodstuffs around the world , subsidy schemes are increasingly subject to manipulation by farmers seeking to maximise the size of their support payments without engaging in additional productive activity . For example , set-aside payments have been used by both European and American administrations to encourage farmers to leave a proportion of their fields fallow , in order to maintain the productivity and fertility of farming soil . However , many farmers have claimed set-aside payments by designating fertile land that is difficult or impossible cultivate -LRB- land on steep inclines , land obstructed by streams -RRB- as fallow fields . By promoting behaviour of this type , however inadvertently , the CAP and Americas Farm bills effectively reduce the credibility and good will that the west can command when engaged in trade talks with developing states . Policy makers may attempt to frame the debate over subsidies in terms of food supply security . However , the de facto protectionism of current subsidies regimes does nothing more than trade diplomatic credibility and geo political security for stable domestic food prices . Other countries that the developed world is engaging in protectionism and so are unwilling to compromise in areas where the developed world wants changes as a result the Doha trade round is going nowhere , the developed world has to concede and abolish these subsidies . 	Free trade and aid distribution
Subsidies can contribute significantly to longer term ecological and environmental damage . By rendering the export of food so profitable , subsidies increase the use of air freight and rapid road haulage , increasing the emissions cost of trading produce . Subsidies also cause the loss of land management and farming skills amongst the working population of developing states . As small farmers and more affluent land owners are priced out of domestic markets by imports from the developed world , they will increasingly turn to alternative methods of making money . Farming skills will not be passed on to other family members or to agricultural workers . Unemployed agricultural workers will be affected by deskilling . In addition , they may migrate away from their home states in search of jobs . Otherwise useful , fertile land may be left fallow , becoming damaged and eroded due to neglect . Subsidies encourage monoculture farming the large scale production of specialised produce . Subsidies instituted by the US government that were intended to encourage the production of maize for use in biofuels led many farmers to give over excessive acreage to the crop . Monoculture crops can expose farmer to economic risks that subsidies can not compensate for . If a particularly virulent strain of disease attacks a monoculture crop it is likely to spread quickly , assisted by the large , un-partitioned fields and storage areas that are characteristic of the practice . This , in turn , will lead to widespread crop failure , incurring significant losses for the farmers involved . Moreover , the need to protect large amounts of uniformly vulnerable biomass from pests and disease causes farmers to employ large quantities of pesticides , insecticides and herbicides , all of which can damage soil quality , pollute water sources and harm local biodiversity . Finally , subsidies also encourage intensive agricultural production in unsuitable or unstable areas . Examples of this practice include the cultivation of fruit and vegetable crops in naturally arid areas of south California . Successful cultivation of this produce has necessitated the construction of extensive and disruptive irrigation networks . The burden that irrigation has placed on the Sacramento-san Joaquin delta , west of San Francisco has become so great that the salinity of delta water is now slowly increasing , due to tidal intrusion of seawater . This change in the salt content of irrigation water threatens to pollute the same soil that the irrigation system feeds . 	Subsidies incentivise environmentally harmful farming practices
Gaddafi was an oppressive ruler who led Libya for 42 years . The country had no Parliament , political parties , or NGOs and no civil society -LSB- 1 -RSB- . He ruled Libya with an iron fist , eliminating any political opposition , restricting peoples rights and worst of all supporting different terrorist groups around the world . The same man was responsible for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , which killed 270 people -LSB- 2 -RSB- and he supported the leadership of Iddi Amin a dictator who killed masses in Uganda . His leadership posed a threat not only to Libya but to countries around the world . Western intervention in the Libyan civil war paved a clear path for the downfall of Gaddafis rule . We should consider the downfall of such a dictator to be a success and benefit to Libya and all who Gaddafi threatened . -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 2 -RSB- 	A long ruling and ruthless dictator was toppled .
From the day of the uprising in Benghazi , the government was committed to fight back till the end . Gaddafi asserted that he will chase down the protesters and cleanse house by house while his son said that rivers of blood would flow with thousands of deaths , if the uprising didnt stop -LSB- 1 -RSB- . Military jets and helicopter gunships were indiscriminately unleashed upon people who had no means to defend themselves against assault from the air . The resolution of a no fly zone passed by the security council weakened and prevented government forces from killing people and destroying cities using air strikes -LSB- 2 -RSB- . Air strikes went on to destroy artillery , armor and other weapons that could be used for indiscriminate attacks . The intervention therefore stopped large scale civilian bloodshed . -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 2 -RSB- 	Intervention prevented an impending bloodbath in Benghazi .
The uprising sparked off as a concern for freedom in the country , people were tired of the oppressive regime and wanted to be liberated . This could not happen by people power alone ; Gaddafi was willing to crack down to prevent it like Assad in Syria did . Western intervention in the civil war helped the citizens gain power and force to fight for their rights , by providing them with training , intelligence and logistics among others hence ejecting the oppressive leadership a symbol for liberation . After the civil war , people were able to participate in an election of the national assembly considered free and fair for the first time in Libya -LSB- 1 -RSB- . The part of the Mo Ibrahim index that rates participation and human rights rose from 20 % in 2010 to 30.5 % in 2012 -LSB- 2 -RSB- . More democratic and accountable government institutions have been set up , NGOs welcomed and civil society empowered . Libya is becoming much freer with freedom house upgrading the country from not free to partially free -LSB- 3 -RSB- . -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 2 -RSB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- 	Ushered in the liberation of Libya .
A referendum , regardless of the result , will prove an effective public relations boost for the United Kingdom . UK citizens will feel more confident in their government , as some currently see EU membership as an illegitimate breach of the social contract and others argue that the UK is not doing enough to co-operate . Europeans also will improve their view of the United Kingdom : a `` Yes '' vote will minimize the perception of the UK as a foot-dragging , reluctant participant in Europe ; a `` No '' vote will be seen to end a half-hearted charade . Either way , a more straightforward relationship with Europe will minimize UK-Europe mistrust , which will benefit each politically and economically . 	The referendum is good PR for the UK .
The general public will be appeased : 75 % of voters want the vote held . MPs will fulfil their duty to represent constituent interests by calling the referendum . A contented electorate will be more supportive of government and feel included in political life . Not only individuals but also parties will be appeased : the far left and right each feel strongly about this issue . Euroskeptic parties like UKIP and the BNP have agitated for an in-or-out vote for years , and disguise racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as Euroskepticism in the process . A vote either way would settle the issue and make it harder for them to disguise antisocial aspects of their platforms . Pro-Europeans like the Lib Dems also want the referendum : leader Nick Clegg said that `` nothing will do more damage to the pro-European movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide '' by not holding one . Both sides of the political spectrum wants this issue definitively settled . Once it has been , politicians will be able to redirect focus and work on crucial issues like the economy . 	A referendum will create a better political climate .
The public deserve to vote in this referendum because it regards a constitutional issue sovereignty . Beyond constitutionality , referendums maintain democratic society when the publics views and MPs clearly misalign , as they do in this case . This vote will also maintain the established precedent of holding referendums on EU issues . If the British people had to be consulted on EEC membership , as happened in 1975 , they must be consulted on EU membership : the current EU barely resembles the EEC that the UK voted to join long ago , but has greatly magnified stature and power . 	The public have a right to a referendum .
Parliamentary and logistic precedents indicate that holding a referendum about an issue of sovereignty is practical and practicable . There have been two successfully-held national referendums , one the direct antecedent of this one -LRB- the 1975 EEC vote -RRB- and one recently -LRB- the 2011 AV vote -RRB- . The history of national referendums therefore indicates that they are both constitutional and logistically viable . Furthermore , the referendum is legitimized by public desire . A BBC poll in 2009 indicated that 71 % would vote ` no ' to EU membership if a referendum was held , a level of dissatisfaction which indicates the need for a public discussion and vote . 	An in or out referendum would be legitimate .
At present there is a vicious circle whereby women see no point in standing for politics because it is viewed as a male-dominated institution . Positive discrimination is the only way to encourage women to stand . Only if one generation is pushed towards politics can there be role models for potential future women MPs to follow ; for that reason it need not be a permanent measure , just one that gets the ball rolling . It has been proven by a study at the University of Toronto , Canada , that women need inspirational female role models more than men ; they need it to be demonstrated that it is possible to overcome barrier . Positive discrimination would provide this evidence and support . This measure would simply allow women to overcome the institutional sexism in the selection committees of the established political parties , which has for so long prevented a representative number of women from becoming candidates , and would encourage other women to try and emulate that . It 's about changing stereotypes and perception -LRB- particularly of the concept ` leadership ' , which we automatically think of as a male trait -RRB- . This will help achieve true progress in the future . 	Female role models are needed urgently to raise aspirations among young women and change parliamentary practices
Whilst is it possible for men to speak on women 's issues , some topics of debate -LRB- e.g . on family issues or equality in the workplace -RRB- are still seen as less important than economics or foreign policy . Creating more female MPs would encourage more debates about social policy , and so do more to produce constructive legislation of relevance to real people 's lives . For example , Harriet Harman is the first MP to seriously confront the gaps in the treatment of women and other minorities in the workplace . This was previously seen as a ` soft ' issue unworthy of parliamentary attention ; she was more in touch with women 's -LRB- and , of course , many men 's -RRB- priorities and acted upon them . If we want our political system to be in touch with the priorities of everyone , we must to act to increase women 's representation . 	Women must gain positions in Parliament quickly as they would raise awareness about 'less important ' issues such as family and employment rights
In a ` representative ' democracy it is vital that every part of the population be accurately and proportionately represented . The present lack of female voices in parliaments across the world symbolises the continuing patriarchal societal bias . Women are over half of the population , yet less than 20 % of the House of Commons is made up of women . As of 2011 , there are only 72 women -LRB- constituting 16.6 % of all Representatives -RRB- serving in the House of Representatives in the US . In order to truly have a representative government , numbers must be increased to fairly mirror numbers in society . All women shortlists and other artificial means are a quick and effective way of doing this . Even David Cameron , a traditional opponent to positive discrimination for women , when asked whether a meritocracy was more desirable , said `` It does n't work '' ; `` we tried that for years and the rate of change was too slow . If you just open the door and say ` you 're welcome , come in , ' and all they see is a wave of white -LSB- male -RSB- faces , it 's not very welcoming '' . Indeed , a recent report by the Hansard Society said that the numbers of women in UK Parliament could fall unless positive action is taken . Sarah Childs , launching the report , said that `` unless all parties use equality guarantees , such as all-women shortlists , it is most unlikely that they will select women in vacant seats '' . Compulsion is necessary to begin to achieve parity of representation . The Labour party used all-women shortlists in the 1990 's and many well-known female MPs were elected this way . Positive action is vital for reasons of justice and fairness . 	Parliament must be representative of our society and that requires a substantial increase in the number of women which only positive discrimination can achieve
Large companies have an active interest in shaping the structure of the internet . One example of this is the Stop Online Piracy-Act -LRB- SOPA -RRB- , wherein U.S.-based music and movie companies proposed that they themselves would be able to police copyright infringements against websites that are hosted outside of the United States . The phenomenon whereby companies succeed in shaping government policies according to their own wishes is called regulatory capture . Another example from the telecommunications industry is the lobby effort by several large corporations , who have succeeded in eroding consumer protection in their favour . If the government wouldnt have been involved in regulating the internet in the first place , big companies wouldnt have had any incentive to attempt regulatory capture . 	Internet regulation is an attempt by big interest groups to regulate the internet in their favour
Governments around the world are tracking their citizens activities online . They can use all sorts of techniques , like automated data-mining -LRB- i.e . via trawling your Facebook and Twitter accounts -RRB- and deep packet inspection of each electronic message sent -LRB- i.e . intercepting and reading your email -RRB- . All these methods are violations of important principles . The automated data-mining violates the principle that people shouldnt be investigated by their governments unless there is warrant for it -LRB- so there is reasonable suspicion that they have been involved in a crime -RRB- . Also , data mining creates many false positives , leading to citizens being thoroughly investigated without probable cause . Deep packet inspection violates peoples fundamental right to secrecy of correspondence , which is a violation of privacy . The problem with these government policies is that theyre hard to control even in democracies : much of the spying is done by intelligence agencies , which are often able to evade democratic control on account of the need for secrecy rather than transparency . 	Regulating the Internet is a means for governments to spy on their citizens
Governments are trying to control what citizens can and cant say online what they can and cant access . This can vary from France and Germany requiring Google to suppress Nazism in search results to the Great Firewall of China , where the Chinese government almost fully controls whats said and seen on the internet and has an army of censors . This type of internet censorship is bad because citizens should have freedom of speech and uninhibited access to information , a right so fundamental that we have enshrined it in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed by the participants of the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003 	Internet regjulation is a euphemism for censorship
Universities are now under what is perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced - the UK government for example is cutting spending on education by up to 25 % and allowing universities to charge higher tuition fees . Shorter degree courses will help to address these great pressures on all higher education systems . By moving students through university more quickly , they free up capacity so that the increasing demand for higher education can be met within existing resources . And as tuition fees rise in the UK and many other countries as a consequence of government funding cuts , students will benefit from shorter courses that will allow them to graduate with less debt . 	It would help ease management and financial pressures which are becoming an increasing problem for higher education institutions .
If modern students are not up to the demands of higher education , they should not be going to university in the first place . The over-expansion of higher education in the last twenty years has inevitably lowered standards among undergraduates , as well as imposing greater costs on taxpayers . A two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive , and come with considerably less time off than the current system . This would most likely discourage those who see university as simply ` something to do before getting a job ' , thus increasing the value of a degree once more . 	A more work-intensive system would discourage those not suited to higher education from attending and provide a better environment for those who should be there .
Those who left school at 16 or 18 but now want to go to college are often more serious about their studies , often with a more motivated and professional approach than 19 or 20-year-olds who have moved to university by default . We should seek to encourage such committed students , who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation . But mature students want focused , cost-effective courses that do not require them to take three or more years out of a career . For example , at Stafford University where 2-year courses are being trialed , Director for Academic Development Dr Steve Wyn Williams has said that `` Many of our students who opt to do the fast-tracks are mature students who are looking for a career change who are often quite used to working during the summer period when they were in employment '' . It would seem then that the introduction of such courses would encourage more mature students to get better qualifications , and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well as learn more for themselves . 	Shorter degree courses are better for getting mature students into education .
By teaching students for 40 weeks a year rather than less than 30 , the same amount of teaching time can be provided so that students reach degree standard faster . The University of Buckingham has shown over many years that this can be achieved with no loss of quality - they remain highly placed in comparative league tables . At the same time laboratories and lecture theatres do not stand empty for half the year , while students still have 12 weeks of vacation in which they can read and reflect on their learning . 	A two-year degree is more efficient
Those who have damaged society by robbing it of one of its members must pay for their crime . Adam Smith argued We feel that resentment which we imagine he ought to feel , and which he would feel , if in his cold and lifeless body there remained any consciousness of what passes upon earth . His blood , we think , calls aloud for vengeance . It is not just the wronged individual who needs there to be retribution but society as a whole . Everyone in society is wronged by particularly heinous crimes as Blecker says of two horrific crimes Those were my children , my wife that Coker raped and murdered , my sister Speck killed . Smith , Adam , The theory of Moral Sentiments , Sixth Edition , 1790 , p. 62 Blecker , p. 30 	killers must die to satisfy society
For those who are concerned about some of the practical objections to the American death penalty , it is possible to restrict the death penalty to those most deserving of it : the worst of the worst , those like Anders Behring Breivik , Charles Manson and Harold Shipman . The death penalty should not be for people who are convicted as a result of three strikes - in 2004 , someone was convicted of first degree murder with a whole life sentence for lending a friend a car it should not be a default sentence . Liptak , Adam , Serving Life for Providing Car to Killers , , 4 December 2007 , Blecker , p. 210 	Can be reserved for the worst of the worst
It is not clear that the system works at all . The majority of those who apply for asylum are working-age males , which implies that there is a strong economic angle . And worse still , even if countries decide that an applicant has no basis to their claim they are frequently unable to deport them because they often go missing , as 75,000 in Britain have , or because , perversely , they may be punished on return to their country for having sought refuge . So essentially the asylum system provides a loophole for unrestricted immigration , which is both expensive , and dangerous for states . In the age of global terrorism it is a huge risk to allow undocumented individuals to enter and roam freely within any country . 	The Whole System is broken
It is extremely difficult to tell if someone is a genuine asylum seeker or not ; for obvious reasons many will have little or no documentation , and all the evidence that they have suffered persecution may be in a faraway country and impossible to obtain . In many cases it may be impossible to prove that the person claiming asylum is even from the country that they claim to be from . Asylum decisions are therefore based largely on a judgement call by the investigating officer on whether they thing the person in front of them is being truthful or not that leaves the system open to motivated people who are economic migrants or may even pose a security threat . 	The system is open to abuse
There will always be trafficking as long as there are n't open borders . And we should maintain strict controls on both immigration and asylum . States must focus on the needs of their people first , and the reaction of citizens in accepting countries is quite rightly the feeling that their hospitality and good intentions are being abused at the moment . The social harms that these feelings cause - suspicion , xenophobia , racism and disruption of social harmony and tolerance - are too large and too damaging to the actual citizens of states to justify the maintenance of a failing system that may help some few outsiders . The responsibilities of governments to their own citizens must come first . 	States must be responsible to their own citizens first
Israels security wall effectively annexes Palestinian territory . Palestinian leaders assert that the route chosen could lead to almost half of the cultivatable land in the West Bank being annexed . This obviously reduces the viability of any eventual Palestinian state as it will need to rely more on imported food . Most western governments have criticised the barrier because part of its route departs from the so-called Green Line , Israel 's pre-1967 boundary and the internationally recognised border . The route is not based on security considerations , but is clearly political , concerned to tie the land around Israeli settlements to Israel . It also violates property rights , as thousands of acres of land have been taken away from Palestinian owners in order to build the wall and the wide strip of access tracks beside it . This is clearly wrong and a barrier that kept to the 1967 border would have allowed the Palestinians a viable future state while also providing security for Israel . 	Israels security wall annexes Palestinian territory that is needed for a viable state .
The Security wall could weaken the Palestinian position at any peace negotiations , as it affects the facts on the ground which in turn impact negotiations . Creating the barrier essentially unilaterally annexes land to Israel from the West Bank as that land is no longer accessible from the West Bank but is accessible with no restrictions from Israel . Many of these areas that are being annexed are being annexed precisely because they include the Israeli settlements that have been built up in the West Bank so this land is being occupied by Israeli citizens who are having infrastructure built for them . The more this happens the more difficult it will be for Israel to give the land back later . Israel will rightly be able to claim that if only Israelis live within the barrier why should they give that land back as a majority of the population would be against it ? The Israeli government may say that the wall is only a temporary measure , but in the Occupied Territories earlier temporary measures , such as Israeli settlements and military seizure of Palestinian land , have usually proved to be permanent . It is doubtful that Israel would spend $ 1 billion on a temporary measure . 	The security wall will affect peace negotiations .
Any short term security gain will be offset by growing Palestinian resentment against Israel , which could result in a greater number of suicide attacks in Israel . Israelis and Palestinians will need to learn to live side by side ; building an eight metre high wall sends a clear message to Palestinians that Israel is hostile and unwilling to find a permanent solution that would suit both nations . When constructing the barrier through Jerusalem for example the wall splits communities , disrupts everyday life and declares that a shared sovereignty solution is no longer possible for the city both sides claim as their capital . When peoples lives are disrupted by something that they feel is unnecessary and discriminatory it is bound to increase resentment . In this case it is made worse by the barrier being sited on land the Palestinians consider theirs . It should therefore be no surprise if more Palestinians turn to the only way they see that they get any response from Israel - violence . It would be hard to find a better way to radicalise the inhabitants of East Jerusalem . 	Israels security wall will radicalise Palestinians
Israels security wall is a breach of international law . The International Court of Justice -LRB- ICJ -RRB- in the Hague was asked by the United Nations General Assembly to consider the legality of the barrier and , in July 2004 , it ruled that the security wall was a breach of international laws . Specifically , it found that the Fourth Geneva Convention and international human rights conventions did apply in the Occupied Territories . The security wall breached the Geneva Convention because it assisted illegal settlements and its building injured private property owners . Human rights conventions are breached by the wall because it restricts freedom of movement and the right to an adequate standard of living , health and education . The wall cuts through peoples lands therefore depriving them of their property which can in turn mean their livelihood is significantly affected due to not being able to grow as much as before . As with the checkpoints around the west bank the wall prevents freedom of movement which can split peoples place of residence from their place of work or other facilities necessary for life such as schools and hospitals . As the court recognised therefore the barrier therefore substantially impacts on the living standards of the Palestinians . Finally , the Court ruled that the barriers route could allow Israel to annex territory , harming the Palestinians right to self-determination . 	Israels security wall breaches international law
For most professions , getting military service out of the way early in ones career makes sense . Nobody would suggest that members of other professions should be expected to interrupt it when they are at the height of their profession . In reality for most people this would be when they are in their fifties . For professions like acting and music this tends to be the late twenties and early thirties . Indeed , for pop singers in particular their career is likely to be over when they are 35 . In the light of this setting the age limit where it is is uniquely unfair to performers just as it is to athletes . Military service anywhere in the world is considered to be something you undertake before your career , not in the middle of it . Regulations should reflect reality , in this instance that means allowing performers to get on with their careers . 	Having the age of 30 as the cut-off point is uniquely unfair to performers as this is the age when they are likely to be at the height of their fame and towards the end of their career .
The South Korean government issues occasional exemptions to athletes who have won an Olympic gold medal or achieved a similar feat . If we accept that the law ought to be consistent then there is no reason why entertainers should not be proffered the same opportunity . Both professions tend to favour the young and the requirement that military service needs to be completed before the age of thirty mean that either career would be interrupted just at the point when the individual is likely to be at the height of their skills . Equally both groups bring prestige for Korea as a nation . Entertainers like Jung-Ji Hoon -LRB- Rain -RRB- have just as much of a following as athletes such as Park Ji-Sung who , along with his team mates on the Korean national team was exempted from military service for reaching the semi-finals of the world cup . Indeed Rain predominantly works in Korea and has a following throughout the country and the region whereas Park has spent most of his career playing for foreign teams . 	Celebrities , like athletes , enhance the nations image and generate revenue
The career path of celebrities is unusual in that it accretes over time on the basis of the performers standing in the public mind . Unlike other professions this does not lend itself to taking two years out of the limelight , especially years when fame is coming to its height . The media is notoriously fickle and equally well-known for having a short memory . It generally struggles to stay interested in a celebrity if theyre out of the limelight for more than a few weeks . It is simply unfeasible that they would remain interested when someone has been out of the spotlight for over two years . In effect this means that for a Korean musician or actor their career will finish at the age of 29 . In other profession it is possible to build a career around national service and employers know that at some point any young man they employ will need to undertake their military service but celebrities simply arent employed in this way . 	Celebrities are in the unusual position of requiring constant media attention
Fundamentally at its heart this is a humanitarian intervention by the French . The Islamists who took over Northern Mali have been imposing a severe , austere form of Islam demanding `` No cigarettes , no CDs , no radios , no cameras , no jewelry '' and beating those who disobey the rules . Men and women have to sit in separate areas in buses . With Sharia being more strictly enforced with increasing number of amputations despite opposition from the local population .

France has answered a request for assistance issued by the interim president of the Republic of Mali . France is therefore not coming in uninvited . Malis President Traore directly appealed to French President Hollande to provide French military assistance against these terrorist groups that have attacked our front lines of defense . As the former colonial power in much of West Africa , including Mali , France is the obvious country to turn to for help . As a result of this colonial past Mali is a member of the French led Organisation internationale de la Francophonie . Mali is therefore fully within its sovereign rights to ask for assistance and Hollande is right to agree to provide it .

The creation of national social policies which provide secure , and stable , wages for teachers is fundamental . Social policy can make satisfied teachers . A key concern amongst teachers is finance - inadequate wages and insurance . Teacher wages is considerably lower than other formal professions - combining to enforce low morale and occupational motivation as pay is too low to sustain individuals and households -LRB- Bennell , 2004 -RRB- . In South Africa an average teaching salary is 19,535 ZAR in contrast to the 28,235 ZAR average granted in all jobs in South Africa -LRB- Salary Explorer , 2013 -RRB- . Further , social policy is required to introduce teacher pension schemes . Pension schemes are provided for workers within the formal employment sector , by various public organisations - including the government and GEPF . However , some national pension schemes are more developed than others and teachers need to be ensured the profession can provide investments for future security . An ageing population only reinforces its importance . See further readings : GEPF , 2013 . 	Social Policy for satisfied teachers
UNESCO -LRB- 2013 -RRB- report the need for 6.8 mn teachers by 2015 for the right to primary education to be achieved . The teaching workforce requires includes both replacements and additional teachers . Africa has a reality of low teacher-student ratios . In 2012 , 80 students were reported per teacher in the Central African Republic -LRB- World Bank , 2013 -RRB- . Positive schemes are needed to incentivise potential teachers to enter the profession and meet demand . Careers can be encouraged through multiple paths . For example , providing incentives to study teaching as a profession . Tanzanias Ministry of Education provides grants to students entering University to study teaching . 	Social Policy : encouraging teaching careers
Although the extent of rural-urban disparities remains debatable , geographical disparities in living standards and education are articulated across Africa . The location , and provision , of teachers does not always match need . In Uganda , the universalisation of education has been met with inequities , regionally and across socioeconomic groups , in the quality of education -LRB- Hedger et al , 2010 -RRB- . Incentives are required to deploy teachers to districts according to need ; and encourage teachers to relocate . For example , awards need to be provided for teachers to move to rural areas , and the development of teacher housing schemes - providing teachers with houses in new locations . 	Incentivising movement so there are teachers where they are needed
We refer to certain works as ` literary classics ' because of the recognition they have received from the academic world . This is a process which takes time , but more than ever before there is a widespread awareness and general consensus on what is meant by the term ` classic ' in this context . They are chosen because of their individual merits and influences on culture - the most commonly cited single writer being William Shakespeare . He is one of , if not the greatest writer in the English language , so the study of his works is surely essential to anyone learning English for themselves . It is often overstated how much of our current vocabulary we owe to Shakespeare , however the point remains valid that he forms much of the basis for the language we speak and write today . To not study the his writing , along with that of the other great innovators - Chaucer , Milton and Dickens to name but a few , would deprive people of an understanding and awareness of their own culture , and also inhibit the integration of others into the English language and way of life . This issue is also not limited to the UK , as an article in the Boston Globe suggests that more than half of Americans aged 18 to 24 never read books for pleasure . It is almost certainly the case that the compulsory study of certain works would change that figure . : : 	The classics make up a key part of English culture and history that would otherwise be forgotten .
Despite the obvious positives of teaching a variety of works in literature courses , the time constraints and pressures of constant examination mean that this is often impossible . As the director of The National Association for the Teaching of English Ian McNeilly said : `` For a teacher under pressure to deliver results there may be precious little time or inclination to study areas which are not for assessment '' , so in this respect it is essential to ensure a focus on they core classics which are as we have established , regarded as being the best and most engaging way into the study of English . By focusing on the building blocks of English literary thinking , the door is left open for individuals both on their own and with the guidance of teachers to read beyond the classics and build their own interests from these accepted foundations . 	From a practical perspective too much variation in teaching would make examination impossible .
Up to 2009 , the percentage of students in England studying literature to General Certificate of Secondary Education -LRB- GCSE -RRB- level had been declining year on year . In 2010 there was an introduction of a combined language and literature course , although the focus remained more on the teaching of English as a communication skill rather than a cultural art form to be studied in its own right . This demonstrates the well known idea that league tables and passing exams is more important in the education system than the education itself , neglecting the fact that the study of literature requires and improves the basic literacy skills which are at the heart of governmental policy . In 2008 , 37 % of the poorest children did not take a literature exam , leading to the belief that the study of literature for an elite , depriving those who are perhaps most in need of the inspiration and applied study that reading literature provides . This conflict between the time and effort it takes to study the classics and the demand for assessment has been around for some time , and despite the repeated calls for change from previous poet laureates Andrew Motion and Michael Morpurgo it seems that the education sector does not recognise how beneficial the study of these works is to children . : : 	They are widely regarded to be the best and most engaging way to study the subject .
Studies have found that children with parents who smoke are much more likely to use drugs , and especially more likely to smoke cigarettes themselves . Children learn about the dangers of smoking and drugs in school , and know that it can damage health , but their parents are the most influential figures in their lives . If they see their parents , supposedly responsible adults , constantly doing something , then they are bound to think that it is okay for them to do it too . Having a parent who smokes normalises smoking for the child , which is wrong . In order to prevent this from happening , it is necessary to make sure that parents do not smoke in front of their children by punishing them if they do . 	Children who see their parents smoke are more likely to smoke themselves
Children whose parents smoke in the home are exposed to secondhand smoke without any choice ; they cant just leave to avoid the smoky air . Many studies have found a link between secondhand smoke exposure -LRB- through living or working with a smoker -RRB- and an increased risk of heart disease and lung cancer . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family . Because their respiration is hindered and their long term health is threatened , children who are being exposed to secondhand smoke against their will are therefore having their human rights infringed by their parents , and this properly subjects the parents to punishment . 	It is immoral to expose children to secondhand smoke
Given the high compliance rates of the bans on smoking in public places in countries like Scotland , it is reasonable to predict that people will be just as law-abiding with a law that protects children from secondhand smoke in their homes . Part of the effect would deter parental smoking . They may not want to break the law and realize that it is a serious enough issue for childrens health that they should stop . Furthermore , friends , relatives and others who care about the health and well-being of children could be trusted to ensure that those flouting the new law would be highlighted to police . Other means of making enforcement workable would be to prohibit smoking in vehicles with children under age 14 , violations observed by traffic police could be handled like other vehicle-related infractions . After providing ample advance notice of the new laws start date , fines for violations in the home could be enforced , with each repeat violation receiving an increased fine . 	This law would work similarly to the laws banning smoking in public places , and could be just as effective .
Not being able to smoke in their home without risking punishment will make it much more difficult for parents to continue smoking , encouraging them to smoke much less or even give up altogether , which will improve their health . This can be seen in reports which show that there was a big decrease in the number of smokers in England after the ban on smoking in public places there , presumably because they didnt want to have to go outside all the time and be away from their friends every time they wanted to have a cigarette . Similarly , many parents will give up smoking to avoid having to leave their children every time they want to have a cigarette or risk being punished . 	Punishing parents for smoking around their children will encourage them to quit
Differences between different categories of prisoner are already accepted in the criminal justice system prisoners are generally kept in different conditions due to factors such as escape risk and other factors . For example the UK has open prisons which offer the freedom to move around within the prison and the system is aimed at reintegration so freedoms like alcohol are allowed , as are home visits . Once it is accepted that not all prisons and not all prisoners are treated the same then a difference in treatment based on the crime committed makes sense . If that is the case , it could be calibrated that those serving certain sentences for certain offences should be held in certain conditions for example , in Connecticut -LRB- a state that has abolished the Death Penalty so LWOP is the greatest penalty imposed -RRB- those serving life without parole are now denied contact visits and are given no more than two hours of recreation per day . James , Erwin , Why life in an open prison is no holiday camp , , 13 January 2011 , Blecker , p. 230 	Differences in treatment are already accepted
Worse prison conditions for particular offences would act as a deterrent . If people , in prisons generally and in society as a whole , see that those who are convicted of particularly bad crimes will be deterred from committing those worse crimes . If prison is simply a holding place that prevents people inside from committing crime then it is failing in creating deterrence ; criminals sometimes feel it is better to commit a crime when released in order to get back into prison . Katz , Levitt , and Shustorovich using death rates show how harsh prison conditions are likely to mean lower crime rates overall though a doubling of the death rate only reduces the crime rate by a few percentage points . Blecker , p. 68 Katz , Lawrence et al . , Prison Conditions , Capital Punishment , and Deterrence , , Vol .5 , No . 2 , 2003 , p. 340 	Harsher conditions are a deterrent
The dam will produce significant economic potential for Ethiopia In 2013 , Ethiopia had to import 125,000 metric tonnes of coal to fuel its power stations . Over 50 % of the countrys imports are orientated towards meeting its fuel demands . If Ethiopia can replace these imports with its own energy then it can make significant savings . The diverted money could be contributed towards development , which would be assisted by greater accessibility to electricity . In addition to this , 12,000 jobs will be created and Ethiopia will become an energy exporter . The excess energy from powering Africa will be enough to supply the surrounding region , making energy a viable export market for Ethiopia to tap in to . In combination with the greater access electricity dependent to income-generating activities , these factors give Ethiopia hope of a positive economic future . 	Economic benefits of the dam for Ethiopia
When the dam is in full effect , it should be able to provide the entirety of Ethiopias population with electricity . The United Nations Foundation placed access to energy as a high priority for developing countries , it enables access to key services and enables more income-generating activities . If Ethiopia discontinued the project , then they would deprive their citizens of economic and health security . Using energy from a dam will have its own benefits . The energy will be renewable source and will provide energy security for this developing state , thus justifying the project . 	The dam is predicted to provide energy for all of Ethiopia
GERD will have environmentally positive consequences for the region . The major environmental benefit is the clean and renewable energy source . There is an unlimited supply of electricity and the production of this energy does not contribute to global carbon dioxide emissions . Another environmental benefit is that the dam will reduce the chances of flooding downstream and drought , enabling the country to better combat climate change which is worsening these factors . Flood protection will prevent settled areas from being destroyed through rising river levels , benefitting Sudan and Egypt as well as Ethiopia . 	Environmental Benefits of the GERD
By including men in family planning programs and the decisions made concerning family structures equality is enabled . The decisions made , and responsibilities , concerning the family are no longer solely the burden of the woman . Men are provided with a voice , and therefore responsibility and obligation to act upon caring for the family . By introducing men into family planning a platform is provided enabling negotiations on the family to be discussed between man and woman . Men are key actors in decisions made ; therefore their inclusion is fundamental . This also means that the man is also much more likely to take on other responsibilities in terms of caring for the family or doing things the woman would have done in the past like collecting medicine -LRB- Wasswa , 2012 -RRB- . 	Gender equality in family planning
By including men fast action can be taken to control the size , and growth , of families . The patriarchal power structures mean men have a key voice in household decisions . Therefore the involvement of men in family planning is enabling perceptions of what the family should be to change . The cost of raising a family is realized , and intervening methods are being used to have fewer children . Family planning means planning how one can cope with having a child mentally , emotionally , financially , and physically , and sensitizing couples as to what kind of life standard they want . With the young generation of Ugandans a new culture of a smaller family can emerge . Men often have limited knowledge about family planning so it is necessary that they are included in learning and the transfer of knowledge -LRB- Kaida et al , 2005 -RRB- . When both partners are knowledgeable and involved family planning is far more likely to become a reality . Wasswa , 2012 . 	Involving men is the best way to ensure family planning works
There is a genuine value to a brand in part because , for clothing companies for example , it is a mark of quality as much as it is of origin . However even if that were not the case , the brand identity of a company is part of its legal property and should be protected in the same way and stock or cash against theft . The very fact that people are so keen to buy branded clothing and other products even when pirated demonstrates that there is a value to those brands . ACTA doesnt seek to control peoples rights to wear any pair of jeans or trainers or other type of product . It simply says that if someone wants to own Levi jeans or Nike trainers they should pay the price set by Levis or Nike . If they dont want to pay the premium then they are at liberty to buy different unbranded products . 	ACTA is needed to protect brands
In an age of such easy global communications , the threat of piracy is far greater for creative industries than it has ever been before . There is a huge difference between a few cheap video copies and global downloads available free of charge . With sites making movies that cost millions available for free , it poses a real threat to major studios . For example The Institute for Policy Innovation believes the global music industry loses $ 12.5 billion a year due to piracy resulting in 71,060 lost jobs . The fact that these sites are so popular demonstrates that music and movies are popular but that people are unwilling to pay real cost of producing that quality of product . The reality is that creative material is produced not just by a handful of millionaire actors and producers but by thousands of screen-writers , technicians and backroom staff ; all of whom have to be paid . To do that studios , music producers and publishers need some guarantee of a return on their initial investment . 	Piracy in an Internet age .
Becoming a vegetarian is an environmentally friendly thing to do . Modern farming is one of the main sources of pollution in our rivers . Beef farming is one of the main causes of deforestation , and as long as people continue to buy fast food in their billions , there will be a financial incentive to continue cutting down trees to make room for cattle . Because of our desire to eat fish , our rivers and seas are being emptied of fish and many species are facing extinction . Energy resources are used up much more greedily by meat farming than my farming cereals , pulses etc . . Eating meat and fish not only causes cruelty to animals , it causes serious harm to the environment and to biodiversity . For example consider At Torontos 1992 Royal Agricultural Winter Fair , Agriculture Canada displayed two contrasting statistics : it takes four football fields of land -LRB- about 1.6 hectares -RRB- to feed each Canadian and one apple tree produces enough fruit to make 320 pies . Think about it a couple of apple trees and a few rows of wheat on a mere fraction of a hectare could produce enough food for one person ! The 2006 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization -LRB- FAO -RRB- report concluded that worldwide livestock farming generates 18 % of the planet 's greenhouse gas emissions by comparison , all the world 's cars , trains , planes and boats account for a combined 13 % of greenhouse gas emissions . As a result of the above point producing meat damages the environment . The demand for meat drives deforestation . Daniel Cesar Avelino of Brazil 's Federal Public Prosecution Office says We know that the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon is cattle . This clearing of tropical rainforests such as the Amazon for agriculture is estimated to produce 17 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions . Not only this but the production of meat takes a lot more energy than it ultimately gives us chicken meat production consumes energy in a 4:1 ratio to protein output ; beef cattle production requires an energy input to protein output ratio of 54:1 . due to the same phenomenon of meat being inefficient to produce in terms of the amount of grain needed to produce the same weight of meat , production requires a lot of water . Water is another scarce resource that we will soon not have enough of in various areas of the globe . Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food . Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat . In comparison , soybean production uses 2,000 liters for kilogram of food produced ; rice , 1,912 ; wheat , 900 ; and potatoes , 500 liters . This is while there are areas of the globe that have severe water shortages . With farming using up to 70 times more water than is used for domestic purposes : cooking and washing . A third of the population of the world is already suffering from a shortage of water . Groundwater levels are falling all over the world and rivers are beginning to dry up . Already some of the biggest rivers such as Chinas Yellow river do not reach the sea . With a rising population becoming vegetarian is the only responsible way to eat . . 	Being vegetarian helps the environment
As evolved human beings it is our moral duty to inflict as little pain as possible for our survival . So if we do not need to inflict pain to animals in order to survive , we should not do it . Farm animals such as chickens , pigs , sheep , and cows are sentient living beings like us - they are our evolutionary cousins and like us they can feel pleasure and pain . The 18 century utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham even believed that animal suffering was just as serious as human suffering and likened the idea of human superiority to racism . It is wrong to farm and kill these animals for food when we do not need to do so . The methods of farming and slaughter of these animals are often barbaric and cruel - even on supposedly ` free range ' farms . Ten billion animals were slaughtered for human consumption each year , stated PETA . And unlike the farms long time ago , where animals roamed freely , today , most animals are factory farmed : crammed into cages where they can barely move and fed a diet adulterated with pesticides and antibiotics . These animals spend their entire lives in their prisoner cells so small that they ca n't even turn around . Many suffer serious health problems and even death because they are selectively bred to grow or produce milk or eggs at a far greater rate than their bodies are capable of coping with . At the slaughterhouse , there were millions of others who are killed every year for food . Further on Tom Regan explains that all duties regarding animals are indirect duties to one another from a philosophical point of view . He illustrates it with an analogy regarding children : Children , for example , are unable to sign contracts and lack rights . But they are protected by the moral contract nonetheless because of the sentimental interests of others . So we have , then , duties involving these children , duties regarding them , but no duties to them . Our duties in their case are indirect duties to other human beings , usually their parents . With this he supports the theory that animals must be protected from suffering , as it is moral to protect any living being from suffering , not because we have a moral contract with them , but mainly due to respect of life and recognition of suffering itself . 	It is immoral to kill animals
Almost all dangerous types of food poisoning are passed on through meat or eggs . So Campylobacter bacteria , the most common cause of food poisoning in England , areusually found in raw meat and poultry , unpasteurised milk and untreated water . Salmonella come from raw meat , poultry and dairy products and most cases of escherichia coli -LRB- E-Coli -RRB- food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef or drinking unpasteurised milk . Close contact between humans and animals also leads to zoonosis diseases such as bird flu which can be passed on from animals to humans . Using animal brains in the processed feed for livestock led to BSE in cattle and to CJD in humans who ate beef from infected cows . 	Being vegetarian reduces risks of food poisoning
The Seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small . It is twice the size of Washington D.C. , so smaller than many cities . As such finding enough land to relocate the country should not be a problem . Several of the states closest to the Seychelles ; Kenya , Tanzania , Somalia , and Madagascar , have plenty of land that they could give up without any inconvenience to their own state . Kenya , the smallest , is more than 1200 times bigger than Seychelles . 	Small size makes for ease
The President of Vanuatu has noted If such a tragedy -LSB- the disappearance of a state -RSB- should happen , then the United Nations and its members will have failed in their first and most basic duty to a Member and its innocent people , as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations . As long ago as 1992 developed nations accepted the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command and that polluter should , in principle , bear the cost of pollution . There is also a Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in which article 10 demands that any redrawing of borders must not render a person stateless , the principle behind which would equally apply to a disappearing state . The small island states are losing their countries through no fault of their own it is therefore the responsibility of other states to provide them with alternatives ; be this land or the resources to purchase land .

Hamas is a terrorist organisation , responsible for killing hundreds of civilians , often by sending suicide bombers into Israel . Both the European Union and the US State Department have recognised this by listing Hamas as a terrorist organisation . Their governments are barred by law from providing any funding to such groups . It is extremely worrying that such a violent organisation managed to win power in the most recent Palestinian election , and that committed terrorists are in government in Gaza and in control of the Palestinian budget and security forces . In 2007 both Western law , and the moral disgust at the thought that aid funding could be used to fund terror attacks , required the EU and US to stop funding the Palestinian Authority while under a Hamas government , the same would almost certainly be the case again if Hamas were to regain power . Schulenburg , John . Fatah Reconciles With Hamas . 27/04/2011 . 	The law prevents US and EU governments from funding terrorist groups .
It is clear what Hamas , or any other terrorist organisation , has to do in order to convince western governments to continue funding the Palestinian National Authority with it in charge . It must formally give up terror , accept the existence of the state of Israel and drop any anti-Semitic ideology . Yasser Arafats PLO and Fatah Party made these commitments in the early 1990s , and this allowed them to become negotiating partners in the Oslo Peace process . Hamas has to take the same steps if it wants to enjoy the same level of support from western donors which the previous Fatah government had . Until it makes these public changes , there would not be any funding . Schlaim , Avi . The Rise and Fall of the Oslo Peace Process . 2005 . 	Withholding funds will prevent PNA terrorism and anti-Semitism .
A terrorist organisation such as Hamas may be democratically elected , but that does not mean we have to fund its government . Respecting the decision of the Palestinian people is not the same thing as liking their choice or rewarding it with aid . The Palestinian people should realise that a vote for Hamas or any other terrorist organisation is a vote for international isolation . Showing our clear disapproval of terrorists in government sends a clear message for future elections both in Palestine and in other countries . 	The outcome of the Palestinian elections should not be rewarded with aid .
If top academics and those highly informed about the subject take issue with poetry , school pupils can not be expected to fathom it . On December 7th , 2007 , The Guardian , a British newspaper affiliated to the Left , noted that this ambiguous identity of poetry renders it very difficult to teach ; `` But until education theory asks itself what poetry itself is , and therefore what the teacher is trying to get across , poems will continue largely to figure as teaching aids , exercises and - for teenagers - increasingly tedious , somewhat arbitrary puzzles '' . The canonised poets and their poetry are concerned with adult life experiences , e.g . love , life , work , history and politics , solitude , loneliness , etc . . For this reason , widely acclaimed poetry is deep and requires an adult mind and mature emotional depth to understand , or at least draw something from , this famous poetry . 	Poetry is a notoriously difficult concept . It is a highly challenging subject to teach , for its identity as an art form is constantly changing and being debated .
It is like asking a student who can not count to solve a highly complex algebraic equation ; completely impossible because the groundwork remains a nemesis . If the pupils can not understand the basics of reading , writing and grammar , they will certainly struggle to with more complex concepts fundamental to the study of poetry such as similies , personifications , metaphors and extended metaphors . Let us take the UK as an example , for it is a country in which many students do not make progress in basic English . A report in 2011 voiced concern at the number of school children struggling with English and the published some horrifying statistics ; `` Hundreds of thousands of pupils are falling behind in the basics after starting secondary school , official figures suggest three in 10 are not making enough progress in English , according to Department for Education data .160,000 did not make enough progress in English . Press Association , Many secondary school pupils failing to meet expectations , report reveals , , 9 June 2011 , , accessed 1 September 2011 	In schools where many pupils are failing the basics of English language , they can not be expected to progress to a more complex level of English study like poetry before the basics have been mastered .
Given that the highly respected Royal Holloway University of London is one such institution that supports this , the future of poetry education and even poetry itself does not look hopeful . Sir Andrew Motion , Professor of Creative writing at Royal Holloway , University of London , specified that ; `` Poetry is a house of many mansions . It does pupils a disservice only to tell them things they already know . Rap has its own challenges and opportunities - but so do many other kinds of poetry , many of which are neglected in schools '' . Eminem has caused much offence and controversy over the years with his homophobic lyrics . This is just one example of why rap is not to be encouraged at all , let alone awarded a label of -LRB- so-called -RRB- `` poetry '' . Rappers like him must not be promoted as great artists in the classroom . It is unthinkable that rappers who promote gun crime , drugs and degrade women should be given a platform and even promoted in classrooms . These are simply not the values education can possibly support . 	The future of poetry teaching looks dismal . It is falling into disrepute by citing rappers as modern day poets .
In the UK , The Labour Party introduced The Literacy Hour , a programme that meant schools were obliged to dedicate more time to basic literacy -LRB- and numeracy -RRB- upon their election in 1997 . However , as the aforementioned statistics have shown , all that has increased is the number of pupils failing in this basic subject . There are 5 million illiterate people in Scotland alone . All we know is that more time does need to be spent learning the basic literacy and numeracy . Appreciating literature and poetry , the artistic side of the English language , can not be addressed until learners have fully understood and grasped the tools of reading , writing and vowel sounds that allow for fiction and poetry to be produced . We need an educational programme that recognises reading and writing as a matter of urgency and literary and poetry appreciation as a luxury in order to reduce the number of illiterate pupils . 	In countries where students are failing basic literacy , new measures to improve basic literacy skills in schools are required as a matter of urgency . In such cases , schools can not justify wasting time by teaching poetry .
Nationalism is a sense of fellow-feeling between group members . This promotes cooperation and social cohesion within the group . Nationalism and the identity it brings creates a social glue which binds otherwise different people together , that sense of social cooperation makes welfare , social security and medical programs much more likely and stronger . It also may make for a smoother political process when there is a solid basis for consensus . Those who are net contributors to the system need something to make them feel that what they are doing is worthwhile and in their interests ; something a national identity provides as it creates a sense of belonging that transcends economic interests . In Canada for example those who strongly identify with Canada are much more likely to support redistribution and healthcare than those with low identification with Canada . Societies with a healthy sense of nationalism are more likely to provide for each other and avoid the plight of poverty or poor health . 	Nationalism promotes cooperation and social cohesion
Nationalism has been a potent force for self-determination in colonial territories . The profoundly misunderstood Vietnamese independence movement , as well as most African liberation movements of the 1940s and 1950s drew heavily on the idea of nationhood to mobilise their people against a foreign exploitative power . Other examples include India , Indonesia , Guinea , and Guyana . Most often these states , once independence has been achieved , see a fracturing of nationalism that prevents those nationalist impulses from being used to condone violence against minority populations . Meanwhile in big multi-ethnic states , most notably India and Indonesia nationalism has been used positively to keep the state and its many ethnicities united my making a higher level of identity above the regional identities that in many other areas of the world would have become a national identity . 	National identity was necessary for independence
Nationalism can take many benign forms , such as that of civic nationalism , where a shared sense of national identity is created and reinforced by institutions , not ethnicity or history . The starting point of civic nationalism is not an ethnic group but the states territorial borders . It focuses on citizenship , civic rights and legal codes where all citizens are equal . Civic nationalism has taken firmest root in the United Kingdom and the United States . This is an inclusive kind of nationalism that accepts any individual into its institutions . Nationalism can provide cultural and political glue for strong democratic institutions that can win out over forms of ethnic exclusion or political repression . 	Not all nationalism is exclusive
In our highly mediated society we are bombarded with news and imagery of celebrities with many young people looking up to them as role models . Many of the most famous people which the public tend to look up to are Hollywood stars which regularly grace our cinema screens , there power to influence is great . A study by Dr Maltby shows that where previously parents , teachers and friends had the biggest influence on young people it is now more likely to be celebrities . -LRB- Cassidy , S. 2004 -RRB- If young people therefore see celebrities smoking on-screen , all be it while playing a character , they could be strongly influenced to start the activity themselves to emulate their role model . Allowing smoking on screen by celebrities , films and their directors are condoning , glamorizing and ultimately encouraging smoking . Banning smoking in films would strongly help in the fight against smoking as it would stop young adults copying their idols . 	Depictions of glamourous and famous people smoking could be seen as an endorsement of the habit
When smoking is used in films it is often portrayed positively without clearly demonstrating the bad effects it has . A study by Gunasekera , H. et al titled found that smoking was portrayed in 68 % of the films and that they ... tended to portray their use positively and without negative consequences . This normalization of smoking is hindering the effort to try and stop people taking up smoking , by regularly seeing the activity young people will consider the activity socially acceptable which gives the wrong message needed to help stop the activity and minimize health related problems from it . While films are most often fictional and produced for the purpose of entertainment people still do learn , whether rightly or wrongly , from them , it is arguably socially and morally irresponsible then for directors and films studios alike to show smoking in films without clearly demonstrating the negative side to it as it is painting an incorrect representation of what it is to be a smoker . 	The act of smoking is often portrayed postively in films
When various bans across different parts of the world began to be put in place on the advertising of tobacco products the companies behind them had to find both loopholes and alternative ways of advertising their product to both current but most importantly new potential customers . One way of continuing to advertise was to invest in product placement within film which many bans did not block . The ban on advertising in the UK was introduced in 1991 , by 1995 the instances of smoking in films had increased fourfold and the appearance of cigarette brands went up by a massive 600 % . -LRB- BBC , 1998 -RRB- A study by the American Lung Association also found after reviewing 145 movies ... that PG-13 movies contain more tobacco use than R-rated films intended for adults . and In a similar study the following year found that eighty percent of the popular PG-13 movies examined depicted tobacco use . -LRB- Media Awareness Network , 2010 -RRB- This clearly demonstrates that tobacco companies are using films to advertise their products , and particularly towards young children , this should be regulated . 	Tobacco companies may use movies to circumvent bans on advertising cigarettes
The European Parliament has a proportional representation system meaning that almost everyones vote counts but the change to a single constituency would still improve this . Everyones vote should count for the same no matter where they live . This system ensures that there is such equality in the voting for the European Parliament . From the 2014 elections Germany will have 96 MEPs and Malta 6 since Germany has a population of 82 million against Maltas 400,000 it has one for every 854,000 inhabitants against Maltas one MEP per 66,000 . Voters in smaller states have an outsize influence . Changing to a single constituency would make every European citizens vote worth the same .

States concerned with the protection and welfare of wild animals are able to close zoos , release the animals back into their natural habitats and thereafter enforce immigration regulation that would ensure they any live cargo entering the country would be searched and checked . If found to contain wild animals , they could be sent back to where they had arrived from and hopefully re-placed in their natural habitat . To cut supply would be inadvertently to reduce demand , and eventually ensure that the trade in live animals would cease , to the benefit of the wild animal populations themselves . 	States can have immigration regulations in place that protect and conserve the populations of wild animals
Animals belong in their natural habitat , in the wild . It is a breach of their natural rights to take them by force into captivity for our own purposes . They are ` prevented from gathering their own food , developing their own social orders and generally behaving in ways that are natural to them . ' No matter how we may try to replicate their surrounding in a zoo , we will never achieve the full result . Predators need to hunt and taking from them their ability to do so by taming/caging/drugging them is beyond cruel . A study by the journal Science in 2008 found that ` Asian elephants in European zoos had a median lifespan of just 18.9 years compared to 41.7 years for wild elephants in an Asian logging camp . ' Excessive human involvement in the food cycle has disrupted it considerably . Let nature take its course . 	Wild animals belong in their natural habitat
Adults and children visiting zoos will be given the subliminal message that it is OK to use animals for our own ends , however it impinges on their freedom or quality of life . Therefore zoos will encourage poor treatment of animals more generally . People do not go to zoos for educational reasons they simply go to be entertained and diverted by weird and wonderful creatures seen as objects of beauty or entertainment . Dale Marcelini , a zoo curator in Washington , conducted a study that found ` visitors spend less than 8 seconds per snake , and one minute per lion . ' Otherwise , ` most people preoccupied themselves with eating , resting and shoppingpeople treated the exhibits like wallpaper . As a form of education the zoo is deficient : the only way to understand an animal properly is to see it in its natural environment the zoo gives a totally artificial and misleading view of the animal by isolating it from its ecosystem . 1 . Berhaupt , 2011 	Zoos encourage the use of animals as mere entertainment
Whatever the good intentions of zoo-keepers , animals in zoos suffer . They are inevitably confined in unnaturally small spaces , and are kept from the public by cages and bars . A study of British zoos found that elephant enclosures were 1000 times smaller than their natural habitats . Wild polar bears are confined ` in spaces that are more than a million times smaller than their arctic territory . ' They suffer psychological distress , often displayed by abnormal or self-destructive behaviour . Aquatic animals do not have enough water , birds are prevented from flying away by having their wings clipped and being kept in aviaries . Furthermore , the locations of zoos in urban areas leads to incidents like the fox attack at London Zoo in 2010 that killed 11 South African and Rockhopper penguins . 	Wild animals in zoos suffer unnecessarily
Social networking websites have proven to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophiles . Teachers are already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their students . Being allowed to communicate with students via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who wants to start an inappropriate relationship with a student , by giving him virtually unlimited access to the students after school . In fact , many such relationships do involve some form of electronic contact1 . By banning this form of communication , the law would make it harder for teachers with bad intentions to carry them through . 	Electronic communication facilitates sexual misconduct .
Access to a teachers private information and photos may lead to weakening her position as an educator . How can a teacher convincingly speak against smoking or substance abuse if students have access to pictures portraying the teacher themselves drinking or smoking ? For example , a principal from the Bronx , who had been trying to impose a strict dress code at her school , was branded a hypocrite by her students when a risqu photo of her was found on her facebook page . And even if the teacher will be careful not to post anything inappropriate on her page , a friend or acquaintance might thereby undermining the teacher . A strict separation of personal and professional life would prevent such incidents from happening . 	Teachers personal life might undermine educational message .
According to Carol Shakeshaft an expert in sexual misconduct by teachers : -LSB- e -RSB- ducators who use social media for personal and intimate conversations and contact are not much different from those who spend their time hanging out with students at the beach . You have to ask why a teacher would do this . The honest answer is that it rarely has anything to do with student learning . Interacting with ones teachers the same way as with ones friends , sharing personal information , can only erode the respect and distance that a teacher needs in order to be an authority figure and a mentor for her young charges . Even if such friendships were entirely innocent , they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher-student relationship to put considerable strain on the teachers role as educator and their ability to do the job . 	A teacher-student relationship is not one between friends or equals .
It is very difficult for a child to realize that he is being groomed ; they are unlikely to know the risk1 . After all , a teacher is regarded as a trusted adult . But , if the child is aware that private electronic contact between teachers and students is prohibited by law , the child will immediately know the teacher is doing something he is not supposed to if he initiates private electronic contact . This will therefore act as an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what is going on . 	Acting as a warning signal for children at risk .
Many types of cases intrinsically have long periods of time during which evidence arises . For instance , in cases of child molestation , there is often an evidence may be suppressed due to long term institutional failings , protracted familial abuse or continued proximity between an offender and an isolated , intimidated victim . Children may be reluctant to speak out against individuals who are held in high regard in their communities , or they feel embarrassed about what has happened to them . There also exists the possibility of repressed memory , where the brains of the individuals who were abused actually cause them to forget such a traumatic event occurred until years later , often well into adulthood . 	Many types of cases , like child molestation , intrinsically have long periods of time during which evidence arises .
Removing statutes of limitations will provide a significant boost to the indirect deterrence power of laws , since a significant number criminals take into account factors like the likelihood that they will be apprehended , likelihood that they will be convicted , and sentencing when deciding whether they will commit crimes . Although not all criminals act with this degree of rationality , those that do are often responsible for the most damaging and pernicious forms of crime - organised violence , drug dealing and institutional abuse - They are rational actors . Currently , if criminals evade prosecution until the statute of limitations is up , they will get away with the crime . They also therefore have perverse incentives to suppress evidence or pay off witnesses until the limitation period expires . 	Removing statutes will boost the indirect deterrent presented by criminal laws .
DNA evidence is advancing steadily and will aid in prosecution . The justice system will be able to consistently produce fairer and more robust outcomes if the state enables conviction of criminals years after their crimes . Furthermore , even if it is not advancing significantly in terms of the methods we use at any given point , it is likely that the current methods we have will be streamlined and eventually go down in cost . This means poorer jurisdictions can afford to utilize DNA analysis for the purposes of collecting evidence . Right now , there are thousands of rape kits sitting in evidence lockups in the police stations of less affluent districts . If we can access more of those , we can significantly benefit justice . 	DNA evidence gathering is advancing and becoming cheaper ; using DNA evidence in prosecutions will lead to more just outcomes , even years after the commission of a crime .
Prosecutors are the appropriate individuals to determine which particular crimes are most damaging to the community , and how resources should be allocated . They have the greatest amount of exposure to criminals -LRB- particularly repeat offenders with whom they may be familiar -RRB- and the methods that can be used to punish and rehabilitate them . Limitations statues should be repealed to give prosecutors more flexibility , in pursuing and investigating crimes . For instance , even if a low-level criminal who committed grand theft auto with a statute of limitations of three years is no longer a real threat , threatening him with prosecution might cause him to give up friends he knows who committed more relevant , more recent crimes . Trading a plea bargain for those dangerous and actively criminal associates is good for the community , but can not be accomplished if we can not prosecute the car thief in the first place . 	Prosecutors are the appropriate individuals to determine which crimes to prosecute in order to keep the community safest .
There is a global increase in gun ownership , even in countries which did not traditionally think of themselves as having a large criminal gun culture . Presently 1.8 million legally held guns are accounted for in the UK . This increases the risks to frontline police officers of being the victims of gun crime . Police officers should have a right to protect themselves . Fewer officers may die on duty if they were better able to protect themselves . Arming the police is essentially a matter of self-defence rather than being actively involved in regular firearms incidents . This is shown by the fact that most routinely armed police never fire their weapon on active duty in their whole career . If being a police officer is a safer job , then there will be a larger applicant pool to choose from , and thus better , more qualified police forces . 	Policing is a dangerous job . Police officers should be allowed to arm themselves
Most countries in Europe and North America have armed police forces , in part to deter criminal acts , but also to protect officers working in an armed or dangerous environment . Armed criminals operate in at least some areas of virtually every jurisdiction . Given this reality , a failure to routinely arm the police gives armed criminals a strong advantage in terms of their ability to threaten and commit violence , without any corresponding risk to themselves . In Bristol in England where police are not routinely armed the deployment of armed police in inner-city areas in 2003 defused gang tensions and reduced crime enough to allow the armed police to be withdrawn again . Only putting armed police in for brief periods will only have a short term impact , having permanently armed police is the only way to keep this deterrence in effect . A world-wide meta-study of armed police patrols found some evidence that in high violence areas , targeted armed police patrols could chill down the tensions and reassure the community but the evidence was not very compelling and the authors acknowledged that such a sticking plaster approach was no long term solution to urban violence . 	An armed police force will deter criminal behaviour
Armed police reassure law-abiding citizens at a time when gun-related crime is increasing in most European countries and parts of North America . In the UK 28 gun crimes are committed every day . Much public opinion holds that something must be done to tackle this . The sight of armed police officers patrolling the streets will not only deter gangs from harassing residents , but will instil in communities a confidence that they are being properly protected . Gangs are not interested in fighting the police ; they are more concerned about attacks from other gangs in their area who are willing to break the law and attack them unprovoked . People feel safer when they see armed police , especially if they perceive them as a response to a heightened risk . Thus , for example , police officers at British airports routinely carry sub-machine guns , although there is no evidential pattern to suggest that this high-visibility weaponry offers any situational strategic advantage over a more subtle arming . 	Arming the police makes communities feel safer
The old-fashioned notions of friendly neighborhood unarmed policing reflect the aspirations of a different age . As armed violence has increased sharply in parts of the developed world , the police need to redefine their role so that it is a more appropriate response to contemporary problems . In the UK , for example , gun crime almost doubled in the decade to 2008 , while the rise in London gun crime has tripled , the police need to be able to respond to this . There is also danger in being a state with unarmed police when others states have armed police forces . The unarmed nation may be seen as a soft touch compared to other regional nations . This can encourage an importation of criminality . 	The police should be equipped to react to contemporary social problems
Police officers are routinely armed already in a variety of situations . This is a small step , as police officers are routinely armed already in a variety of situations , e.g . at airports and when providing security for political leaders or institutions . As mentioned earlier armed police have even been used before on routine patrols in areas where there has been gun crime . Already rapid-response units of armed officers are available to deal with armed criminals , but these need to be specially summoned and authorised . Often , they arrive too late to do any good . The next obvious step would be to have many more police armed so as to make this response much faster . 	Arming the police is a necessary step
At the moment the response to cyber-attacks has essentially been nothing . It is however clear that some response is needed as without a reaction there is no deterrence ; the attacks will keep coming until something is done . The number of cyber-attacks and the sensitivity of the information stolen have been increasing over recent years and as more and more work is done online and more and more systems are connected to the Internet so cyber-attacks become more attractive . There needs to be a deterrent and the best deterrent is to make sure that such attacks are costly . As these attacks are usually cross border -LRB- and in this debate we are only concerned with cross border attacks -RRB- then the only way to create a cost is through sanctions . These sanctions can either hit the assailant directly or else hit his government so encouraging them to crack down on hacking emanating from their country . It should be remembered that China argues that it does not launch cyber-attacks meaning that any such attacks from China must duly be private . If this is the case then sanctions are the best way of prompting internal law enforcement . Sanctions therefore encourage all nations where there are cyber criminals to make sure they take such cyber-crime seriously . If they do not get their own cyber criminals under control then they may be affected by sanctions . China Daily , China denies launching cyberattacks on US , , 20 February 2013 , 	There needs to be action to deter more cyber attacks
Cyber conflict favours the offence ; when the defender is successful they gain nothing and impose no harm on the attacker who is free to try again elsewhere . The attackers are free to attack until they get past the defences somewhere . That the attacks dont risk lives helps to encourage an offensive mindset as makes it seem like there is no downside to attempting to dominate your opponent . This means the only cyber response is to attack the attacker so that the same advantages apply . The result is that cyber-attacks have a very real danger of long term tension or escalation . If one side is losing a conflict where both sides are attempting to steal the other 's intellectual property -LRB- or the other has little to steal -RRB- the response may be something like the stuxnet attack that involves physical damage , this then would probably be considered an illegal use of force creating a thin line between a cyber-war and a real war . When the cyber war involves physical damage as the US has warned there then may be a military response . Sanctions are a way to apply pressure without this risk of escalation into a military conflict . Lin , Herbert , Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace , , Fall 2012 , p. 51 Rothkopf , David , The Cool War , , 20 February 2013 , Zetter , Kim , Legal Experts : Stuxnet Attack on Iran Was Illegal Act of Force , , 25 March 2013 , 	Sanctions will prevent escalation in cyber conflict
Cyber-attacks pose a distinct problem for international diplomacy in that they are difficult to prevent and difficult to respond to . Any kind of military response as the United States has threatened would be completely disproportionate against all but the very biggest of cyber-attacks -LRB- those that actually result in deaths -RRB- , diplomacy on the other hand is as good as no response , if the response is simply a tongue lashing then the benefits of cyber espionage will be far higher than the cost . The only proportionate , and therefore just , response to a cyber-attack is sanctions . The sanctions can be used to impose a similar economic cost on the offending state as that caused by the cyber-attack . This would be just like the World Trade Organisation 's dispute settlement rules . They allow for the imposition of trade sanctions to a similar value to the losses being experienced as a result of protectionist action , with the sanctions sometimes on differing sectors to those where there are unfair trade practices . Alternatively sanctions could mean a proportionate Internet response ; users from the offending nation could be prohibited from using Internet services , for example an attack by hackers on the US could result in people from that country being blocked from Google and other US internet services .

The ability to access the wealth of knowledge being generated in the developed world would greatly impact the ability of students and budding academics in the developing world to develop their human capital and keep abreast of the most recent developments in the various fields of academic research . Lag is a serious problem in an academic world where the knowledge base is constantly developing and expanding . In many of the sciences , particularly those focused on high technology , information rapidly becomes obsolete as new developments supplant the old . The lag that occurs because developing countries ' academics and professionals can not readily access this new information results in their always being behind the curve . Coupled with the fact that they possess fewer resources than their developed world counterparts , developing world institutions are locked in a constant game of catch-up they have found difficult , if not impossible , to break free of . By subsidizing this translation effort , students in these countries are able to learn with the most up-to-date information , academics are able to work with and build upon the most relevant areas of research , and professionals can keep with the curve of knowledge to remain competitive in an ever more global marketplace . An example of what can happen to a country cut off from the global stream of knowledge can be found in the Soviet Union . For decades Soviet academics were cut off from the rest of the world , and the result was a significant stunting of their academic development . This translation would be a major boon for all the academic and professional bodies in developing countries .

Communication in academia is necessary to effectively engage with the work of their colleagues elsewhere in the world , and in sciences in particular there has become a lingua franca in English . Any academic without the language is at a severe disadvantage . Institutions and governments of the Global North have the resources and wherewithal to translate any research that might strike their fancy . The same is not true for states and universities in the Global South which have far more limited financial and human capital resources . By subsidizing the translation of academic literature into the languages of developing countries the developed world can expand the reach and impact of its institutions ' research . Enabling access to all the best academic research in multiple languages will mean greater cross-pollination of ideas and knowledge . Newton is supposed to have said we stand upon the shoulders of giants as all ideas are ultimately built upon a foundation of past work . Language is often a barrier to understanding so translation helps to broaden the shoulders upon which academics stand . By subsidizing the publication of their work into other significant languages , institutions can have a powerful impact on improving their own reputation and academic impact . Academic rankings such as the rankings by Shanghai Jiao Tong University , and the Times Higher Education magazine include research and paper citations as part of the criteria . Just as importantly it opens the door to an improved free flowing dialogue between academics around the world . This is particularly important today as the developing world becomes a centre of economic and scientific development . This translation project will serve to aid in the development of relations between research institutes , such as in the case of American institutions developing partnerships with Chinese and Indian universities .

It is often the case that science and technology produced in the developed world finds its greatest application in the developing world . Sometimes new developments are meant for such use , as was the case with Norman Borlaug 's engineering of dwarf wheat in order to end the Indian food crisis . Other times it is serendipitous , as academic work not meant of practical use , or tools that could not be best applied in developed world economies find ready application elsewhere , as citizens of the developing world turn the technologies to their needs . By translating academic journals into the languages of developing countries , academics and governments can open a gold mine of ideas and innovation . The developing world still mostly lacks the infrastructure for large scale research and relies heavily on research produced in the developed world for its sustenance . Having access to the body of academic literature makes these countries less dependent on the academic mainstream , or to the few who can translate the work themselves . Having access to this research allows developing countries to study work done in the developed world and look at how the advances may be applicable to them . The more people are able to engage in this study the more likely it is that other uses for the research will be found . Global Health Innovation Blog .

The original values of the Labour party were the common ownership of the means of production , distribution , and exchange and even today the Labour party aims to serve the public interest as well as to create a just society , which judges its strength by the condition of the weak as much as the strong , an open democracy , in which government is held to account by the people , and a healthy environment . In the last parliament Labour supported there being a cap on welfare spending . More recently Labour abstained on a Conservative welfare bill that many felt was too harsh in its cuts . Corbyn , and a move to the left , will bring Labour back to its core values rather than supporting Conservative policies and austerity that harms individuals .

The public are totally turned off by a style of politics which seems to rely on the levels of club house theatrical abuse that you can throw across at each other in parliament and across the airwaves . This style is necessary to extentuate the small areas where there are differences between the parties . Introduce real differences on the big issues of government , particularly the economy and society , then such minor point scoring fades into insignificance . Wintor , Patrick , Corbyn : its time for a new kind of politics , , 12 September 2015 	Lack of difference encourages Punch and Judy politics
Since the start of the 1990s Labour has moved to the right to contest the centre ground of politics . This worked in 1997 when the Conservatives were a spent force after 17 Years in power . Tony Blair successfully stole the conservatives moderate policies . However this has resulted in the centre ground moving to the right with policies such as austerity and welfare cuts becoming a consensus . Labour needs to move left to fight on their own ground forcing other parties to match their more populist policies such as renationalising the railways . 	Presents a bold new path
The current economic crisis within Europe masks its immense success in turning new member states into prosperous economies while also benefiting those who were already members . Between 1999 and 2007 trade between the new and old member states grew from 175 billion Euros to 500 billion , this outweighs the cost of EU financial assistance to the new members which only amounts to between 0.2-0 .3 % of EU GDP . For example British exports to the 12 new member states were worth 11.6 billion in 2009 compared to 4.5 billion in 1999 whereas the Dutch government estimates that the benefits of enlargement to each of its inhabitants was 650 Euros . Admitting new members is also necessary over the long term in order to counter the aging that is occurring in Europe . Every member of the European Union has an aging population and a fertility rate below the replacement rate of 2.1 . Encouraging economic growth in countries that are old and getting older is difficult because they are less inclined to take risks and be innovative . This means that Europe needs more young workers ; these can be gained either through immigration from the rest of the world or through admitting more vibrant economies into the European Union . Turkey is a good example of the kind of country the EU needs to allow to join ; its economy is growing rapidly , even faster than Chinas in the first half of 2011 , and the median age of the population is still only 25 . 	EU expansion is good for current members economically .
Expansion means extending a project which has ensured unprecedented levels of peace and cooperation among former enemies in western Europe for nearly half a century . This was the original purpose of the European project . The European Union started out as the European Coal and Steel Community which shared these important strategic resources that were necessary to fight a war . It was argued that this integration is the only way to keep France and Germany , enemies that had fought three wars in the previous eighty years , from attacking each other . Entrenching peace , democracy and economic integration throughout the continent is to the benefit of all European nations , the most recent two wars ; World War I and World War II expanded to include the whole of Europe and much of the rest of the world . The European Union also means that there is no concern that there will be conflict . This both allows members of the European Union to spend less on defence only the UK , France and Greece meet NATOs 2 % of GDP target and frees up European forces for Peacekeeping missions such as those in the in the western Balkans in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia , but also further afield , for example 3700 troops were deployed as an EU force in Chad in 2008-9 . 	EU expansion is good for current members politically .
Due to the impotence of the Afghan state and its fledgling armed forces , withdrawing by the timetabled date would most likely mean abandoning the project of building a successful Afghan state , a project which can be successful if NATO troops continue to play their vital role in it . It is a myth that Afghanistan is unconquerable or ungovernable . The level of violence in Afghanistan is actually far lower than most Americans believe . In 2008 more than 2,000 Afghan civilians died at the hands of the Taliban or coalition forces -LRB- almost 7 per ten thousand -RRB- . This was too many , but it was also less than a quarter of the deaths in 2008 in Iraq , a country that is both more sparsely populated and often assumed to be easier to govern . Not only are Afghan civilians much safer under American occupation than Iraqis , they are also statistically less likely to be killed in the war than anyone living in the United States during the early 1990s , when the U.S. murder rate peaked at more than 24,000 killings a year -LRB- about 10 per ten thousand -RRB- . An assertion that deserves a similarly hard look is the argument that nation building in Afghanistan is doomed because the country isnt a nation-state , but rather a jury-rigged patchwork of competing tribal groupings . In fact , Afghanistan is a much older nation-state than , say , Italy or Germany , both of which were only unified in the late nineteenth century . Modern Afghanistan is considered to have emerged with the first Afghan empire under Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747 , and so has been a nation for decades longer than the United States . Accordingly , Afghans have a strong sense of nationhood , and building a state there is possible so long as NATO forces do not abandon the project before it is completed . A successful Afghan state is in the interests of all NATO countries , for security reasons , and so a compelling reason to abandon the timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan is that building a successful Afghan state is entirely possible if NATO stays the course and only withdraws once the job is done . Bergen , Peter . `` Winning the good war . Why Afghanistan is not Obama 's Vietnam '' . Washington Monthly . July/August 2009 . 	Keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan is necessary for creating a successful Afghan state
The timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan means withdrawing by the end of 2012 , regardless of the security situation , and handing over the conflict against the Taliban and Al Qaida -LRB- which will almost certainly still be going on -RRB- to a largely Afghan force which is ill-prepared to handle the war on its own . This means that proponents of the timetable withdrawal must support pulling NATO forces out of Afghanistan even if the war is going badly at the end of 2012 and it is clear that the withdrawal will benefit the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the battlefield . `` Afghan forces simply do not currently have the capacity to do the protecting themselves at this point and , given the challenges of building up new institutions in Afghanistan after decades of war , will not necessarily have the ability until by the end of 2012 . US and NATO forces are needed to mentor and partner with Afghans as they build up an army and police force largely from scratch . Withdrawing before this task is completed adds up to a prescription for a drying up of intelligence and a Taliban victory . If the Taliban were thus to come to power in Afghanistan after the timetabled withdrawal , al-Qaeda would not be far behind . The USA 's top nemesis would be able to salvage a victory in the very place from which it launched the 9/11 attacks eight years ago . Al-Qaeda would have its favourite bases and sanctuaries back , as well as a major propaganda win . This defeat for the West in Afghanistan would embolden its opponents not just in Pakistan , but all around the world , leaving it open to more attacks . The West has a security interest in preventing the region from slipping into a maelstrom of conflict . Pakistan , with 170m people and nuclear weapons , is vulnerable to the Talibans potent mixture of ethnic-Pushtun nationalism and extremist Islam , as its state power is tenuous . Anarchy in Afghanistan , or a Taliban restoration , would leave it prey to permanent cross-border instability . Therefore success in Afghanistan is key to the security in Pakistan . The US has even more reasons to care about the security of Pakistan when the India-Pakistan conflict is considered , especially as both sides of this have nuclear weapons . India and Pakistan have come within a hairs breadth from nuclear conflict twice over Kashmir . If Pakistan were to fall apart , it would potentially leave nuclear weapons and a large military in the hands of extremist Muslim groups , which could lead to a regional war with India . It is a compelling and vital American interest to prevent nuclear conflict in South Asiawhich makes fixing Afghanistan in some way also a vital American interest , even if this means keeping the troops there past the timetabled withdrawal . The War on Terror can not be won if the US and NATO pull out of Afghanistan and rely more simply on offshore military resources . During the 1990s , when the US tried to go after Osama bin Laden without access to nearby bases by using ships based in the Indian Ocean , the two - to four-hour flight times of drones and cruise missiles operating off such ships made prompt action to real-time intelligence impractical . Since 1979 , the US has been involved in a long , complex conflict against Islamic extremism . It has fought this ideology in many ways in many places , and it is uncertain now how this conflict will evolve . However the US should understand that the conflict is unavoidable and that when extremism pushes , it is in the US and NATO 'S long-term interests to push back and that eventually , if they do so , extremism will wither . The timetabled withdrawal from Afghanistan could mean withdrawing before this struggle has been won , and handing a base for exporting terrorism to the Taliban and Al Qaeda . Security comes before other state interests , largely because the rights of all citizens depend on their security first , and so the security dimension here is key . Therefore , in order to protect the security of the US and other NATO countries , the timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan should be abandoned , and the troops should remain there until the job is done .

The US overthrew the Taliban in the winter of 2001 . It has a moral obligation to ensure that when it does leave Afghanistan it does so secure in the knowledge that the country will never again be a launching pad for the worlds deadliest terrorist groups , and that the country is on the way to a measure of stability and prosperity . Withdrawal before this has been achieved would amount to a terrible betrayal of the Afghan people , some of whose troubles are the result of Western intervention . Millions of refugees have returned and millions of children have the chance to go to school . But the West has failed to protect civilian lives , to bring the development it promised , to wean the economy off its poppy-addiction and to ensure fair electionsand failed even to agree about what it is trying to do in the country . Locally , NATO forces have done fine and heroic work . But too often the best initiatives are dropped when the best commanders end their tours . The Afghan conflict , it is often said , has been not an eight-year war , but eight one-year wars . NATO comes off worse each time . US and NATO forces should persist in Afghanistan because they can do much better in terms of helping Afghanistan , and because they have a moral obligation to do so . It should be remembered that , for the Afghan people , a return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance , international isolation , a paralyzed economy , and the denial of basic human rights to the Afghan people - especially women and girls . The return in force of al Qaeda terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence . The US and NATO have a moral obligation to prevent this , and to not withdraw until the future of Afghanistan is secured . Bergen , Peter . `` Winning the good war .

The Middle East is a tinder box at the best of times . Having an unpredictable megalomaniac sitting in the middle of it was dangerous , not only for Iraqis but for other peoples in the region . Hussain was a danger to the Middle East as he had proved many times , through his invasion of Iran which was followed only a couple of years later in 1990 by an invasion of Kuwait which sparked the Gulf War and his use of scud missiles on Israel which was otherwise uninvolved in the conflict . It was better to remove this threat than risk being drawn into a multi-player conflict when he next attacked a neighbor . 	His removal provides stability and security not only for Iraq but for the Middle East as a region
It 's important to be clear that this debate is looking at the results of the Iraq war and , by any definition Iraq is in a much more stable and secure position than it was in 2003 when American , British and other international troops arrived in the country . Whatever one thinks of the initial justifications for the war there is no doubt that the country , the region and the world are better and safer places without Saddam Hussein . It is easy to criticize the allies but it is worth bearing in mind that the alternative was leaving in power a man who had committed genocide was a vicious and brutal dictator under whose regime extra-judicial execution and detention , mass-murder and torture were commonplace . 	Saddam Hussein is gone and Iraq is now functioning as one of very few democracies in the Middle East
Without intervention there is little doubt that Saddam or one of his still more murderous sons would be running Iraq . Even though there were no WMDs , it seems reasonable to assume that neither Saddam nor his sons would have ignored Irans attempts to secure fissile material and develop a bomb . Iraq had attempted to build a nuclear reactor in the 1970s but it was destroyed by Israel in 1981 and Iraq and Iran had fought a far for most of the 1980s for political dominance in the Gulf and the Shiite , Sunni religious divide . So we would now be watching an arms race in the Middle East between the two with Israel on a hair trigger . This wasnt just about removing one tyrant ; the regime had dynastic ambitions , and a failure to act would have created the equivalent of North Korea . However , this particular hermit kingdom would have been sitting on top of the second largest reserves of oil in the world . It would , therefore , have the capacity to create the sort of fear and chaos Kim Jong Il can only dream of . 	Although there has been a huge cost in human life the alternatives may well have been worse Saddam had made quite clear his intention to hand over power to his sons
`` The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic . '' Shouting fire in a crowded cinema when there is no fire , and you know it , is wrong because doing so creates a clear and present danger of harm to others . Likewise , in the US -LRB- and many other countries -RRB- there is no protection for false commercial speech -LRB- i.e . misrepresentation -RRB- and the contents of adverts can be regulated in order to ensure that they are truthful and do not deceive consumers . On that basis , restrictions can be placed on how tobacco products may be advertised , and people may be prevented from promoting illegal and fraudulent tax advice . 	The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done
The Government must protect its citizens from foreign enemies and internal enemies - thus freedom of speech can be acceptably curtailed during times of war in order to prevent propaganda and spying which might undermine the national interest . This has happened in almost all states during times of war , during the second world war the United States even had a government department dedicated to it ; The Office of Censorship . 	It may be necessary in the interests of national security
Information and Communication Technology -LRB- ICT -RRB- is now a normal part of modern life , used by everyone from toddlers to pensioners . So children need to grow up making use of technology such as mobile phones if they are to be able to fully participate in contemporary society . The average age at which children get their first mobile phone is eight according to a recent study . To prevent a child from having a mobile phone at that age is to put them at a clear social disadvantage compared with their peers . Mobile phone use develops skills for the modern workplace with its need for tech-savvy employees with communication skills and the ability to work flexibly . In any case , children often have better phone manners than adults they are less likely to shout into the phone , more likely to text discreetly , and more aware of text and phone etiquette . Such manners are the direct consequence of familiarity with the device and an understanding of appropriate use in certain contexts . 	Children should be comfortable with modern technology
Education is as much about the growth in character and dealing with risks as it is the accumulation of knowledge ; mobile phones provide for children a means to converse with peers , develop friendships and resolve disputes , all within minutes of each other , night and day . For them , getting a cell phone is a step towards independence and a status symbol among their friends . The confidence and self-esteem derived from having a mobile phone can not be underappreciated , as proven by the corresponding negative impact of losing ones phone . An Independent study in 2004 found that 55 per cent of people cited keeping in touch with friends or family as the main reason for being wedded to their handsets ' . Furthermore , the increasing potential of smart phones facilitates the accessing of information in real-time and on the move ; a determined child with a grasp of the potential of their mobile phone can illuminate themselves on matters like directions to destinations , opening times for activities and immediate weather forecasts . With such information , children can begin to reason with each other and make decisions without resort to more mature advice . 	Mobile phones encourage the development of independence and interpersonal skills
Mobile phones keep children safer , as it is easier for parents to stay in touch with their children and for children to contact someone in an emergency . Through calls and texts , parents can know where their child is and be reassured that he or she is safe , all the while their children know they are never more than a phone call away from help . As Leslie Sharpe argues , I wanted to ensure that they had a way of contacting me in an emergency . It is , however , true that some children carrying the most sophisticated or Smart phones are more susceptible to being robbed , but thieves are always after something new . Phones now are both much more widespread and security coded , so the benefits to thieves are no longer as great or immediate . Traffic accidents that are the result of children being distracted by their phones while walking across roads should be blamed on bad safety education rather than on the actual phones . Ultimately , mobile phones provide parents and young people with peace of mind and children with a safety net in emergencies , whether calling parents or the emergency services . 	Mobile phones keep children safe
All technological platforms have the potential to be abused or act as a negative medium , what is important is that children are taught to use their mobile phones responsibly . Schools should introduce programs and classes that teach children not only how important the devices are to their personal safety , but also how to exploit the advantages of the software . All children with sufficiently smart mobile phones should know how to find out where they are at any given time using map functions , and how to use the internet to find information on the go but to be vary of revealing their location to others and possible commercial exploitation of certain location based services . This advice should be taught alongside warnings about the limits of mobile phone technology , ensuring that the children dont trust them blindly but use them as verification tools or means of starting enquiries . What should emerge is an environment where phones can be used as teaching tools and facilitating social cohesion rather than simply being a distraction in class . 	Schools can implement programs to encourage responsible and considerate mobile phone use
All the Security Council members know that at some point there is going to have to be reform of the council . This will most likely mean more members being admitted to the Council . The three countries whose grasp on the Security Council is tenuous due to their relative power having declined ; UK , France and Russia , will likely be willing to give up their veto in order to retain their seats . The United States and China would then have to follow or face the rest of the international community and devalue the United Nations . A half-way house would probably be agreed where the veto could be retained in a few areas much as it has been within the European Union decision making process . This could then be slowly eroded over time . 	The Security Council knows it has to reform .
Purported U.N. actions that would clearly antagonise a member of the P5 never even reach the Security Council ; such is the awareness that the veto would stall its progress . The statistics of the numbers of vetoes passed at any particular point in UN history does not reveal the true defect of the institutional arrangement . In an attempt to circumvent this , countries and military alliances are forced to act unilaterally . NATO initiated military action against Yugoslavia , under the imprimatur of the United States and the United Kingdom , without receiving Security Council authorisation . It had become evident that any UN military involvement would be vetoed by both China and Russia . Furthermore , the silence of the Security Council whilst Russia launched a relentless and brutal campaign against Chechnya was deafening . Nevertheless , there is little that can be done such is the absolute power of the veto that Russia and the other P5 members have . 	The veto power is a barrier to discourse , preventing the U.N. from acting where the majority of its member states want it to .
Funding contributions to the United Nations should directly relate to the influence that member organizations thereafter have on its actions ; with the veto in place , this is no longer the case . The Permanent Five , as the group of nations granted the most constitutional power in the United Nations , should contribute a proportional amount of resources to the institution . Initially , this was the case however , by 2004 , Japan was contributing 19 per cent of the UN budget , second only to that of the United States -LSB- 1 -RSB- . In third place , contributing 8 per cent , was Germany , another state lacking a veto power and any ability to overrule the interests of P5 nations , all bar one of whom contributed less to the UN budget -LSB- 2 -RSB- . Furthermore , India and Brazil , whilst not contributing financially to the degree of Japan and Germany , have permitted large swathes of their armed forces to join U.N. peacekeeping operations to fulfil the mandates handed down by the Security Council . Despite these financial and military contributions , the states concerned get no greater say in the interests and actions of the organization . A fairer , more equitable model would insist on a greater proportionality between ones contribution to the United Nations and ones ability to influence its actions . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Blum , 2005 -LSB- 2 -RSB- ibid 	The Permanent Five no longer contribute to the United Nations to a degree expected of their special status .
In the rare recent circumstances in which the veto power has been utilised , it has been hijacked by ideological demands and petty national interests . The P5 are able to use their veto powers not to enforce legality , justice and transparency in the international environment , but rather appease their allies and punish their enemies . China prevented peacekeeping operations proceeding in Guatemala and Macedonia on account of the engagement of those countries with Taiwan . The veto is no longer applied for the maintenance of collective security , but the substantiation of internal security . 	The veto is wielded as an ideological tool .
The permanent five -LRB- P5 -RRB- were given this privilege for two reasons that have no application in the post-Cold War world . Firstly , the Allied powers , with the addition of China , sought to bind themselves to the UN organisation that was designed to prevent the depredations of the Second World War ever recurring . Secondly , the P5 held unrivalled strategic might through their possession of nuclear weapon technology or imminent nuclear capacity . Yet , the UN is no longer in any danger of imminent collapse . The P5 will abandon neither the organisation nor the cause of global peace by loss of the veto power . Moreover , the global power balance has shifted dramatically since 1945 ; the P5 ` do not reflect the geopolitical realities of today ' . Nuclear proliferation has accelerated in the past decade , such that inter alia India , Pakistan , North Korea , Egypt , Iraq and Iran are developing inter-continental ballistic capacity . 	The veto power is an anachronism that does not suit the contemporary international society and it 's power relations .
Many states in the modern world do not respect the rights of minorities or actively seek to dilute and subsume them into the majority culture . Others offer limited protections to minority peoples but stop short of allowing them to choose their own futures . We need to reassert their right to self-determination to ensure that these minority cultures are not lost . Failure to defend the principle of self-determination now will effectively close off the choices of future generations . For example , Australian government policy for many decades was to ignore Aboriginal rights , denying them full citizenship and removing children from their homes and relocating them with white families -LRB- the so-called `` stolen generation '' -RRB- . As a result many indigenous Australians no longer have a strong link to their native cultures and languages . The same is arguably true in places like Tibet , where traditional culture is being diluted over time through the deliberate policy of the Chinese government . 	Self-determination is necessary to protect minority cultures .
Many modern nation states are the product of historical accident or hurried decolonisation processes that did not properly take account of ethnic or religious differences between peoples in the states that resulted . Examples can be seen all over the world but especially in Asia , Africa and the former Soviet Union , where postcolonial or post-Cold War boundaries separate people from their kin against their wills . Other territories may be disputed between one or more nation . Allowing ethnic or religious groups self-determination may help to reverse the harmful effect of artificial , poorly-drawn borders . If self-determination is universally accepted -LRB- and applied -RRB- by the international community as a key principle in such disputes , they may in future be easier to resolve . Two examples ; Kashmir , which straddles the line of partition drawn up by the British when granting independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 ; and the Falkland Islands , which are the object of dispute between the UK and Argentina , including a brief war in 1982 . History , law geography all offer competing and incompatible views of who should rightfully own these territories . If we recognise the principle of self-determination as key , however , it is clear that it is the view of the inhabitants that should decide its future . Indeed , if this principle is ignored , such disputes will rumble on for many years to come . 	Self-determination offers a way to resolve otherwise intractable disputes .
Modern liberal democracy is founded on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leaders and their own futures , but not all states give their minority peoples such a right . However , this is a right guaranteed under international law . The International Court of Justice has held that this right applies not just to national governments but also people . The two important United Nations studies on the right to self-determination set out factors of a people that give rise to possession of right to self-determination : a history of independence or self-rule in an identifiable territory , a distinct culture , and a will and capability to regain self-governance . If these criteria are in place , such peoples should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangements . Critescu , A. and GrosEspiell , H. `` The Right to Self-determination '' , United Nations , 1980 -LRB- not online , but widely cited 	Self-determination embodies the fundamental right of peoples to decide their own futures .
In some contexts , separation may not be a realistic option for minority peoples . However , that does not mean that self-determination is not meaningful for such groups . For indigenous peoples , self-determination may take the form of restitution for land that was stolen from them , or compensation and reparations . Furthermore , self-determination may take the form of political autonomy , or greater rights to decide how children are educated , or parallel systems of justice such as sharia courts . Self-determination is about representation and identity and choice - not about outcomes . 	Self-determination and independence is recognition of the fact that indigenous peoples were unfairly treated by colonial powers , and their proprietary rights abused .
The constituents peoples -LRB- Serbs , Croats and Bosniaks -RRB- live almost entirely in separate segregated areas with very little communal intermixing . They already essentially live in separate states but without the ability to actually direct their own affairs or receive international recognition . It should be remembered that the Bosnian Serbs have already voted ponce for secession as in a referendum in November 1991 in areas which were Serb ethnic 96.4 % voted for an independent State within the then Yugoslav federation . Wikipedia , Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Application of Genocide convention , Dissenting opinion of Judge Kreca , International Court of Justice , 11 July 1996 , p. 738 , 	The peoples within the state have no desire to live together .
Where groups of people do not identify with the state they are less likely to be willing to invest in more generous state services since they do feel that peoples with whom they have no affinity will benefit from them . Conversely , where people feel like the state is mostly composed of people like them , they are more willing to invest in education , healthcare and a welfare state . These things will ultimately significantly improve the lives of the people in each new state and lead to stronger states than the one that exists now . For example the Scandinavian states , Norway , Denmark , Sweden and Finland with their largely homogenous societies are also associated with very high levels of social happiness and generous welfare provision . 	Increased sense of identity with the state increases social solidarity .
The right to self-determination is a basic human right which underpins the legitimacy of the nation-state . Where a large group people do not feel represented or accepted by a state and thus do not consent to its rule , the states control over that people becomes illegitimate . The right to national self-determination is enshrined with the UN charter and formed the basis for the independence of Slovenia , Croatia , Macedonia , Kosovo and Montenegro . United Nations , UN Charter , Chapter I : Purposes and Principles , Art . 1 , Part 2 . 26 June 1945 , 	Serbs have a right to Self-Determination .
The existing state structure does not work , because it requires agreement between the representatives of RS and the FBH , Given the fundamentally divergent aims and opinions of the two sides compromise is almost impossible leading to perpetual gridlock on basic issues such as policing and education .

The wealth from oil , or other natural resources , holds back democratization as a result of the resources curse or paradox of plenty . Resources provide money , and money is what is needed to run a security state . When money can come from natural resources there is little need to tax the people , instead it becomes a rentier economy where the dictator has resources to buy support without recourse to taxation . It is essentially the opposite of the well-known idea no taxation without representation ; if the money comes not from taxes but from oil what need is there for democracy ? This proposal takes away the option of having access to large oil revenues instead providing only a limited amount to the state rather than the pockets of the dictator . This prevents the buying of key groups such as the army and the policy who can be used to repress the population . It is not by chance that the only countries in the Arab Middle East that could be considered democracies before the Arab Spring never had oil ; Jordan and Lebanon . Michel Chatelus and Yves Scehmeil , Towards a New Political Economy of State Industrialisation in the Arab Middle East , , Vol . 16 , No . 2 -LRB- May , 1984 -RRB- , pp.251-265 , pp.261-262 	Oil wealth flowing to politicians discourages democracy
Environmental damage is an example of the tragedy of the commons where if a resource is not owned by an individual -LRB- or is free to all -RRB- then it will be overexploited . This is because it is in everyones self-interest to use it as much as possible . The result is pollution ; politicians and oil companies want to exploit the oil as cheaply as possible so they dump pollution on the local population . For example , the $ 19 billion ruling handed down last year by a court in Lago Agrio , a town near Ecuadors border with Colombia , held Chevron accountable for health and environmental damages resulting from chemical-laden wastewater dumped from 1964 to 1992 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . Putting oil wealth into a trust fund can help prevent this kind of abuse . There are two reasons for this . First if politicians are not getting an immediate benefit they will be less inclined to overlook pollution and there wont be money to buy support for drilling and pollution to continue . The second is that since the fund is meant to provide long term benefits and investments one of the things it can be doing is being devoted to cleaning up any pollution that is created thus protecting the future generations . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Joe Carroll , Rebecca Penty & Katia Dmitrieva Chevrons $ 19 Billion Disaster Gets Hearing , 29 November 2012 , 	A fund would prevent pollution
NATOs primary objective in Afghanistan is to enable the Afghan authorities to provide effective security across the country and ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists . The invasion of Afghanistan was initially about destroying al-Qaeda and with the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 in Pakistan this objective has been met . There are still efforts to destroy al Qaeda but these have mostly moved out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan and other countries such as Yemen . NATO has also brought Afghanistan to the point where the Afghanis can look after themselves and exercise their own security . On 18 June Afghanistan took over the lead from NATO on security nationwide having previously been taking control district by district . Handing over security also itself improves security with Afghanis in Kandahar saying Now that the foreigners are gone , the security situation in the city and in the districts is much better . 	NATO has brought peace and security
Some of the biggest benefits of the NATO occupation have been through the increase in democracy and human rights . While these were not specific aims of the NATO mission they were among the goals set out by the United Nations . There have been two Presidential elections , one in 2004 the other in 2009 , and two parliamentary elections , 2005 and 2010 none have been perfect but it is a clear advance from no elections at all . The most notable human rights increase has been in womens rights . Under the Taliban Afghanistan strictly limited the activities of women but today 27.3 % of the representatives in the Parliament are women -LRB- better than in the UK or US -RRB- and the first female governor is in office . The literacy rate is still low but they now make up 36.6 % of those in primary school up from almost nothing . There have been similar gains in other human rights such as a reduction in the use of corporal punishments such as amputating hands for theft . 	Democracy has been brought to Afghanistan
The rehabilitation of Afghanistans infrastructure has not been an immense success due to the continuing bombing campaign which inevitably damages infrastructure but there have been big economic benefits from the NATO presence . There have been more than 4,000 schools built and 175,000 teachers trained , although more is needed this is an immense boost to education in Afghanistan . Another benefit of increased stability is a renewal of outside investment , from China in particular . China has been investing billions , Several mining firms have made a $ 4.4 billion investment in one project ; an immense undeveloped copper reserve in Aynak . In total there is more than $ 20 billion being invested in infrastructure by Afghanistans Asian neighbours , as these investments are looking for profit they are clearly believed to be sustainable , by comparison the United States has only funded $ 1.6 billion since 2006 . 	Investment in Afghanistan ; rebuilding the economy
NATO is also ensuring that peace and security remain in Afghanistan as they draw down by opening up negotiations with the Taliban . Peace can only be assured by bringing together the sides so that almost everyone accepts the status quo and does not want to destroy that status quo through force . United States officials say We have long said this conflict wo n't be won on the battlefield with the deputy national security advisor , Ben Rhodes , adding The United States will be supporting a process that is fundamentally Afghan-led meaning that NATO is no longer key to the process . NATO handing over control to the Afghans and eventually withdrawing entirely will make peace more likely to succeed as the Taliban considerers it its religious and national duty to gain independence from the occupation with this goal it wants to support a political and peaceful solution . Lasting peace is then only possible when NATO leaves . 	Negotiations to ensure lasting peace
Deforestation is often used as a tool for leverage in politics . Frequently this involves collusion between the exploiters and government or the bribery of officials responsible for enforcement of conservation regulations or for the protection of reserves . Corruption often begins at high levels and continues all the way down the government hierarchy . Even if corruption is not outright in terms of bribes , logging companies may seek concessions , low fees and taxes , or the waiving of international regulations in return for offering governments a percentage of the revenues from the sale of the wood . Governments then use the revenues gained from this deforestation for political gain , either through feeding some of it back into society or by providing the newly created land to landless migrants . In a more sinister example , logging was used by the Khmer Rouge to fund its civil war in Cambodia . Governments in tropical countries often feel that exploitation of natural resources is an opportunity for economic gain . For instance , in the 1980 ? s , Malaysia , Indonesia and The Philippines exported 85 million cubic meters of wood -LRB- 4 % of the global wood supply -RRB- , worth about $ 3 billion , which has since grown to be one of their main industries . This gives the government credibility as an economic force for good , though the sacrifice is sustainability and a condoning -LRB- even encouraging -RRB- of illegal logging . And an indefinable amount of the profits are siphoned off into the private funds of some government officials , unbeknownst to the population . As a result , since the 1970s , around half of Cambodia 's forests have disappeared . 	Logging is often used as a political tool by corrupt governments
Rainforests are responsible for 28 % of the world 's oxygen turnover , which is why they have been labelled the ` Lungs of the Earth ' . Their role in maintaining breathable air is vital as the world population continues to increase exponentially . The rainforests are also a key carbon sink ; they are thought to limit the greenhouse effect of global warming by absorbing and storing carbon , hence reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . Rainforests help to offset global carbon emissions . `` To get an idea of the value of the sink , the removal of nearly five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forest , based on realistic prices for a tonne of carbon , should be valued at around 13 billion pounds per year . This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests '' . In addition , it has been calculated that 12 % -14 % of global carbon emissions come from the deforestation of rainforests in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia . 	With global warming high on the international agenda , rainforests are a vital carbon sink which help to balance the atmosphere
Deforestation has long-term environmental impacts . There is a causal connection between deforestation , loss of biodiversity and climate change . Rainforests are the most diverse habitats on earth ; they cover only 6 % of the land surface of the world but scientists estimate they have over 50 % of the earth 's plants and animals . Experts estimate that we are losing 137 plant , animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest deforestation : that equates to 50,000 species a year . Moreover rainforests are not unproductive habitats . Not only are they aesthetically pleasing , they are also socially and economically important . They have many plants that are used in medicines . For example , the US National Cancer Institute has identified 3000 plants that are active against cancer cells ; 70 % of these plants are found in the rainforest . Indeed , 25 % of the active ingredients in today 's cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in the rainforest . There are still many plants to be discovered that could further aid medical research . If we lose this biodiversity , we will lose our ability to utilise these species for our own benefit and the benefit of future generations on Earth . 	Uncontrolled deforestation has a profound negative environmental impact and results in significant loss of biodiversity
A ban on unsustainable logging is possible by creating sustainable alternatives . Regulation can protect forests . In the U.S. , the State of California , the federal government and Pacific Lumber Company reached agreement to protect the Headwaters forest . The agreement bans logging in certain areas so as to protect Headwaters ' eco-system . Pacific Lumber can log 425,000 cubic metres in specially-protected buffer zones . Where sustainable logging is difficult Governments should find alternatives to logging wilderness forests , including alternative fuel sources and genetically engineered trees . In Africa , poverty is the main source for deforestation . Poor people can not afford alternatives fuels and must fell trees to make fire . By prohibiting logging , governments will create an incentive for the development of alternative fuel sources . Scientists are developing genetically engineered trees . They either grow faster or have improved quality wood . The biggest obstacle to full-scale development of genetically engineered trees is public opinion and money . Logging companies and governments have no incentive to invest in research and development of these trees as long a virgin forests remain . 	A ban would be possible because there are alternatives
By prosecuting perpetrators , justice creates a deterrent . The deterrent effect , as accepted in criminal law generally , is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again . If those who committed atrocities get away with it they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence . If Sharon was prosecuted for his crimes in the 50s , would he have gone on to have the same political career ? He would likely not have had the chance to allow the Sabra and Shatia massacre or Operation Defensive Shield . The career of Laurent Nkunda is a good example of this ; he fought in the Tutsi group that took control of Rwanda in 1994 ending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both Congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion , only now after 14 years as an army commander is he under arrest . Clearly Nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace .

Elections only come around every four years or so , allowing unethical or incompetent politicians to do a lot of damage in office before facing the judgment of their constituents . And after three years or so , many voters may have forgotten about their offending behavior , allowing them to get away with it . In any case , regular elections seldom focus on the record of one particular candidate for a legislature , but are a referendum on their party as a whole . If their party remains popular , or if their seat is a safe one , then incompetent and unethical politicians will often be re-elected regardless of their personal failings . Such was the case in California , where immediately before the recall , Gray Davis -LRB- a Democrat -RRB- was re-elected simply because the local Republican Party had self-destructed . 	Elections every four years are not enough to ensure representation .
People today are apathetic and distrustful about politics , which is very unhealthy for a democracy . Low turnouts in elections mean that governments today lack moral authority . Giving people more direct control would create more interest in politics , and get more people educated and active about the issues that affect them . In other words , allowing recall elections will help to restore faith in politics and encourage active citizenship . Enabling ordinary voters to sack unsatisfactory representatives will give them an incentive to monitor what their politicians are doing in office , and will encourage the media to cover legislative affairs more fully than they do at present . 	The possibility for recall fosters citizen participation in politics .
Having a recall mechanism focuses the minds of elected representatives and ensures that they keep the interests of their constituents constantly in mind . Not only will this lead to harder working politicians with higher ethical standards , it will also prevent them selling out to lobby groups and party whips . All too often elected representatives give way to the lure of business as usual in the capital city , and forget the folks who sent them there in the first place . A system which provides the opportunity for a recall will give voters more power than what they currently have cast a ballot once every four or five years . For the reasons outlined above , i.e . that voters may simply lack quality of choice in election time , giving them the ability to demand a recall decreases the democratic deficit . 	Recall mechanisms ensure leader accountability .
Let us not forget that is with the consent of the public that these security measures are taken , CCTV for example was a populist measure that has often been considered a threat to civil liberties . It is in line with democratic ideals ; the majority of the country wants greater security . For example in 2005 59 % of Americans wanted the Patriot Act extended . And because democracy embodies all those values we are fighting for freedom and equality included - we must adhere to a democratic spirit when deciding on how to organise ourselves or else risk falling into the same mind-set as those terrorists themselves . 	It is with the popular support of the public that security measures are taken .
Negative cases of security abuse are few and have been greatly exaggerated by an emphatic civil rights lobby that has no empathy for the victims of terrorism . Of course , with any wide-scale attempt to fight terrorism there are bound to be a few cases of abuse of security measures . For example in the UK terrorism suspects were originally detained without charge under the Anti-Terrorism , Crime and Security Act however the detention was declared unlawful by the law lords in 2005 so the government introduced new scaled back policies such as control orders . Therefore government has always been willing to scale back its security legislation when the courts believe it goes too far . Nonetheless it is not a good idea to shut down all security measures under a pretext that they violate rights . The majority of the measures are intended to safeguard those civil liberties instead of abusing them . 	The apparent loss of liberty is overstated .
It would be incredibly disingenuous of the opposition if they did not concede that the dangers are great and that something must be done . Because , deep down , everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives . It is of course , the governments primary duty to protect citizens but this can only be done with the loss of some civil liberties . These liberties will of course still be completely protected by the courts . When it comes to the issue of life and death , it is the propositions hope that a few civil liberties would be only willingly given up by any prudent citizen . 	The argument is about practicality and the balancing of risks .
Terrorism is part of the modern world and is inextricably linked with the rise of modern communications , the internet , and a global community . This is an age in which space and time are bending to the tune of new media information at your fingertips may sound nice , but for those who want to destroy , it only makes their object easier to attain . And so more strict national security measures must be employed in order to keep up with the enemy . Escalation is the name of the game imposed on governments around the world by terrorists for example the Mumbai terrorists used GPS systems to guide them into Mumbai , attacks were coordinated on cell and satellite phones and Blackberrys were used to monitor the international reaction . In order to keep up states need new powers to stop , deter , and prevent terrorism . The government needs to secure state-security first ; only then can the debate on civil liberties begin , and only then . 	National security is something that must be protected even at the cost of civil liberties .
The USA is at present far better than most countries in their respect and regard for civil liberties . New security measures do not greatly compromise this liberty , and the US measures are at the very least comparable with similar measures already in effect in other democratic developed countries , e.g . Spain and the UK , which have had to cope with domestic terrorism for far longer than the USA . The facts speak for themselves the USA enjoys a healthy western-liberalism the likes of which most of the worlds people can not even conceive of . The issue of the erosion of a few minor liberties of -LRB- states like the USs -RRB- citizens should be overlooked in favour of the much greater issue of protecting the very existence of that state . 	Western countries already benefit from extremely liberal laws .
he criminologist Peter Moskos observes that most of us , if given the choice , would opt to receive ten lashes rather than spend five years in prison . Paradoxically , a significant number of us would condemn corporal punishment as barbaric and inhumane . If imprisonment is a more rational response to criminal behaviour , why would so many rational individuals opt to receive corporal punishment ? Contemporary prisons are the result of a failed utopian experiment . They serve no useful rehabilitative purpose , and exist only to fulfil a common desire to punish deviant behaviour and to segregate criminals from the public at large . Prisons harm inmates and obstruct attempts to reintegrate them into society . It may be necessary to incarcerate certain compulsive and habitually violent criminals , but for a majority of offenders , prison only serves exacerbate underlying social , economic and psychological problems that lead to criminality . Using corporal punishment to reduce or replace custodial sentences would provide an effective way to fulfil the social need to punish criminals , while removing the harmful externalities of mass incarceration . Strictly supervised whipping or caning can adequately and proportionately express societys anger with the criminal , while avoiding the dangers of long-term incarceration and reinvigorating the use of rehabilitation . In the United States , the UK and many European countries , prison populations have increased dramatically , but reductions in rates of offending have been minimal or non existent . In the absence of funding , or coherent , centrally administered rehabilitation strategies , prisons have become places devoid of productive activity . Prisoners are not encouraged to address the causes of their offending , or to acquire skills that will help them to live independently in society following their release . Boredom , overcrowding and under-staffing have led to the emergence of gang - and drug-cultures in many prisons . Inmates incarcerated for minor offences quickly become complicit in gang violence , or fall prey to alcoholism and drug addiction . Gang associations and chemical dependencies carry over into inmates lives once they are released . The prison system serves only to breed criminality , not to cure it . The cost of incarcerating the average offender in the United Kingdom is estimated to be 45000 a year . Reduced spending on incarceration can be used to fuel an increase in spending on detoxification , rehabilitation and restorative justice schemes . Moreover damaging effects of prison will not cancel out the positive effects of rehabilitation . The physical injuries resulting from whipping , although painful , are less severe than the subtler damage wrought on inmates by imprisonment . 	Flogging harms offenders less than imprisonment
The failures of the prison system are tolerated within political culture and by the public , partly because the privations of the prison environment are seen as a suitable punishment for criminal behaviour . Deprivation of liberty and the emptiness of criminal life are seen as retribution for criminals dishonest or violent activities . Politicians dare not confront the damaging effects of imprisonment for fear of being labelled as soft on crime . There is greater political cache to be gained from introducing policies that prolong prison terms , and remove judges discretion to order non custodial sentences . Novel approaches to the problem of criminality are seen as signs of political weakness . The use of monitored corporal punishment will keep offenders who have not committed serious crimes out of the prison system . At a nominal rate of five lashes for every year of incarceration , flogging will serve as a clear demonstration of societal disapproval , satisfying popular conceptions of retributive justice . Once the need to punish is satisfied , policy makers will be free to institute new rehabilitation schemes that address the root causes of criminal behaviour ; these schemes can be set up without sacrificing political capital or appearing to prioritise the rights of criminals over victims or the public . 	Prison reform is politically unachievable
A custodial sentence is capable of destroying the relationships and livelihood of an offender . Imprisonment means that an offender will be unable to work and will lose his job , if he has one . Statistics sourced from the Pew Foundation indicate that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a black , male American securing a job by up to 57 % . The isolation inherent in imprisonment can lead to the breakup of marriages and to the decay of relationships between parents and children . The stigma associated with a custodial sentence may result in an offender being shunned by his friends , his family and his community . He will , in effect , be left with no sources of support once he is released . A former inmate will be left with no incentive to adjust his behaviour and disengage with criminality . The Pew Foundation notes that 43 % of offenders in the United States were returned to prison within three years of release . The long-term damage done to an offenders life is not an intended consequence of custodial sentencing . However , it can not be claimed to be a proportionate response to crime , as it affects both serious offenders and those accused of non-violent offences such as burglary or fraud . The decay of an offenders relationships and social support structures is yet another harmful externality of custodial punishment . A corporal sentence caters to the social imperative to punish criminals , but it also allows offenders to remain with their families and to avoid financial hardship by remaining in employment . In Moskos own words , corporal punishment allows society to express its disapproval quickly and efficiently , leaving the offenders to move on with the process of reform . It is in the interests of any effective system of rehabilitation to ensure that a non-violent offender remains in contact with their family and remains in employment -LRB- excepting , of course , offenders who have attack or abused family members -RRB- . Families , spouses and social networks can play an important role in supporting and encouraging an offender to engage with rehabilitation programmes . Wives and children can effectively monitor an offenders behaviour when trained staff are unavailable , integrating the reform process with the offenders day to day life . 	Custodial sentences make recidivism more likely
The European Union is not able to protect women in other countries that are not a part of the union . Countries that have legislation discriminating against women are clearly not listening to European urgings on human rights . They will not respond to these urgings social and cultural traditions are deeply ingrained and only slowly change . Where women are seen as second-tier citizens it is seen as a natural part of the society can barely walk to the corner of the street without the consent of their husband . Moreover , the situation in countries with legislated discrimination against women is not improving , in countries which were previously secular there is increasingly a challenge from Islamism as in Libya and Egypt during the ` Arab Spring ' . Moreover the influence of the European Union is declining ; it has always been primarily financial , through aid which is declining , and through investment which , at least in the MENA , region has reversed as a result of those same revolutions . By granting asylum we can help them escape a legal system that clearly is against them and replace it with a European Union legal system that grants them those rights they never had .

There is a moral obligation for such a powerful and diverse group of nations to protect not only their own citizens but also people in desperate need all around the world . All the countries in the EU have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and therefore stand behind its principles . As the world biggest economic power the EU is fully capable of doing so . The Union is wealthy enough that it can take in the extra migrants that would occur as a result of taking in women from countries where they face discriminatory legislation . The European Unions international image is not based on its military might but upon its economy and on being upstanding in its promotion of a human rights agenda . Granting asylum to women that live under discriminatory legal system reinforces this image of being concerned for human rights . The European Union has signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by which signatories agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women while the convention is calling for the elimination of discrimination internally it is fully in the spirit of the convention to undertake actions that encourage others to fulfill the Convention . By being willing to grant asylum to women from countries that have not lived up to the standards of the convention which includes To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures , including sanctions where appropriate , prohibiting all discrimination against women the European Union will put pressure on these regimes , helping to highlight their unequal systems .

Sometimes , women who are persecuted by their government end up running from their country just to be sent back from the EU when their asylum application is rejected . Under the current legal system , the problems of women from countries that implement Sharia Law and other forms of discrimination are often not considered sufficient grounds for asylum . This is because refugees are only considered to be refugees owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , so it does not include persecution for gender . The consequences can be of two kinds . The first and the worst is sending them back home where to face harsh punishment for trying to leave . This was the case with two women who applied for asylum in Great Britain in 1997 and were denied this right even though they faced death by stoning upon return . Even if the women are not sent home immediately due to a prolonged appeals process they are left in detention centers , in uncomfortable conditions and unable to get a job or do anything while they wait . Those who are denied entry are left with nothing only a long depressing wait to be returned to the horrible conditions from which they thought they had escaped .

Everyone is equal . Women who live under legal system that permits discrimination against them are being denied of basic human rights whether this is the right to vote , to a fair trial , or bodily integrity . Sharia Law , for example , clearly denies them human rights like equality before the law , a basic human need according to Universal Declaration of Human Rights . '' '' Under Sharia a womans testimony is worth half a mans and she gets half the inheritance of her male siblings . Second of all , bodily integrity is affected when women are stoned to death or beaten by their husbands without them even being punished . The importance of self-determination and autonomy are neglected in Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to drive or go alone in public . Female genital mutilation , which causes bleeding , infections and infertility , and is almost always done without the girl 's consent , is a big problem in many African countries . Asylum given by the EU shall be the only way for these women to leave the system that persecutes them and be able to have their human needs respected and therefore creating a healthier , safer and better environment .

Women who are constantly threatened by their husbands or who are in societies where they are considered to represent less than a man will most certainly lack ambition to achieve their full potential or even if they do have the ambition will be restrained from fulfilling it . When you live under a system that considers you inferior to the other gender and denies you opportunities on the basis of gender sometimes including education the individual is clearly never going to have a chance to make their life worthwhile for its own sake . They wont be able to take up jobs that will have an impact on the world , they wont control their own economic circumstances as their husband is the only breadwinner , and they will be denied the opportunity to express their ideas and views . By giving them asylum in a place where women and men are treated equally , we give them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted to do before . Besides the security that they will gain , they will be able to go to school or get a job more easily than in their native country . There is no reason for which we dont want these women to be a part of our European cultural identity . It is shameful to give this opportunity only to your citizens when women from countries that discriminate against them might be able to contribute so much more than they are able to under their circumstances in their native country . 	We would allow discriminated women to reach their full potential
The minority populations of both of the early states are relatively low , and this can impact on the outcome of their primaries . Minority populations - such as African and Latino Americans - and migrants who have been granted citizenship will approach the issues at the heart of a presidential campaign from a different perspective . Due to high levels of social and financial deprivation among minority populations throughout the US , African Americans are likely to vote in a way that reflects concern about laws and policies that regulate access to educational subsidies and state supported health care . Latino voters may have strong familial ties with south American nation states . Correspondingly , candidates positions on cross border trade and the enforcement of immigration laws are likely to influence the voting decisions of Latino Americans . There have been a number of solutions proposed to this , including the rotation of first primaries around the country . However , all this does is replicate the problem in new and imaginative ways ; every state will have its own demographic abnormalities . Questions of educational aspiration and social mobility among black voters in South Carolina can not be compared to the debates surrounding community integration and immigration in Arizona . The only way to take a vote that is representative of the nation as a whole is to ballot the nation as a whole . The whole purpose of the resolution is to eliminate or control for statistical and demographic inequalities that may give certain candidates an advantage unrelated to the popularity of their policies . A national primary would apply this principle but within the context of the American model of party affiliation . 	The current system disenfranchises minorities as Iowa and New Hampshire have disproportionately low Black and Latino populations
As most primaries only serve to decide the number of delegates who will be bound to vote for a particular candidate at a partys national convention , a presidential hopeful will be able to ignore contests later in the election cycle if he has already secured a majority of delegates . The staggered nature of primaries under the status quo allows candidates to determine when their lead has become unassailable . As a consequence , candidates will refrain from mounting campaigns in states that poll later in the election cycle . The later a state votes , the less chance it has of influencing the size of a candidates majority . In 2000 and 2004 , by the time New York the third most populous state in the union voted , both main parties had , in effect , selected their candidate . If that isnt the perfect example of an undemocratic system , then it would be difficult to think of what might be . The current system discriminates against lesser known candidates who are already at a disadvantage . The advantage of running all primaries during a single day in February is that it would allow lesser known candidates the time to introduce themselves to the nation . A promising but little known candidate can easily be taken out of contention during the Iowa , New Hampshire or South Carolina primaries . Running a single primary in February or March would give unknown candidates a full three months to mount their own media campaigns and to build up the press contacts and public profile that established candidates already enjoy . A single primary election would also do a great deal to help with a more even distribution of donations between the candidates . The primaries effectively function as part of the general election campaign ; they are certainly central to selecting the two people from whom the eventual winner will emerge . It is therefore damaging and deceptive to continue to treat them as a purely party-political issue that has no relevance for voters who are not closely involved with the republican and democrat campaign machines . A final argument concerns the role of political capital and states influence over candidates activities . Campaigning compels candidates to offer party members and voters in states incentives in return for their endorsement . These may take the form of pledges to address local issues , to provide funding to public projects or to pursue policies at a national level that are beneficial to certain states . However , states that are excluded from the primary process when a candidate secures a majority of delegates will be unable to win promises or concessions from a presidential hopeful . This creates inequalities in the ability of individual states to influence federal policy and governance , reducing the cohesiveness of the union as a whole . 	The current system is undemocratic as it gives undue influence to the early states
Immense pressure is placed on candidates to win in the early primaries and then to deliver repeat performances across key states . Each stage of the process is effectively a national campaign and has to be treated - and funded - as such . Even though votes in primaries are limited to the citizens of individual states , or the members of state parties , the media can communicate a poor showing in the polls or a blunder in a debate to the entire nation . The overall cost of running campaign adverts , researching a candidates position on a huge range of local issues and organising rallies , debates and press briefings can quickly become astronomical hence the need to establish as decisive lead as early as possible . A single national primary would both reduce costs and provide for a clearer result . Moreover , a single national primary would compel candidates to mount campaigns based around positive policy statements and direct involvement in issues local to states . The role of attack campaigning - aimed at undermining opponents with an early lead - would be de-emphasised . To give these practical benefits some context we should consider the 2008 campaign for the democratic party nomination . By the end of primary season , Obama and Clinton between them had raised nearly a quarter of a billion dollars . Obama won on paper , but the campaign had been dominated by the differing perspectives of two figures who would go on to be President and Secretary of State . It can hardly be in the interest of party of national unity to know that the Secretary of State thinks the President lacks the experience to receive a late night phone call concerning an international crisis . 	The current system is hugely expensive ; a national primary would control the scale of spending in campaigns
A federal Europe will be more advantageous for individual citizens , since they will be living in a powerful state , yet with respect of their cultural and local situation Subsidiarity combines maximum effectiveness with maximum accountability , with decisions being made at the lowest appropriate level . Citizens gain the advantages of living in a large , powerful state in terms of international economic , military and political power , all available more cheaply in a state of 450 million people , and through their increased opportunities for work , study , etc . . Yet the advantages of living in a smaller state are preserved in terms of connection to the political process , respect for local cultural traditions and responsiveness to differing economic and physical situations . Such checks and balances prevent tyranny and increase willing obedience to laws . Overall , we now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the European level . EU political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organisation . The challenge facing the European Union in the future is to fill the gap between itself and the citizen , providing a political connection equal to the social , cultural and sporting connections that the single market has already provided . Federalism and subsidiarity can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not e.g . for Northern Ireland , Corsica , Basque Region , Lombardy . In a Federal Europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures . 	A federal Europe will protect the cultural diversity of its member states
A federal Europe will be better equipped to promote the interests of its citizens in the world , carrying more influence in the UN , WTO , IMF and other intergovernmental and treaty organisations than its individual states do now . Furthermore , Europe has a lot to contribute to the world in terms of its liberal traditions and political culture , providing both a partner and a necessary balance to the USA in global affairs . Once unified , Europe will become an -LRB- even more -RRB- important negotiating and trading partner one of the biggest economies in the world . It will have a population of 450 million more than the United States and Russia combined . It will be the worlds biggest trader and generate one quarter of global wealth . It presently gives more aid to poor countries than any other donor . Its currency , the euro , comes second only to the US dollar in international financial markets . France , Germany , Poland - these countries can hardly ever negotiate something with giants such as the US or China . Europe as one country stands a better chance of putting its message across effectively . 	A federal Europe will be a stronger international actor
Federalism and subsidiarity , that things should be dealt with at the lowest , most local , level possible , can allow for regional identities in a way national states can not . For example for Northern Ireland , Corsica , Basque Region , Lombardy . In a Federal Europe such peoples would not feel under threat from a dominant culture and long-running conflicts could be resolved , as issues of sovereignty become less relevant within the new political structures . 	Subsidiarity will deal with regional identities problem
A federal Europe would build upon the success of the EU and its predecessors in taming the nationalism that caused so much conflict in the twentieth century . The EU is drawing nearer to realising the vision of its founders for an ever-closer union . Despite the EUs relative success in this regard , while national governments still exist they will regard policy-making within Europe as a competitive business , abusing vetoes and damaging the potential prosperity of all of Europes citizens . Such is the case with Britain 's veto over the carbon tax , which the EU wants to implement - The British government is `` highly likely '' to block European Commission proposals for a carbon tax contained in a widely-circulated draft version of the Energy Taxation Directive , EU diplomatic sources said yesterday . A federal European state can build on the shared history and culture of its members to further the common good , while accommodating regional differences . 	A federal Europe will benefit the citizens of its member states
The success of federal states elsewhere in providing peace and prosperity for their citizens , alongside democratic safeguards , point to the advantages of pursuing this model in Europe . The USA , Australia and Canada provide standards of living for their citizens which most Europeans would envy , while federal India is the best example of a long-term democratic success in the developing world . The application of the principles of federalism to the European social and environmental policy s the key to European success . The creation of the single market meant that much national regulation of social and environmental issues ceased to be effective : only a European approach at the same level as the regulation of business would be able to work . Otherwise , companies might simply transfer from one member state with a great deal of regulation in these areas to another member state with less . If what economists call externalities were not to go unaddressed altogether , European social and environmental policies became necessary . Therefore only federal unity can bring EU states closer together in order for them to work as successfully as others federal countries . 	The federal model has proved to be a success previously
In a globalised economy , there is a need to tame multinational corporations , which would be otherwise capable of playing national governments off against each other in search for low wages , social costs and state protection . A federal Europe would be powerful enough to demand high standards of behaviour from such companies , because only a powerful and economically significant player can dictate restricting conditions . This would ensure fair wages , safe working conditions and - additionally - Europe would be able to force the multinational companies to implement correct and holistic policies and would also be in a position to make a greater difference on environmental issues such as global warming . Sovereignty becomes less relevant when effective independence is lost anyway as the economy and the problems faced by all nations are increasingly globalised . 	A federal Europe will ensure that large , multinational businesses remain accountable for their actions
Currently , the United States imports nearly two-thirds of its Petroleum , with the leading suppliers including nations such as Nigeria , Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . Due to political instability and the difficult US relations with these nations , US supplies can not be considered secure , and with the results of research into alternative sources of energy being decades away from fruition the United States needs alternative sources of oil today . One option is Canada , which is individually already the United States single largest energy supplier . Canadas known reserves total 179 billion barrels , placing it third behind Saudi Arabia , but some estimates have put its total at as high as 2 trillion barrels . The XL Pipeline project would help bring this oil overland into the United States . On the Canadian end , the increased market access would lead to rapid development , which in turn would increase Canadian capacity to the level to which it could reach a much greater portion of US demand . Furthermore , the United States enjoys close relations and an open border with Canada , meaning that this oil will likely arrive without the strings attached that come from buying from Venezuela or the Middle East . In the case of the latter the Pipeline would allow the US to disengage from the region to a degree . Even if hypothetically Canadian relations were to turn frosty , the existence of the pipeline would nevertheless ensure that the US would remain the only viable market . U.S. Energy Information Administration , U.S. Imports by Country of Origin , 	The pipeline will reduce American dependence on Middle Eastern and Latin American oil
Canadas Oil reserves will be of major strategic value in the next century . Currently the United States is Canadas preferred trading partner and strategic ally , both because of a history of past cooperation , and because the US is both more willing and able to support Canadian claims to the Arctic than China . The Pipeline would consolidate this relationship , ensuring that the development of Canadas reserves would occur with the American market in mind , because once built , it would be far more expensive to build a second Pipeline than to simply use the existing one . The United States , is not however , Canadas only option . Canada is determined to sell the oil one way or another , and an American refusal will not save the environment . What it will do is make Canada look elsewhere . The Canadian government publicly floated a joint-Canadian-Chinese pipeline proposal which would bring the oil to the Pacific after the Obama Administration delayed consideration of the project until after 2012 . Just as the Keystone Pipeline would lock Canada into the US Market , a decision to develop Canadian reserves with the Chinese market in mind would be difficult to reverse , and undermine the energy independence of the United States rather than secure it .

Rwanda has been trying to increase the size of remittances in order to increase its autonomy . The President Paul Kagame has said aid is never enough and we need to complement it with homegrown schemes to accelerate growth . He wants a higher level of direct ownership in the nations projects and wants it because western donors had suspended aid . A change to remittances would reduce this vulnerability ; it would be much more difficult for donors to suspend the tax breaks they provide for remittances to individual countries than it is to cut aid . Indeed remittances are noticeably stable with money still being sent home during recessions and can even be countercyclical as migrants will send more if they know things are bad back home . This then takes the issue out of the hands of the politicians and puts it into the hands of the people . 	Provides autonomy for developing countries
Changing from ODA to Remittances is good for freedom of choice in two ways . First tax breaks and other incentives will mean that migrants have more money . It will clearly be up to the migrant to decide if they want to or can afford to send their money home ; they can decide how much they want to send , when they want to end it , how they want to send it etc . . At the other end it will be up to the individual recipient to decide how they want to spend the money received . Secondly it is good for the freedom of choice of the taxpayer . At the moment they are having their choice taken away from them as they have their own money being spent by the government on someone else ; foreign countries . The individual taxpayer sees none of the benefit of this money and often they dont like paying so much aid , 59 % of Americans support cutting aid . 	Remittances creates freedom of choice for individuals
Human life is precious and whilst driving remains one of the most dangerous things people do on a day to day basis , we must do everything reasonable to prevent deaths . Raising the driving age will cut the number of accidents on the roads . In 2008 alone in the USA there were 6428 fatalities involving young drivers and passengers aged between 15 and 20 . Raising the driving age by a year or more will greatly reduce these accidents and deaths . 	Every study carried out in this field shows that younger drivers are more likely to be involved in serious accidents - raising the age would make the roads a safer place .
In most countries there are strict rules that govern who is and is not allowed to drive . Practically speaking , the infrastructure is already there to enforce an increase in the age limit one of the main aims of the Metropolitan Police in the UK is Seizing uninsured and unlicensed vehicles - the age limit for licensing has no effect on the Police 's ability to enforce the law . Governments already restrict driving to make it safer through laws concerning alcohol use , insurance and the age limits already in place . Making the age limit higher would simply add to this campaign to make the roads a safer place . 	Government has a responsibility to restrict driving to make it safer .
Despite the fact that using a mobile -LRB- cell -RRB- phone is illegal in many countries , there are still places including a lot of US states in which it is completely legal to use a phone even to send text messages indeed one in three -LRB- 34 % -RRB- texting teens ages 16-17 say they have texted while driving . This has been identified as a serious problem among teenage drivers who are themselves more familiar with the technology and do not see driving as an environment in which it is inappropriate to divert ones attention . Adding at least a year onto the legal driving age would bring maturity in all areas and an increased awareness of the dangers of driving whilst using mobile media and communication devices . 	Young people are generally more technologically capable , and are more likely to be distracted by mobile media devices than older people .
Few countries think 16 and 17 year olds are grown up enough to vote , drink alcohol or smoke . Yet most allow them to get behind the wheel of a car , even though it is a dangerous weapon in immature , careless or reckless hands . Society usually sees 18 as the age at which young people become adults . Should n't driving be one of the privileges ad responsibilities of adulthood ? 	Driving is considered to be an 'adult responsibility ' similar in nature to drinking or smoking cigarettes , and should therefore carry the same age restrictions .
The Hyperloop would be cheap to build . The pods themselves would only cost $ 1.35 million each , the pressurised tube just $ 650million -LRB- or double if wanting vehicles -RRB- , with only two stations their cost would only be $ 250million . The biggest cost would be the construction of the pylons carrying the tube which is estimated at $ 2.55 or $ 3.15 billion . There is an estimated total cost of $ 4.06 billion for the passenger only version or $ 5.31 billion for the vehicle version . This should be compared to the current cost for Californias high speed rail project which is estimated to be $ 68billion while covering much the same ground .

Public transportation has not been getting much faster over the last few decades . The fastest method of transport , supersonic jets in the form of Concorde ceased operation in October 2003 . Even if at some point a new generation of supersonic planes are built these will not be ideal for travelling between cities that are comparatively close together . The time spent getting the plane up and down from cruising altitude means they would take longer over these short distances than a slower option at ground level . The Hyperloop at more than 700mph will be twice as fast as high speed rail . To take the different options on the San Francisco-Los Angeles route cars take 5hours 30minutes , the proposed high speed train would take 2hours 38minutes , by plane takes 1hour 15minutes whereas the Hyperloop would only take 35minutes . End of an era for Concorde , , 24 October 2003 , Musk , Elon , Hyperloop Alpha , , 12 August 2013 , p. 8 , 56 	Fastest possible transportation over a short distance
The Hyperloop would be the cheapest mode of intercity transport possible . Transporting 7.4 million people each way and amortizing the cost of $ 6 billion over 20 years gives a ticket price of $ 20 for a one-way trip for the passenger version of Hyperloop . There are very few additional costs . Usually the main cost for transportation beyond the infrastructure is the energy but the Hyperloop produces more energy than it uses so would make a profit here . There would be additional maintenance costs and some minor staff costs but this is unlikely to add too much to the ticket price . The Hyperloop would therefore be very price competitive compared to the $ 100 and up for flights .

There are cases in which it is necessary to terminate a pregnancy , lest the mother and/or the child die . In such cases of medical emergency and in the interest of saving life , surely it is permissible to abort the fetus . Also , due to advances in medical technology it is possible to determine during pregnancy whether the child will be disabled . In cases of severe disability , in which the child would have a very short , very painful and tragic life , it is surely the right course of action to allow the parents to choose a termination . This avoids both the suffering of the parents and of the child . 	There can be medical reasons for terminating a pregnancy
Women should have control over their own bodies ; they have to carry the child during pregnancy and undergo childbirth . No one else carries the child for her ; it will be her responsibility alone , and thus she should have the sole right to decide . These are important events in a womans life , and if she does not want to go through the full nine months and subsequent birth , then she should have the right to choose not to do so . There are few if any other cases where something with such profound consequences is forced upon a human being against her/his will . To appeal to the childs right to life is just circular whether a fetus has rights or not , or can really be called a child , is exactly what is at issue . Everyone agrees that children have rights and shouldnt be killed ; a fetus is not a life yet . 	Women have a right to choose
Women , and in some cases girls , who have been raped should not have to suffer the additional torment of being pregnant with the product of that ordeal . To force a woman to produce a living , constant reminder of that act is unfair on both mother and child . In cases where the rape victim can not afford or is not ready to have a child , abortion can do both the victim and the unborn baby a favor . There are cases where school students are impregnated through rape . Pregnancy itself is a constant reminder of the sexual assault they underwent and might cause emotional instability , which will affect their studies , and subsequently their future . Babies born to unready mothers are likely to be neglected or would not be able to enjoy what other children have , be it due to financial reasons or the unwillingness of the mothers to bring up the `` unwanted children '' . 	Rape victims have no choice when it comes to getting pregnant , therefore they should have the right to terminate the pregnancy
Not only is banning abortion a problem in theory , offending against a woman 's right to choose , it is also a practical problem . Enforcing an abortion ban would require a quite degrading and inhumane treatment of those women who wished to have their fetus terminated . Moreover , if pregnant women traveled abroad , they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal . Either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement , or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it . The middle way of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life . The demand for abortions will always exist ; making abortion illegal , will simply drive it underground and into conditions where the health and safety of the woman might be put at risk . Example : Polish women , living in a country with extremely restrictive abortion laws often go abroad to the Netherlands , Germany and Austria for abortions . Women who are not lucky enough to live in environments such as the EU may be forced to go to foreign countries and undergo underground , unsafe abortions . 	There are practical problems with banning abortion
Claims that power within the IMF is distributed according to the reality of the members weight in the global financial system are inaccurate . The IMF reflects the financial system as it was 50 years ago and has done little to acknowledge the growth of countries like Brazil , Russia , India , and China -LRB- BRICs -RRB- , which have far fewer votes than their economic heft merits , while Western countries like Belgium are actually overrepresented . Significant reforms to the voting quotas need to be implemented in order to create an IMF that is true to the reality of the world financial system . 	Under representation of emerging economies
Since Western countries do not suffer from food shortages , they do not understand how vital food and access to healthcare is for survival in the developing world . The IMF treats food and healthcare in its policies just like any other commodity on the market , sometimes with disastrous humanitarian consequences .

The Palestinian people since 1967 have demonstrated through resistance to Israeli occupation their desire for an independent state of their own . Throughout the years polls have consistently showed respectable Palestinian majorities in favour of a negotiated two-state settlement , which would offer them an independent state as well as allowing Israel to continue to exist as an independent state alongside the new Palestinian nation . Israel 's refusal to withdraw to the 1967 borders means that the majority of Palestinian people are compelled to live under the control of a state they do not wish to be a part of , a violation of their right to self-determination under international law . The 1993 Vienna Declaration , which reaffirmed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter -LRB- and so sets the standard in current international law -RRB- , unequivocally gives all peoples the right to self-determination : All people have the right to self-determination . Owing to this right they freely establish their political status and freely provide their economic , social and cultural development ... World Conference on Human Rights considers refusal of the right to self-determination as a violation of human rights and emphasizes the necessity of effective realization of this right . Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in 2006 that the pre-1967 borders uphold the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people for a secure , united , democratic and economically viable state coexisting peacefully with Israel . By this measure , the Palestinian majority in the occupied territories have the right to self-determination -LRB- by democratic processes -RRB- , and Israel 's suppression of that right through its refusal to withdraw to the 1967 borders should be seen as a human rights violation . Consequently , Israel should withdraw to its 1967 borders in order to end its violation of the rights of the Palestinian people . BBC News . Israeli settlements condemned by Western powers .

Because Israel won the land during war , it is considered occupied territory under international law , and it is illegal for Israel to annex it . In July 2004 , the International Court of Justice delivered an Advisory Opinion observing that under customary international law as reflected in Article 42 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague IV Convention , territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army , and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised . Israel raised a number of exceptions and objections , but the Court found them unpersuasive . The Court ruled that territories had been occupied by the Israeli armed forces in 1967 , during the conflict between Israel and Jordan , and that subsequent events in those territories , had done nothing to alter the situation . Even the Israeli Supreme court has ruled that Judea and Samaria -LSB- a.k.a . . The West Bank -RSB- areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation . Therefore , Israel has no better claim to these lands than that it won them in a war , which is an illegitimate claim under international law , and also illegitimate as a thinly-disguised , morally abhorrent might makes right argument . The fact that Arab states initiated the 1967 war does not justify Israel responding by annexing Palestinian territory . A just settlement would have been a return to the previous borders in exchange for security guarantees , etc . . Instead , Israel unjustly used the opportunity to take land from an innocent people . One bad act does not justify another bad act in return . Moreover , it is notable that the nations which Israel took Gaza and the West Bank from in 1967 -LRB- Egypt and Jordan , respectively -RRB- were not representative nations of the areas ' majority inhabitants , the Palestinian people . It is thus illegitimate for Israel to claim ownership of Palestinian land because it defeated non-Palestinian nations in a war , and Israel should therefore return to its pre-1967 borders , leaving Gaza and the West Bank to the Palestinian people .

If Israel were to withdraw to its 1967 borders , the Palestinian Liberation Organisation -LRB- PLO -RRB- would recognise Israel as legitimate within its remaining territories and end the conflict . In October 2010 Senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Yasser Abed Rabbo said that the Palestinians will be willing to recognize the State of Israel in any way that it desires , if the Americans would only present a map of the future Palestinian state that includes all of the territories captured in 1967 , including East Jerusalem . We want to receive a map of the State of Israel which Israel wants us to accept . If the map will be based on the 1967 borders and will not include our land , our houses and East Jerusalem , we will be willing to recognize Israel according to the formulation of the government within the hour ... Any formulation -LSB- presented to us -RSB- even asking us to call Israel the ` Chinese State ' we will agree to it , as long as we receive the 1967 borders added Rabbo . Even Ismail Haniyeh , leader of the more extreme Hamas organisation , has said Hamas will accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and will offer Israel a long term truce if it withdraws accordingly . Significant international support for Israel withdrawing to the 1967 borders also exists , even from states with a history of hostility with Israel such as Iran and Saudi Arabia , who have made such a withdrawal a precondition of peace and recognition talks with Israel . Even then-Israeli Prime Miniser Ehud Olmert acknowledged in 2008 that almost all of the territory seized during the Six-Day War in 1967 will have to be given back to the Palestinians return for peace . Therefore Israel should withdraw to its 1967 borders as this would bring peace and security to Israel by ending the conflict with the Palestinians and neighbouring states . Haaretz .

One of the main impetuses for young men to join fraternities comes from the idea that it will be easy to have sex with women should they do . This idea has two affects on fraternities . The first , detailed in this point is more indirect . The people who apply to fraternities do so because of these preconceptions and often are able to get in to fraternities . This means that a fraternity essentially becomes a place where a large number of men who already tend towards chauvinistic ideas gather . It seems logical then that often fraternities colour people towards the objectification of women . This is further exacerbated by initiation rituals which often emphasise sexist attitudes , for example , raiding sororities and stealing lingerie . The significant social pressure this creates , especially on newer university students who might fear exclusion , means that even those who did not have bad preconceptions of women before can end up tending strongly toward chauvinism . Further , fraternities often have strong relationships with sororities . This is specifically important because often sorority girls are often encouraged by the hierarchy of the sorority to maintain good relations with related fraternities . This means that many younger girls might be encouraged to play into the stereotypes that the fraternity boys expect of them to maintain the sororitys popularity with the fraternity . As such , negative stereotypes are reinforced by this relationship . Banning fraternities would be conducive to changes these conceptions by preventing people with chauvinistic opinions gathering to begin with and reinforcing each others views of the world . Further , with less social pressure to impress the frat boys , related sororities might play into these stereotypes less . 	Banning Fraternities Will Prevent Chauvinistic Behaviour
Whilst the initial proposition argument claims that fraternities lead to the objectification of women and how this harms women indirectly , this argument claims that the men included in fraternities are more likely to physically harm and rape women . The culture of the objectification of women and the expectation that members of a fraternity should have sex leads to incidents where fraternity members will report to other members of the fraternity about women that they got with the night before . Whilst this is typical of most male groups , it becomes more insidious when those who are able to do better with the women often end up doing better within the formal hierarchy of the fraternity . As such , because of these pressures there is often an impetus from members of a fraternity to have sex with women regardless of the consequences . Given the first argument about the general perception of women that fraternities promote and it is logical that there might be a higher chance that fraternity members would be involved in crimes such as rape and sexual assault . Further , the drinking culture that often goes with fraternities exacerbates these problems as young men who ordinarily would not succumb to the social pressures do , or perceive a responses from women incorrectly , leading to cases of sexual assault . 	Fraternities Lead to the Direct Sexual Exploitation of Women
There seems to be little doubt in any ones mind that Putin and his regime were the focus of the protest . It is , equally , no secret that Putin has a fairly brutal attitude towards political dissent ; he has expelled even allies in parliament for criticism , uses force to crush unsanctioned protests , and locks up potential opponents . Locking up Pussy Riot in order to stop their opposition therefore fits in with Putins previous actions against his opposition and seems likely to be the desired result . In the light of that , it seems an extraordinary coincidence that what he would have wanted is exactly what happened . Putin himself said after they were sentenced `` We have red lines beyond which starts the destruction of the moral foundations of our society If people cross this line they should be made responsible in line with the law . '' Putins record is not one that suggests that he is happy to step back and allow events to take their course in the hope that what he wants to happen just chances to come along quite the reverse . Suggesting that this is a happy coincidence for Putin would be a little like suggesting that the decision to have term limits for the presidency , just not for Putin , was just the happy outcome of an impartial process . If this was just the Church and the courts happening to favour the interests of an over-mighty president , then Putin must be the luckiest man alive . 	The blasphemy charge looks suspiciously convenient for Putin
Pussy Riots protest was politically focussed , the response seems politically driven and now they are prisoners . The name and chorus of the song performed was Virgin Mary , Chase Putin Out . It is very hard to see what would be a better definition of the phrase political prisoner . Where any punishment required for this act and Proposition contends that there was not then it was at most a mild public order offence . Amnesty International and the overwhelming majority of the International media have reached that conclusion . The very fact that this has become a shows the extent to which those who able to step back from the situation recognise this for what it is ; a clear abuse of presidential power given the thinnest sheen of respectability by a compliant church . Such religious content as was contained in the protest fairly obviously relates to the setting and is not the main content of the song . Its a fairly straightforward artistic device . It does , however , raise the question that if the intent of this song was to be blasphemous a necessary component of proving it to be so then why did they do such a bad job of it and spend so much their time going on about politics ; it would suggest somewhat incompetent activists . 	The focus of their song was one of political dissent rather than religion
The Russian Orthodox Church has long been happy to prop up whichever strongman happens to be running the Kremlin , this was particularly the case in the time of the Tsars but was even the case under the Communists for all their supposed Atheism . It certainly would not come as any surprise to Kremlin-watchers that , as Putins government shreds the last vestiges of democratic credibility in favour of the strong-arm tactics of earlier Russian leaders Tsarist and Communist that the Church would be only too happy to help out with such difficulties as this as the Church and Putin are particularly close . The fact is that the long arm of the presidential office now reaches into all parts of Russian public life , including religious life , for example the FSB has harassed other Christian sects and proselytizing has been banned . The intrusion of the state has been demonstrated far more effectively by the response to the protest than could ever have been achieved through such an event on its own . Although that reality may be powerfully ironic , it does little to help these political prisoners held at presidential whim and nothing more than hollow and self-serving justification from the courts . 	History of the Orthodox Church and the Russian state
Representative democracy is less legitimate because it empowers unelected elites . Representative democracy is systematically biased against ordinary people , particularly poor people . Unelected elites like wealthy businessmen , trade union leaders , civil servants , party officials and media proprietors are able to bypass the democratic process and exert direct pressure on elected politicians . This happens because decisions are made behind closed doors by individual politicians who can be easily bullied or bought out . This allows elites to effectively wield public power even when they are not elected themselves . If decisions were made more directly by the people there would be less scope for elites to manipulate the process by simply appealing to a politicians self-interest . Elite influence is a systematic problem because it is self-reinforcing : elites lobby for laws to preserve their own power and disempower the public . A good example of this is Rupert Murdochs behind-the-scenes lobbying for the repeal of regulations preventing him from dominating the media market . Considering that at any past time in the human history the conditions of equality in labour division , education and technological tools were not as favourable as nowadays in terms of allowing citizen political involvement , a more participatory political decision-making must be now taken into account . A clear example is the Iceland 's `` wiki constitution '' -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . Then , although the classic criticism against direct democracy formulas based on the premise that size creates problrms referring to the difficulties to shape participatory citizen deliberation in our enormous current nation-states may still be true , cultural , social and technological conditions for participation have become much more favourable .

Representative Democracy Enables Rule by Elites
Giving people more responsibility for making political decisions is itself a good thing . Participating in political decision-making allows citizens to achieve a higher state of intellectual and moral maturity , letting them lead better and wiser lives . Since the difficult business of government forces them to learn how to make tough choices and compromise they will quickly abandon their simplistic prejudices and assumptions . Representative democracy is the opposite : it treats the public as if they are incapable of making important choices themselves , and thus denies most citizens a chance to meaningfully participate . Representative democracy often implies a mercantile vision of the political performance , where the politicians play the role of the sellers and the voters act as a simple buyers of political options . This means that the vast majority of voters remain ignorant at best , and apathetic at worst . This leaves them vulnerable to manipulation by deceitful politicians and political commentators . Furthermore , since many government decisions involve major moral dilemmas , citizens who participate in such decision-making will develop a more nuanced moral understanding and more thoughtful personal conduct . Thus , all democratic participation is beneficial . Participatory forms of democracy allows people to participate more than they otherwise would . Evidence for the impact of democratic participation is that radical and intolerant views are frequently expressed in young democracies but fade away as participation in democratic politics implants in the people respect for due process and different points of view . A good example of this is that intolerant far-right parties are much more successful in the young democracies of Eastern Europe than the old democracies of Western Europe .

Representative democracy is oppressive because it takes more power away from the people than is strictly necessary . Whilst a completely direct democracy is impractical , we should nevertheless recognise that there is no reason not to have as much direct democracy as possible . In the words of Herbert Marcuse , Free election of masters does not abolish the masters or the slaves . The key point is that merely holding an election every four years does not fundamentally alter our state of subservience : at election time , we are given a choice of three or four manifesto programmes on an all-or-nothing basis , manifestos which may never be honoured . The only power over our government we as citizens have is the power to punish politicians retrospectively , by voting them out after years of obeying them . It is quite possible to create an authoritarian system that has regular representative elections , even with several competitive candidates and yet still not be giving power to the people , as is shown by Iran . This is wrong . The presumption should always be that the people keep as much power over their own lives and hand as little to their masters as possible because they never get to consent to the powers that rule them . Given that we are born under governments which exist whether we like it or not , it as an offense to our natural liberty and equality that those governments should hold any more power over us than is absolutely necessary . Besides , when the interests of the state are not the interests of the people , we have the government of the few over the rest . Marcuse , H. -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . .

Participatory democracy will lead to better decisions because laws will only be passed if they can be justified to the people . Professional politicians are disproportionately drawn from the privileged classes and are often ignorant of the effects their policies will have on ordinary people as are the civil servants who advise them . Moreover , professional politicians are susceptible to corruption , lobbying or bullying by powerful vested interests seeking to direct government policy away from the general interest represented by the vast majority of the individual citizens , who generally lack such a determinant influence over the decision-making . Participatory democracy will therefore make sure that the legislation that is passed will help the people as much as possible ; for example they will limit unecessary bureaucracy and make sure that policies are fair . Thus for example Switzerland has passed with 68 % of the vote in a referendum a proposal that prevents big payouts for managers known as golden handshakes and golden parachutes and shareholders will have a veto over saleries . Willsher , K. , and Inman , P. -LRB- 3 March 2013 -RRB- Voters in Swiss referendum backs curbs on executives pay and bonuses The Guardian . 	Participatory Democracy Produces Better Decisions
Representative systems struggle to sustain popular trust , which is bad for democracy . Public trust in politics always tends to be dented by three specific features of representative systems . Firstly , the perception of elite influence over the political process is a largely unavoidable feature of electoral democracy because such elites are easily placed to manipulate politics , even if they do not actually do so . Secondly , the spotlight in representative democracy is on individual politicians -LRB- rather than on policies -RRB- and consequently exposing scandals and smearing the characters of politicians is an essential part of the political game : media coverage of politicians is largely hostile -LRB- particularly problematic if it diverts discussion from the merits and demerits of particular policies -RRB- . A third feature of the system is that , since public opinion has no direct power , unpopular decisions dont have to be properly justified . Governments often defy public opinion when they think a policy will pay off in the long run , and often they dont really bother explaining why they are doing so -LRB- a good example of this is Gordon Browns signing of the Lisbon treaty in 2007 -RRB- . These three factors all tend to undermine trust in politics in representative systems . Trust is essential for democracy because without it people will not bother following politics or voting , leaving the door open for elites and aggressive minorities to wield undue influence . A clear example of this phenomenon is in the United States , where Christian fundamentalists despite being a minority wield enormous power . The reason for this is that turnout in American elections is very low , whilst fundamentalist Christians are politically very active and organised , allowing them huge influence . 	Participatory forms of Democracy Can Restore Trust in Politics
The sheer volume of advertising in our society is incredible . You can not watch television , ride on a bus or even walk down the street without someone trying to sell you something or inform you of something . Recent research suggests people living in a city today sees up to 5,000 advertisements a day . 50 % of those surveyed said they thought ` advertising today was out of control ' . People should n't have to go about their lives having their minds saturated with such a vast quantity of , in most cases , redudant and profiteering information . They should be able to go about their daily lives in peace without being forced to watch , listen or view an advertisement . 	There are too many advertisements in everyday life .
Advertising leads to many people being overwhelmed by the endless need to decide between competing demands on their attention this is known as the tyranny of choice or choice overload . Recent research suggests that people are on average less happy than they were 30 years ago - despite being better off and having much more choice of things to spend their money on . The claims of adverts crowd in on people , raising expectations about a product and leading to inevitable disappointment after it is bought . A recent advertisement for make-up was banned in Britain due to the company presenting its product as being more effective than it actually was . Shoppers feel that a poor purchase is their fault for not choosing more wisely , and regret not choosing something else instead . Some people are so overwhelmed that they can not choose at all . Schwartz , The Tyranny of Choice , 2004 . 	People are given too much choice , which makes them less happy .
Many adverts do more than just advertising products . Some try to make people feel inferior if they do n't have the product , or if they have something which the product would change . Perceptions of beauty and fashion in particular have been terribly distorted . Many young people have low self-esteem , and lead unhealthy lifestyles because they feel they should be thinner and more attractive like the models they see in adverts . This leads to serious problems like eating-disorders and self-harm . Research that proved this effect also concluded that ` the media can boost self-esteem -LRB- happiness with one 's self -RRB- where it is providing examples of a variety of body shapes . However , it often tends to portray a limited -LRB- small -RRB- number of body shapes ' . 	Advertisements try to make people feel bad about not having the product .
People can not just choose to ignore advertising , because advertisers use many underhand methods to get their message across . Posters have attention grabbing words , or provocative pictures . Some adverts today are even being hidden in what seem like pieces or art or public information so people do n't realise they are being marketed to . The introduction of digital screens allows businesses to alter their advertising to respond to specific events , making advertisements not only everywhere , but seemingly all-knowing . By targeting people 's unconscious thoughts adverts are a form of brainwashing that take away people 's freedoms to make choices . 	Advertisements are an attempt to brainwash customers .
Advertising gives the impression , especially to children , that they can and should have everything they want . This makes people too interested in material things . People are becoming more selfish and obsessed with their possessions , and losing their values of patience , hard work , moderation and the importance of non-material things like family and friends . This harms their relationships and their personal development , which has serious effects for society as a whole . 	Advertisements tell children that they should have everything they want .
Boxers are presented as beacons of success for young people , but they are not good role models . Children should not idolize people who make a living by injuring other people . In addition to the violence in the ring , brawls often break out at press conferences and even inside boxing venues . The marketing of boxing exalts this mindless violence and those who perpetrate it . Mike Tyson is a particularly harmful example . Tyson was one of the most popular and successful boxers in history , when he faced Evander Holyfield in the most hyped fight of the year . Tyson cruelly bit off a portion of Holyfields ear in the fight , on live television . These are not role models of which we should be proud . , Tyson : Id bite again , October 4 , 1999 , . 	The celebrity status that societies award to boxers glamorizes and legitimizes violence in society .
Unlike in any other sport , boxers intend to physically injure their opponents by knockout . Allowing people to intentionally inflict injuries upon others for public entertainment and private profit is barbaric . Children especially are trained in these ways . When boxers turn professional , they have often already fought in at least 50 fights in their youth , which does not include the countless rounds of sparring during training sessions . Boxers are essentially being trained in violent ways , often at a young age . The Australian Medical Association actively opposes boxing for this reason , calling it , a public demonstration of interpersonal violence which is unique among sporting activities . While there are other rough sports , boxing is different because its is harmful . The World Medical Association , which also opposes the sport , justifies this position by noting , its basic intent is to produce bodily harm in the opponent . Boxing is a violent sport , in which youth are taught to try to hurt their peers . It has no place in modern society . , Boxing , 1997 , reaffirmed 2007 , accessed July 8 , 2011 , . 	Boxing is a barbaric sport , and it should not be a part of any 21st century society .
When most people think of boxingthe sport that they see on TVthey are thinking particularly of professional boxing , which is much worse . The main difference is that in amateur boxing the round lengths are often shorter as are the number of rounds and more protective equipment is worn . Therefore the level of exposure is minimised . As a result , 76 participants out of every million die , in professional boxing , but only six per million die in amateur boxing . That makes professional boxing more than 12 times more dangerous than amateur boxing . The fact remains , however , that professional boxing is violent , barbaric , and dangerous , so it should be banned . Svinth , Death under the Spotlight . 	All professional boxing should be banned , not amateur boxing .
To be successful , boxers have to train for 8 hours a day 6 days a week , spending the best years of their lives in the gym . Because most boxers lack a formal education and spend all their time in the gym they employ managers to handle their business affairs ; very often the boxers entourage control the fighters destiny . This relationship can be exploitative given the inequality of bargaining power and the fact that most boxers need to make as much money as they can before they are worn out . An average boxer will have about 30-40 top-level professional bouts in them before their health and skills will dramatically deteriorate . Whilst it may well be in the fighters interest to hang-up his gloves , those around him have a financial incentive to push fighters into more and more title defences or comebacks . The decisions that older boxers make provide further proof that they feel they have been exploited : over 80 % of older boxers surveyed in Chicago said that they did not want their children to be boxers . The truth is that boxers are only treated as money-making devices by their promoters and the boxing industry . When American boxer Leavander Johnson died after a fight in 2005 , his promoter told the press , I dont think theres anyone to blame here other than the circumstances . Hes a victim of his own courage . This shows promoters desire to exploit boxers courage and willingness to put themselves at risk , without having any regret for such a dangerous system . Oftentimes the promoters actively make it more dangerous , exploiting their clients for criminal ends . In his exploration of boxing deaths throughout history , Joseph Svinth finds that in addition to health reasons , many deaths were criminal , with the promoter playing the dual role of gangster . Its time to break up this industry before any more young athletes get taken advantage of in a bad way . Loc Wacquant , The pugilistic point of view : How boxers think and feel about their trade , , Vol . 24 , No . 4 -LRB- August 1995 -RRB- , 489-535 , , 523 . 	Boxing is famously exploitative , but a ban could prevent youth from falling into the sports economic trap .
The British Medical Association has repeatedly called for a ban on boxing or a removal of the head from the permitted target areas . The body of medical evidence is growing that suggests even if a boxer survives individual bouts relatively unmarked , the cumulative effect of a career in boxing can lead to a greater susceptibility to chronic neurological injury . A doctor who has studied the effect of boxing on Parkinsons specifically says that boxing causes unnecessary harm . He writes , Unlike most degenerative neurologic diseases , this disorder can be prevented . Although the incidence of injury is much higher in sports such as basketball , rugby or riding , the risk of serious injury in boxing is far greater . That risk is so great that boxing should be banned . A ban , quite simply , would mean fewer people dead , injured or permanently brain damaged . Friedman , Progressive Parkinsonism , 545 . 	Boxing causes many deaths , and medical officials have continually called for it to be banned .
Shopping for local produce is also part of a wider movement to rediscover and celebrate local food cultures . The Slow Food movement emphasises the cultural importance of local cuisines based upon the range of foods that are available within a particular region . By treating the whole world as our larder we have gained an enormous choice of foods , but at the cost of our own culinary heritage and folk traditions . This can cause problems as for example with local varieties of rice in Africa being lost due to competition from cheaper rice producers like Thailand . Each individual cuisine deserves to be preserved and encouraged . We have also lost a sense of seasonality , expecting asparagus and strawberries all year round . Local food restores this connection with the rhythm of the seasons , and connects us to the land around us and to our ancestors who helped to shape it . 	Local cuisine deserves to be celebrated
Earmarks usually represent expensive programs of little worth to the American people . As the main means of pork barrel politics , earmarks are typically vanity projects with little economic benefit . Examples include the Alaskan Bridge to Nowhere -LRB- a $ 400 million project to connect an island community of just 50 people to the mainland -RRB- , $ 1 million for shuttle buses at Western Kentucky University , and a grant of $ 300 000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society of Hawaii . Worse , a recent Harvard Business School study found that states which received the most federal spending via earmarks from well-connected Congressmen actually suffered economically as a result , because the federal money crowded out private investment and distorted the local jobs market . 	Earmarks do not represent an efficient use of taxpayers ' money
The use of earmarks erodes trust in politicians and the federal government for two reasons . First , it reinforces a belief that politicians ignore the wider national interest but are simply out for themselves , scrabbling to channel as much federal pork as possible back home in order to aggrandise themselves and ensure re-election . Second , it assumes that the answer to every local problem or issue is for the federal government to raise yet more tax revenue and bestow it from on high because Washington-knows-best . It is a symbol that makes it hard to resist spending both for politicians and their constituents . 	Earmarks erode trust in the government
Earmarks are fundamentally unfair , benefiting some states and congressional districts much more than others regardless of the merits of their case for federal spending . Where spending priorities are decided by the executive they can set objective criteria and organise competitive bidding processes for specific projects . Earmarks avoid this merit-based approach and instead channel money to specific projects according to how well-connected their Congressional representatives are . Congressmen on the key spending committees , especially the Appropriations Committees , are best placed to channel pork back to their districts . It has been found that earmark spending rises between 40-50 % in a state if one of its Senators becomes Chair of a top-three committee . 	Earmarks do not accord with democratic principles of equity , fairness and justice
The ability to support or withhold approval from earmarks strengthens the party leaderships in Congress too much . Effectively the leadership can bribe elected representatives with pork for their state or district in order to get them to vote for flawed legislation or budgets . This was clearly seen in the 2010 Healthcare bill where in the Senate votes were secured from conservative Democrats by offering federal spending or subsidies that only affected the states of Louisiana and Nebraska . One consequence of the temptation provided by earmarks is poor policy-making , but more broadly it discourages Congressmen from thinking and voting independently , according to their consciences and their belief in what is best for the nation . 	Earmarks transfer too much power to political parties ' central leadership
Scrapping earmarks will save billions of dollars and contribute to reducing the appalling US budget deficit . Earmarks totalled about $ 16 billion of the 2009-10 budget , unnecessary spending which should be cut in the interests of both present and future US taxpayers . Earmarks can be a large amount of a departments budget , in 2005 the Office of Naval Research derived a quarter of its budget through earmarks . Granted , removing earmarks alone will not be sufficient to eliminate the budget deficit and get rid of wasteful government spending , but earmarks are the obvious place to start . Until these most egregious examples of waste are tackled , it will not be possible to move on to cut bigger spending programs . 	Abolishing earmarks will save money
Insurance is a key component in making the streets safe for all drivers on the road . Allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses allows them to gain drivers insurance . Driving absent insurance means that there is an incentive to drive off if you cause an accident to avoid having to pay for the damages you have caused and being criminally punished for driving without insurance . This leaves the other driver having to foot their own bill for the repairs to their vehicles . Moreover , even if the uninsured driver stays at the scene , illegal immigrants are characteristically very poor as they must engage in exploitative work to make a wage because they must hide from the state and do not get the same protections from the state , so would still be unable to pay for the damages they have caused . Moreover , having uninsured drivers on the road increases insurance premiums for all insured drivers on the road , as they have to de-facto pay for the risk and damage these uninsured drivers cause . Therefore , offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses allows for more fair and accountable systems of insurance and driving conditions on the road . 	This allows illegal immigrants to get drivers insurance , which makes safer and fairer roads .
Offering drivers licenses to illegal immigrants makes the streets safer by giving drivers training to people who would otherwise be driving on the streets without adequate education . Unlicensed drivers are five times more likely to get into a fatal crash than licensed drivers . A fact that needs to be acknowledged is that illegal immigrants have a necessity to drive and the vast majority will do so regardless of if they are given licenses or not . This is very dangerous both for them and for those who they share the road with as they are operating motor vehicles with a proper education on the rules of the road or any form of driving instruction or test to ensure that they can competently and safely drive on the streets . Illegal immigrants are very likely to opt into this system of drivers education and licensing because it is in their own interest to avoid breaking the law to avoid detection , but also because it is very much in their interest to get instruction on how to drive as they are as much a danger to themselves as they are to the rest of society when they drive without instruction . Therefore , offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses will help make the streets safer by giving drivers access to the education and instruction they need to be safe and competent drivers . 	The provision of drivers licenses makes the streets safer .
Drivers licenses are used a major form of identification in America and so granting illegal immigrants these forms of identification can help enfranchise one of the most exploited minorities in America . Despite American feelings on illegal immigrants , they are there in their society , contribute to their communities and are a group of people that are routinely and unjustly exploited because of their lack of access to state protection . Despite popular opinion of this being a punishment for breaking their laws , these people operate like any other citizen in American society and are human beings who deserve to be treated as such and to be offered at least some level of protection for the fact that they are human and for what they contribute to America communities and society . Providing these people with a proper form of identification , especially a drivers license , which is almost universally accepted as an adequate form of identification to access services from the state and to interact with the rest of society . Specifically , this allows immigrant communities to not feel as though they are confined to an isolated area as they now can travel further distances to gain better employment without fear of being caught and thrown into jail . Moreover , this allows them access to all services offered by the state that require identification such as voter registration . Therefore , this helps enfranchise a group that is normally exploited in America society . 	This is a gateway privilege that allows these people to integrate into American society .
Catalonia is likely to go its own way and decide it should make its own decisions regardless of the rest of Spains views . Artur Mas Catalonias President says `` If we can go ahead with a referendum because the government authorises it , it 's better . If not , we should do it anyway '' . So regardless of the Spanish position in his next four year term he will hold a referendum asking Do you want Catalonia to become a new state within the European Union ? If Spain then does not back down about allowing this then there may well be a constitutional crisis . So far the Catalan option is simply to internationalise the conflict we will have to go to Brussels to explain that they do n't even let us consult with the people . Ultimately despite being within Spain so long as support for independence remains strong the Catalans probably have more cards to play ; they provide more in taxes than they receive so could cut Madrid off , or in the final play they could unilaterally secede leaving Spain with the unpalatable option of either negotiating to get Catalonia back in , accepting , or invading .

The worst case scenario is one in which the Spanish government continues to deny the Catalan people the ability to decide for themselves democratically and peacefully then it is possible that eventually the result will be a change from a peaceful movement to a violent one . Some outside observers see parallels with the break up of Yugoslavia where the solution has to be further decentralisation and the center accepting a democratic route in Yugoslavia failure to do so ultimately lead to several wars . For the moment there are only the slightest of hints that things may get more radical if denied Pujol the General secretary of the governing Catalan party says `` There will be no way to avoid it . If we do n't deliver it someone else will . More radical parties . But in a negotiation it 's not the best thing to reveal what you are going to do next '' so there is the possibility some factions of the independence movement turning to violence as Eta did in the Basque region if denied the democratic route .

Every peoples has the right to self determination . This is enshrined in the UN Charter right at the start in Article 1 as a purpose of the United Nations To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and is also in other major international agreements . Large numbers of states have been recognised since this principle of self determination was recognised by the world in 1945 a great many of them states that are less natural states in terms of size , economy , ethnicity or geography so it would be wrong to deny a right exercised by so many others from the Catalans . It is clear that the Catalans wish to exercise this right to decide their own destiny democratically through a referendum . When polled by the Catalan Survey Institute 74.1 % said they would be in favour of organising a referendum with 19.9 % against , the remaining 6 % were undecided . The United Nations , Charter of the United Nations , 26 June 1945 , Chapter 1 , Article 1 , Coll , Gaspar Pericay , 74 % of Catalan citizens are in favour of holding an independence referendum in Catalonia , , 10 October 2012 , 	Catalans clearly want self determination
For Spain by far the biggest reason for allowing a referendum is that it may well be the best way of keeping Catalonia within Spain over the long term . So long as Spain says it will not allow a referendum or give the Catalans control over their own destiny the movement for Catalan independence is likely to get stronger as it can focus on the denial of democratic rights Spain is waving a red flag to the bull . Allow a referendum , particularly if it has to be accompanied by a long period of campaigning for reflection and Catalans will have to agonise whether it is in their own best interests , decide whether they want to damage their economy by having large companies such as Planeta the worlds largest Spanish language publishing business pulling out , sever extensive links with Spain , and risk their membership of the European Union which Spain would veto . If Spain were to offer as an alternative a new constitutional settlement that solves many of the grievances the Catalans have at the moment they might find they really want to remain within Spain , much as many scots would prefer devo-max .

The benefits of these events , unlike hosting an event such as an Olympic Games -LRB- which would be outside the reach of Gabon or Equatorial Guinea , especially with the increasing trend of the IOC to select major world cities in medium or high income countries -RRB- , is that more than one site in a country can host different parts of the tournament . This provides a platform for a focus on broad based development across the entire nation , rather than one-sideded development focused on one city .

The first film created in Nollywood - Living in Bondage - raised fundamental issues concerning marriage , wealth and spirituality . The film indicates the need to be aware of cults and what they can drive individuals to do . Furthermore films such Street Girls and Mamas Girls provide insight into the lives of prostitutes and the sex industry . Street Girls is enabling awareness of why girls are forced into prostitution and why they may be forced to commit criminal offences . Poverty is identified as a key driving factor . The range of topics covered - from immigration , women , witchcraft , corruption , terrorism , and infrastructure deficits - counteract historic silences in the public sphere . The films are raising awareness to viewers by presenting the stories in a new light - understandable , humorous , and relatable ; and will encourage citizens to demand change . Nollywood is showing the limits of believing in a single perspective , the Western perspective , to stories on Africa . 	A new perspective , raising topical issues
Norway and Denmark have already developed policies to restrict sexist advertising . In 2008 , the UN Committee to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women calls upon states to taken action and in particular the United Kingdom government to address this issue . In May of 2011 Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 's Committee on Equal Opportunity for Women made a case for sexist advertising as a barrier to gender equality . In that report standards were presented and methods to cope with sexist advertising were suggested . In Australia a government advisory board has developed a list of principles to guide both advertising and the fashion industry . 	Policies should be established which ban the promotion of sexist attitudes in advertising .
Sexist advertising harms women through objectification and diminishing of self-image . The United Nations Convention to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women -LRB- CEDAW -RRB- links stereotypes about women to prejudice based on gender . Through visual and verbal messages women are portrayed as subservient to men . Women are seen increasingly as sex objects and these ads legitimize violence against women . Sexist advertising also harms women 's self-image by portraying an ideal stylized body . The implied message is that consumers should seek to acquire these images even if they are contrary to the reality of body types and features . Eating disorders and obsessive beauty products consumption results in order to attain ideal beauty images presented in the media . Sexist ads also harm men through stereotyped images of masculinity . '' 	Sexist advertising is harmful to society , especially women .
Women 's rights to be free from stereotyping , prejudice , discrimination and objectification should be a matter of deep concern as they infringe on human rights related to gender . Advertising messages influence younger generations as well as send stereotypical images of men . As a result the objectification and violence against women will continue . Gender inequality and sexual harassment in the work place is not likely to diminish . This means that women will continue to suffer from discrimination based upon their gender . 	Women have a right to be free of stereotyping .
Adverts occupy more public space than ever before in history . Due to technology , public space is global and ads can been seen around the world , in 2009 the UK became the first major economy where advertisers spend more on internet advertising than on television advertising . Through such dominance , ads contribute to attitudes and values . Due to their power to influence attitudes within a society , serious attention should be paid to the content of advertising . 	Since advertising is pervasive in mediated messages , it has the power to influence social attitudes .
Apple has gone to greater lengths to make using their computers easy to use than PC makers have . Mac apps all have similar looks and interfaces . Juul Coolen explains that consistent interface design made it possible for users to actually use most Mac-applications in a very same way , creating a seamless and comfortable experience in the end . Users are able to anticipate how the system behaves and what to expect from its applications . This has been corroborated by people who have tried both PCs and Macs . Popular Mechanics conducted a usability survey that incorporated a panel of testers with a range of experience and preference that ran the gamut from expert users to -LSB- one person who -RSB- had never actually turned on a computer and concluded that overall the Mac was easier to use .

The Forrester Research , a survey of 4,500 consumers , rated Apple an 80 % , which is interpreted as good . However , Gateway scored a 66 ; Hewlett-Packard , a 64 ; and Compaq -LRB- a brand owned by H.P . -RRB- , a 63 scores that Forrester considers poor rankings in the customer experience index . Dell got 58 percent , a very poor rating . Bruce Tempkin , the vice president of Forrester , commented that the PC industry had indeed scored very poorly , and that this ought to serve as a wake-up call to Microsoft . This study corroborates a previous survey conducted by Consumer Reports , which asked for feedback from 4,500 laptop computer users and almost 5,600 desktop computer users after they had called in for tech support .

Tests of speed on Macs vs. PCs all conclude the same thing : Macs are faster . PC world tested this in 2007 and concluded : The fastest Windows Vista notebook weve tested this yearor for that matter , everis a Mac . Popular Mechanics verified this , basing its test both on a panel of users judging the computers on subjective points , as well as a series of benchmarking applications on both platforms . In both the and desktop showdowns , Apples computers were the winners , '' the magazine said . Mac hardware is faster than PC hardware , and Mac applications run faster as well . 	Macs are faster than PCs
Macs run into fewer problems when operating than PCs , because Macs are harder to target and most viruses target PCs . Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer at F-Secure , explains : Mac is more secure , simply because it has less attacks targeting it -LSB- hackers -RSB- existing codebase and expertise is on Windows , so they keep creating more Windows attacks . Paul Vixie , founder of the Internet Systems Consortium , agrees , saying that Macs are more secure because the code base is small and more modern , and because there are fewer Mac users , so there is less in it for the bad guys who make the viruses . Although it is true that both can get viruses , evidence shows that PCs get them far more often . Moreover , even if PCs arent getting viruses , its likely because they have to constantly have antivirus software running in the background , which slows them down . 	Macs do n't get viruses as often and thus run more smoothly
If there exists a mechanism , like the national lottery , whereby a government can raise its revenue outside of having to directly tax its population , it is obligated to do so . Direct taxation is a burden on the population , reducing discretionary spending ; therefore governments should constantly be seeking to placate its populations by reducing the proportion of state revenue that comes from direct taxation . A study by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries found that lottery sales raised $ 52.6 billion for states in 2005 . If the state 's obligation is to look after the general interest of its population , which lie in lower direct tax rates as a proportion of total revenue , such a lucrative revenue stream can not be ignored at the expense of maintaining direct tax rates . 	Governments should seek alternative revenue streams that do not require direct taxation
Governmental involvement is essential in ensuring that a large proportion of the money goes to help the public . For example , the London 2012 Olympics will receive around 2.2 billion pounds , providing funding for buildings such as the main Olympic Stadium . Without the National Lottery then , the Olympic Games would have been much more expensive for the taxpayer , and the country would not be able to put on the spectacle it now plans to . This is just one example of how government regulation in lotteries can ensure that the profits raised go where they are needed - people are not paying any extra to help fund projects such as the Olympic Games , but by choosing to buy a lottery ticket the government ensures that some of that money goes to useful projects . 	Governmental presence can help to regulate the revenue achieved from lotteries .
It is a widely known fact that a large proportion of the money made from selling lottery tickets goes directly to good causes and schemes run by the government to help improve the lives of the people who buy the tickets in the first place . The National Lottery -LRB- UK -RRB- was initially founded on the principle of providing funding for the arts , sport and heritage with funding for projects that would not otherwise get off the ground , and in recent years there has been a drive by the government to return the distribution of lottery money to those causes . According to the official National Lottery website , `` Camelot already runs the most cost-efficient lottery in Europe - an achievement that has helped the UK National Lottery to generate over26 billion for the Good Causes , and counting '' . This is an incredible sum of money , made possible by the fact that government endorsement allows for greater awareness of the competition meaning more players and more money going to charity . Were the lottery to be de-nationalised , there would be no guarantee of these essential donations - the lottery would simply become another form of gambling which profits the organisers above all else . 	National lotteries are also one of the largest contributors to charitable causes .
There is no getting round the fact that the amounts of money involved in most lottery systems are life changing . They are the one way in which those who are of average or low income to gain immense wealth and alter their quality of life for the better . There is good documentation of how much these people 's lives are changed - governmental involvement in this activity has no negative impacts on the individuals playing the game - indeed their regulation means that the revenue generated goes to more deserving causes than would happen were the lotteries to be privately regulated . 	Lotteries provide a unique opportunity to change people 's lives .
If a , the security situation in both Afghanistan and Pakistan will deteriorate and this is a matter of serious concern since the latter is a nuclear power . Violence in the region can only be disseminated if the Taliban feel they are not being attacked but are included ; then peace has a chance of prevailing . If the region were to be left as is Increasing Taliban activity could further destabilize the border regions of Pakistan , while attacks mounted against the Afghan interior would cause significant damage and endanger thousands of live . An entrenched Afghani Taliban could support and embolden groups with similar ideologies elsewhere in central Asia and the subcontinent . For instance , groups ideologically identical to the Taliban effectively subdued the Pakistani military in the allowing them to impose their version of sharia law and institute measures that included closing girls ' schools , banning music , and installing complaint boxes for reports of anti-Islamic behaviour . Continue with the status quo and the Taliban will simply re-conquer Afghanistan when the coalition leaves . 	The threat of Talibanization is too great under the status quo to continue with current policy .
President Obama himself has said , Ultimately as was true in Iraq , so will be true in Afghanistan ; we will have to have a political solution . At a time when fiscal policy has become a major concern among western legislatures and commentators , the increasing cost of the war is proving to be politically contentious . Therefore , a political solution to the conflict is no longer merely desirable , but necessary . Continuing the war will cost too much , both in political and budgetary terms . USA and UK have to make financial considerations in light of the continuing aftermath of the global financial crisis . One glaring estimate suggests that America will spend over 700 billion U.S dollars on the military in 2010 . The conflict in Afghanistan cost approximately $ 51 billion in 2009 and was expected to hit $ 65 billion in 2010 . The purchase of air conditioning systems for Afghani facilities accounts for more than $ 20 billion of this figure . Obama 's policy of deploying more and more troops has cost the American people significantly more than the status quo would have . Every extra thousand personnel deployed to Afghanistan costs about $ 1 billion . In the current financial climate taking on such exorbitant costs is not in the economic interest of the USA . It is not only sending troops -LRB- and reinforcements -RRB- to Afghanistan , but also the medical treatment of war veterans when they return that is costing America huge sums of money . The number of psychologically ill soldiers ; as well as those suffering from near-fatal and/or debilitating injuries is still climbing tragically upwards , furthering the cost . To top that , war veterans feel that Americans are not paid enough . Mr.Obey , Rep. John P. Murtha and Rep. John B. Larson have proposed levying an annual tax of $ 30,000 on US citizens to ` share their -LRB- the military 's -RRB- burden . 	The war is too expensive , so a deal needs to be made to end it .
African countries and in Iraq have proved that power-sharing deal works . So , it means that it is possible to find a solution for Afghanistan . For example , Iraq seems to be no need for us to prove that power-sharing has worked to greatly improve conditions in the country . Conditions that horrifically grew at an incredible pace during the war in Iraq . The Iraqi government comprises of many members of the late Saddam regime who have been granted amnesty for their crimes . Members of the Taliban can be instated in governments through power-sharing -LRB- not giving -RRB- deal ; in the same way . Talks in Kenya ensued during the Bush administration when funds for the recuperation of fourth world African affairs were channelled to the region , jointly by the USA and UK . Both Blair and Bush worked side by side with formerly corrupt and violent African leaders to pick the Countries up . South Africa , which is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank -LRB- formerly a fourth world country -RRB- is now doing better than both India and China -LRB- third-world countries -RRB- on the economic front . 	We have successful precedents in Iraq and Africa , proving that a power-sharing approach works .
The majority of citizens in the USA and the UK oppose the war in Afghanistan and want troops to come back home . As was the case in Iraq , a diplomatic solution is required to end the war as smoothly as possible . As at 12 August 2011 , a total of 379 British forces personnel or MOD civilians have died while serving in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001 . About 2000 coalition soldiers in total expired in Afghanistan . More than 1340 British soldiers have been wounded in action . U.S opinion poll proclaims that 62 % of Americans want troops home as soon as possible while the rest want a timetable for troop withdrawal . According to Michael Moore , Obama is the new war president . He needs to prove that he is a peacemaker to retrieve the support of his people . The media agrees that the war is unpopular and there needs to be an end creating sentiment like I wish they would bring them all home . Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian argues I think the people in Wootton Bassett -LSB- where UK soldiers are repatriated -RSB- are representative of a very widespread ... feeling , actually , of outrage on their behalf that is quite new in British politics . A complete withdrawal is in public demand . This requires a power-sharing deal . 	The campaign is unpopular among the majority of NATO countries citizens , so we should solve the Afghan problem in diplomatic way , specifically through a power-sharing deal with the Taliban .
No state has ever been able to impose alien political institutions on the Afghani people , whether by force or by flattery . The Russians tried and so did the British , but neither was successful . In fact , the greatest massacre of British soldiers happened in Afghanistan in 1842 . The British then awarded these tribesmen with fancy titles and the Khyber pass was thereafter protected by Pakistani and Afghan tribes -LRB- the ancestors of the Mujahadeen & then the Taliban -RRB- . The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan was thus never manned by British soldiers . More than 16,000 people had set out on the retreat from Kabul , and in the end only one man , Dr. William Brydon , a British Army surgeon made it alive to Jalalabad . The Russians threw bombs , tanks , landmines and napalm at the Afghan guerrilla army , the Mujahadeen . They killed around half a million people , injured many more but they still faced dismal defeat in the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980 's . Therefore before the situation spirals out of control , the British and the Americans should commence a power sharing deal with the Taliban . The opposition may argue that the Taliban can not be trusted . Nine insurgents are very capable of fibbing about the Pakistani intelligence . There is no way that funds siphoned off from any clandestine secret intelligence agency can realistically be traced to it . Word of mouth , especially when the mouth belongs to the enemy is rarely credible . Therefore negotiating with the Taliban directly feels ineffective . They might argue that talks solely with Pakistani-Afghan government representatives is a rather more feasible and less dangerous means of achieving the coalition 's desired end . However , such talks frequented have borne little fruit . In fact Pakistan and Afghanistan are both pushing for talks including the Taliban if any progression towards peace is to be made . The coalition 's ancestors were wise . 	Afghan history shows failings of foreign invasion , so this campaign is also doomed to failure .
Currently in the UK , purity of illegal Amphetamine is normally under 5 % , and some tablets sold as ecstasy contain no MDMA at all . Instead , drugs are adulterated -LRB- cut -RRB- with substances from chalk and talcum powder to completely different drugs . At least when drugs are legalised the state can regulate their sale to make sure that they are clean and not cut with other dangerous substances . This will minimise the risk to users . 	Drugs are safer when legal
In 2009-2010 , the tax revenue from tobacco in the UK was 10.5 billion . If the state legalizes drugs , it can tax them and use the revenue from this practise to fund treatment . At the moment such treatment is difficult to justify as it appears to be spending ordinary taxpayers money on junkies . 	Legal drugs would increase tax revenue
Individuals are sovereign over their own bodies , and should be free to make choices which affect them and not other individuals . Since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective , it is not up to the state to legislate in this area . Rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use , the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs . 	People should be free to take drugs
The Taliban gets most of its revenue from poppies , which provide the opium for heroin . They do this by intimidating local farmers who would otherwise sell their harvest at market . They then demand protection money as well , or else either another local warlord or the protectors themselves would rob the farmer . Something like 22,700 people have died in Mexico since January 2007 from gangsters who want to protect their revenue and almost the entire continent of South America , from Brazil to Colombia , has had their governments destabilised by drug lords . The hugely-costly but unsuccessful war on drugs could be ended , starving terrorists of the profits of drug production . As a result peace and development could be brought to unstable drug-producing states such as Colombia and Afghanistan . 	Drugs currently fund terrorism and regional instability
Those who want to use drugs will take them whether they are legal or not and more are doing so than ever before . In 1970 there was something like 1,000 problematic drug users in the UK , now there are over 250,000 . Legalization will also remove the glamour which surrounds an underground activity and so make drug use less attractive to impressionable teenagers . For example , statistics suggest that cannabis use in the UK declined after its classification was lowered from B to C . 	Prohibition does not work ; instead , it glamorizes drugs
The nation-state is the fundamental building block of the international system , and is recognized as such in all international treaties and organizations . States are recognized as having the right to defend themselves , and this right must extend to the possession of nuclear deterrence . Often states lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapons . This is particularly true of poor and small states . Even wealthy , small states are susceptible to foreign attack , since their wealth can not make up for their lack of manpower . With a nuclear deterrent , all states become equal in terms of ability to do harm to one another . If a large state attempts to intimidate , or even invade a smaller neighbour , it will be unable to effectively cow it , since the small state will have the power to grievously wound , or even destroy , the would-be invader with a few well-placed nuclear missiles . For example , the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 would likely never have occurred , as Russia would have thought twice when considering the potential loss of several of its cities it would need to exchange for a small piece of Georgian territory . Clearly , nuclear weapons serve in many ways to equalize states irrespective of size , allowing them to more effectively defend themselves . Furthermore , countries will only use nuclear weapons in the vent of existential threat . This is why , for example , North Korea has not used nuclear weapons ; for it , like all other states , survival is the order of the day , and using nuclear weapons aggressively would spell its certain destruction . Countries will behave rationally with regard to the use of nuclear weapons , as they have done since their invention and initial proliferation . Weapons in the hands of more people will thus not result in the greater risk of their use . 	All countries have a right to defend themselves with nuclear weapons , even when they lack the capacity in conventional weapons
The issues discussed in international forums are largely set by nuclear powers . The permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council , for example , is composed only of nuclear powers , the same states that had nuclear weapons at the end of World War II . If all countries possess nuclear weapons , they redress the imbalance with regard to international clout , at least to the extent to which military capacity shapes states interactions with each other . Furthermore , the current world order is grossly unfair , based on the historical anachronism of the post-World War II era . The nuclear powers , wanting to retain their position of dominance in the wake of the post-war chaos , sought to entrench their position , convincing smaller nations to sign up to non-proliferation agreements and trying to keep the nuclear club exclusive . It is only right , in terms of fairness that states not allow themselves the ability to possess certain arms while denying that right to others . Likewise , it is unfair in that it denies states , particularly those incapable of building large conventional militaries , the ability to defend themselves , relegating them to an inferior status on the world stage . To finally level the international playing field and allow equal treatment to all members of the congress of nations , states must have the right to develop nuclear weapons . 	Nuclear weapons give states valuable agenda-setting power on the international stage
When nuclear deterrence is an acknowledged right of states , they will necessarily be less concealing of their capability , as the deterrent effect works only because it is visible and widely known . Knowledge of states nuclear capability allows greater regulation and cooperation in development of nuclear programs from developed countries with more advanced nuclear programs . Developed countries can help construct and maintain the nuclear weapons of other countries , helping to guarantee the safety protocols of countries programs are suitably robust . This will cause a diminution in clandestine nuclear weapons programs , and will reduce the chances of weapons-grade material falling into the hands of terrorists . Thus , greater openness and freedom in the development of nuclear weapons will increase the security of nuclear stockpiles . 	Public acknowledgement of the right to nuclear deterrence will benefit the public regulation of nuclear weapons generally
Nuclear weapons create stability , described in the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction -LRB- MAD -RRB- . Countries with nuclear weapons have no incentive to engage in open military conflict with one another ; all recognize that they will suffer destruction if they choose the path of war . If countries have nuclear weapons , fighting simply becomes too costly . This serves to defuse conflicts , and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war . For example , the conflict between India and Pakistan was defused by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both sides . Before they obtained nuclear weapons , they fought three wars that claimed millions of lives . Relations between the two states , while still far from cordial , have never descended into open war . The defusing of the immediate tension of war , has given the chance for potential dialogue . A similar dynamic has been played out a number of times in the past , and as of yet there has never been a war between two nuclear powers . When states have nuclear weapons they can not fight , making the world a more peaceful place . 	Nuclear weapons serve to defuse international conflicts and force compromise
Teenagers are susceptible to changes of incentive structures insofar as they have the same cognitive abilities as adults . Even if its true that they take less account for the incentives and prefer peer recognition , they still factor in the harsh sentences . Yoper writes : a study using experimental methodology that looked at juvenile smoking behavior also confirmed that price will negatively impact their consumption Even non-consumption risky behavior was found to be responsive to incentives . Teenage pregnancies , for example , fell as welfare benefits fellbut even non-price variables affected risky teenage behavior , as teenage pregnancies declined as the incidence of AIDS grewthe econometric evidence points to the proposition that even youth are rational who respond to incentives in a consistent and measurable manner , thereby suggesting that juveniles can be deterred . 	Juveniles will be deterred by stronger punishments .
The refusal to grant prisoners the right to vote ` is not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society ' . Such societies pride themselves on the participation of all in the political process , regardless of wealth , class , gender or sexual orientation . The objective of such systems , to ensure that all views are represented fairly and voters represented equally , does not stop at the gates of a prison . Issues such as prison overcrowding and abuse by warders are not treated seriously as political issues , since those most directly affected can not vote and the public generally has little interest in prisoners ' well-being . Prisoners should also have the opportunity to influence the formation of policy on healthcare , education , the environment and all the other issues that affect the world into which almost all of them will someday be released . Prisoners are not treated as `` civically dead '' when it benefits the State : they are liable for taxation on any earnings and savings that they have . There should be no taxation without representation . 	The views and needs of prisoners should be represented in a democratic system
The right to vote is enshrined in the constitution or legislation of all democratic states and their collective parts . Governments , national and state , and their elected officials are charged with passing the changes to such documents that would permit or deny the right to vote to specific groups in society . In the United States , only two states , Main and Virginia , have laws allowing incarcerated felons to vote . In Australia , a 2008 High Court ruling passed the right to vote to all felons serving sentences of three years of less . Both examples prove the capacity of the state legislature to rule on the issue of the prisoner 's right to vote . 	The legislature of the state is charged with determining whether prisoners have the right to vote
Prisoners remain human beings . We should respect their human rights and should infringe upon their liberty as little as possible , except where it concerns the protection of the public . Denying prisoners the right to vote does not protect the public in any way and is therefore an unwarranted infringement upon the human rights of prisoners . As the U.S. Congress decreed in 1993 , ` the right of citizens to vote is a fundamental right ' . Those rights which are unalienable should not be lost when one is incarcerated . 	Prisoners retain their right to basic human rights
Many people who commit serious crimes are not sent to prison because of their age , the effects upon their dependents or the likelihood that they will not re-offend . Others committing equivalent or lesser crimes , without these special circumstances , may be imprisoned . Even if it were ever right to deprive people of the vote as a punishment , this should not automatically be associated with imprisonment , but should be decided separately , as in France and Germany . As the Australian Democrats argue , ` to deny -LSB- the right to vote -RSB- is to impose an additional penalty on top of that judged appropriate by the court ' . 	Linking a ban on voting to imprisonment is arbitrary and therefore wrong
Prisoners are more likely to ease comfortably and peacefully back into civilian life if , whilst in prison , they retain links with the democratic process . Enfranchisement confers not only self-worth and meaning within a society , but can encourage research and engagement with contemporary issues . To deny this right is to force ` the disinherited -LRB- to -RRB- sit idly by while others elect his civil leaders and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policies which will govern him and his family ' . Such an outcome conveys to prisoners that not only they committed a crime , but that they committed that crime because they were incapable of acting in a manner fit for society . Mistakes made by otherwise altogether rational , beneficial members of society should not be punished by preventing their say in how that society is run . 	Prisoners are less likely to re-offend if encouraged to participate in the civic process as part of their rehabilitation
The Lisbon Treaty significantly affects the workings of each member country . It gives the European Union a legal personality , allowing it to sign international agreements and member countries are now made subject to majority voting -LSB- 1 -RSB- . The Lisbon Treaty does not only affect international policies , criminal law and national justice systems , it also gives power over to the Commission and European Court . Such major changes must be put to popular vote , the citizens of each EU member state have a right to legitimise or reject these changes that push for a more centralized European superstate . Furthermore the will of the people needs to be trusted , if a reform is intentionally ambiguous and complicated , which was one of the criticisms of the Lisbon Treaty -LSB- 2 -RSB- , it is the job of the politician to explain the cause to the public . Voters should be included in the debate and key issues need to be highlighted not just ignored . -LSB- 1 -RSB- European Commission , , viewed on 13 June 2011 -LSB- 2 -RSB- Foley , Kathy , Lisbon treat : yes , no or eh ? , -LRB- 13 January 2008 -RRB- . 	Major changes need to be put to the people and the people must be trusted .
Decisions that affect the national sovereignty of a country should not just be left to elected politicians who have power for a limited time but should be given to the citizens through direct vote . The nature of the Lisbon Treaty changed the relationship between member states and Brussels ; it is clearly a constitutional issue and therefore needs to be ratified by all citizens . The Blair Labour Government held referenda on a whole range of constitutional changes , including not only devolution in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , but even on whether individual cities should have directly elected mayors 	Reform treaties are too important to be left to politicians of the day .
When asked why they rejected the referendum for the Constitution the French and Dutch public said that they had not been consulted before on EU integration and thus felt alienated from the European union . Citizens of Europe will continue to feel alienated from the EU unless their government allows them greater participation . In Britain Tony Blair 's Labour government promised a referendum for the proposed EU Constitution so that the British people could ` make an historic choice about the UK 's place in Europe ' , this was met with cross-party and public support as this is the first time that British voters have been asked their opinion since the 1975 referendum on EEC membership . 	Citizens feel alienated from the EU , holding a referendum would encourage inclusion .
The Lisbon Treaty and the Constitution have 96 % of the same text . Former French PresidentValry Giscard dEstaing , who wrote the original EU Constitution , has publicly stated that the Lisbon Treaty is essentially the same as the proposed Constitution -LSB- 1 -RSB- . The decision from countries not to hold referendums in 2007 that they had previously agreed to is a flagrant disregard for the wishes of the people . Moreover the decision to ratify the Lisbon Treaty through national parliaments in France and the Netherlands where the 2004 Treaty was rejected in popular vote demonstrates that the decision not to hold referendums was in the fear that they would be rejected when put to the people . Any decision that is forced through parliament in the fear that it would fail when opened to the citizens of that country lacks legitimacy . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Valry Giscard d'Estaing : The EU Treaty is the same as the Constitution , -LRB- 30 October 2007 -RRB- , viewed on 13 June 2011 	The decision not to hold a referendum directly ignores the wishes of the people and is therefore undemocratic .
When society has to step in and provide for those who 've proved themselves unable to provide for themselves that should reasonably create certain expectations on the part of those being helped . In almost every aspect of life , money is given in return for a product , service or behavior . It is the same with welfare payments ; money in exchange for children being put in school . We expect parents to do a good job in their role as parents . Ensuring that their children attend school is a crucial part of parental responsibility . Children on welfare in the US are 2 times more likely to drop out of school , however studies have shown that children who are part of early childhood education are more likely to finish school and remain independent of welfare . Thus , when a parent is a welfare recipient , it is entirely reasonable to make it conditional on sending their kids to school . If tax payers ' dollars are being spent on those who can not provide for themselves , there needs to be a societal return . One of the greatest complaints about welfare is that people work hard for the money that they earn , which is then handed to others with no direct benefit to society . If children of people on welfare are in school it increases the likelihood that they will finish high school , maybe get a scholarship and go to college , and have the necessary tools to contribute to the work force and better society . 	It is morally acceptable to make welfare conditional .
In the US , girls who grow up in families receiving welfare handouts are 3 times more likely to receive welfare themselves within three years of having their first child than girls who 's families were never on welfare . Children living in poverty were 2 times more likely to have grade repetition and drop out of high school and 3.1 times more likely to have children out of wedlock as teenagers . They are 2.2 times more likely to experience violent crimes . Children of welfare recipients are more likely to end up on welfare themselves . Welfare should be a hand up , not a handout that leads to dependency on the state . It is the latter if we are only leading people to fall into the same trap as their parents . Education is the way to break the vicious cycle . Through education , children will acquire the skills and qualifications they need in order to obtain gainful employment once they reach adulthood , and overcome their condition . In the developing world , primary education has proven to reduce AIDS incidences , improve health , increase productivity and contribute to economic growth . School can empower children , and give them guidance and hope that they may not receive at home . Getting kids in school is the first step to equipping them with the skills to better their situations , and if encouraged by their parents they might consider scholarships to college or vocational school . The program does not guarantee this for all , but it is likely more effective than the leaving parents with no incentive to push their children . Benefits are supposed to promote the welfare of both parents and children . One of the best ways to ensure that welfare payments are actually benefiting children is to make sure they 're going to school . This is simply providing parents with an extra incentive to do the right thing for their children and become more vested in their kids ' education . 	Requiring school attendance allows welfare to be the hand-up that it is meant to be , and keep children out of crime .
The main goal of this program is increasing school enrollment overall . If it was too much to expect from families , then the program would have failed in the cases that it was instituted . However , the opposite has been the case . 12.4 million families in Brazil are enrolled in a program called Bolsa Familia where childrens attendance in school is rewarded with $ 12 a month per child . The number of Brazilians with incomes below $ 440 a month has decreased by 8 % year since 2003 , and 1/6 of the poverty reduction in the country is attributed to this program . Additionally it is much less expensive than other programs , costing only about .5 % of the countrys GDP . Considering that this program has been affordable and successful in both reducing poverty and increasing school enrollment it is worth using as an incentive in more programs around the world . 	The policy has been effective in the past
Parents on welfare benefits are the most likely to need the extra inducements . They generally tend to be less educated and oftentimes be less appreciative of the long-term value of education . In the late 90 's , 42 % of people on welfare had less than a high school education , and another 42 % had finished high school , but had not attended college in the US . Therefore they need the additional and more tangible , financial reasons to send their children to school . Children living in poverty in the US are 6.8 times more likely to have experienced child abuse and neglect . While attendance might not be a sufficient condition for academic success , it is certainly a necessary one , and the very first step toward it . Some parents might be tempted to look at the short-term costs and benefits . Sending a child to school might be an opportunity cost for the parents as lost labor inside or outside the homes -LRB- especially in the third world -RRB- the household , or as an actual cost , as paying for things like supplies , uniforms or transportation can be expensive . Around the world there are an estimated 158 million working children , who often need to work to contribute to their family 's livelihood . In the UK it is estimated that sending a child to public school costs up to 1,200 pounds a year . If they lose money by not sending children to school , this would tilt the cost-benefits balance in favor of school attendance . '' > -LSB- Accessed July 13 , 2011 -RSB- . 	Parents on welfare are more likely to need the incentives to take on the costs of sending children to school .
It is ridiculous and clearly unfair that some sixteen year olds should get to vote in an election while most are barred from participating . This is the case in European Parliament elections at the moment ; young people in Austria are able to vote in elections at 16 while everyone else has to wait until they are eighteen . This means that a tiny minority of the Youth in the European Union get to vote before the rest something which is clearly discrimination against the majority of the European Unions 16 and 17 year olds ; universal suffrage should be universal for the European Parliament across the whole of the Union . The age should therefore be lowered to sixteen so that voting age is universally recognised with no one group receiving the right to vote before the others . European Parliament , About Parliament - Members , , , accessed 3 May 2013 	The voting age should be the same across the Union
There would be clear advantages in having elections while young people are still in school as school could help prepare them for the elections . Schools would be able to teach their students in advance what the ballot is like , about the process of voting , and most importantly about the European Union and the function of the European Parliament . One of the biggest problems with the European Parliament is that voters dont understand what it does . To take a couple of basics from a Eurobarometer poll in 2011 , 42 % of European citizens did not know MEPs were directly elected and 57 % did not know that they sit in the Parliament according to ideology not nationality . This shows how necessary education about the European Parliament is . Having elections at 16 provides an ideal opportunity as it means that most will participate in a European election while they are at school . Teaching about why voting matters would also help to improve turnout . When Austria reduced its voting age to 16 it was found that turnout from 16-17 year olds was significantly higher than turnout for 18-19 year olds when both groups are first time voters . This suggests that 18 may simply be the wrong time to introduce people to voting for the first time . Since voting or not voting tends to be habit forming lowering the voting age could slowly increase turnout across the board .

The number of different elections can be confusing ; almost everyone has three , European , National , and local , and some have others added in such as Mayoral , or regional elections . As such there is much to be gained from helping to differentiate elections by not being concerned about being allowed to vote for them all at the same age . Having elections for the European Parliament at the age of 16 would clearly distinguish the elections from all the other elections within the country -LRB- with the exception of Austria -RRB- . For the European Union this would be an opportunity to show that it cares for the youth vote and has their issues at heart as it is a chance to get teenagers involved in Europe before they can be involved in their own national elections . For the teenagers it provides a chance to engage with one election , and one electoral system , before all the others helping to keep things simple . 	It would help distinguish between levels of elections
Young people are not well represented in European national parliaments either in terms of the membership of those parliaments or the policies they produce . The average age in the Bundestag is 50 and it is similar in most parliaments . Youth unemployment in Europe for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 23.2 % , almost twice the unemployment rate as a whole . This is because many countries do not implement youth friendly policies ; northern countries like Germany are determined to impose austerity which increases unemployment , while southern countries when implementing reforms are not implementing labour reforms that would loosen the security of permanent workers in return for reducing unemployment . This may in part be a result of demographics in Europe . Europe is aging ; in 1991 19.3 % of the EU 27s population was under 14 while 13.9 % over 65 , by 2011 this had changed to 15.6 % under 14 and 17.5 % over 65 . With an increasing contingent of elderly -LRB- who are anyway more likely to vote -RRB- the influence of young voters is declining . Reducing the voting age will help to redress this imbalance .

Throughout the European Union in the Parliament elections there is a problem with protest voting . Indeed studies have found that almost 40 % of votes in European Parliament elections are protest votes ; this is clearly bad for the European Parliament as these are not the parties that the electorate really want when it comes to creating policy . It reflects the fact that voters dont believe that their vote for the European Parliament matters . Yet because voting at 16 is two years earlier than voting in most national elections voting for the European Parliament will be 16 and 17 year olds first experience of voting ; as they did not vote for the government they are much less likely to be using their vote simply as a protest against the national government . This is because it will be clear that they are not voting on the basis of national issues because they cant vote at that level . This then represents a good chance for parties to get their European policies across to the youngest voters so that they know what their vote at the European level means .

Refusing to prescribe contraceptives for girls below the age of consent assumes that no under-age girls can make an informed decision to choose a sexual relationship . Medical advice and prescriptions should be given on an individual , rather than uniform , basis . As long as these girls meet the requirements for consent laid out by the relevant medical authority , there should be no reason for contraceptives should be denied to them . The decision of whether an individual is ready to engage in a sexual relationship is a purely personal one ; refusing contraceptives places them at unnecessarily medical risk , both physically and mentally , and does not adhere to the duty of care by doctors for their patients . 	Refusing to prescribe contraceptives below a certain age ignores the principle of informed consent .
The decision to have sex is an incredibly subjective one . Some girls might be ready at 13 , others may not be ready until they are in their twenties or older . In fact , the age where girls enter puberty has become progressively younger ; so , whereas 11 might be considered an average age to begin puberty , some girls can begin puberty as young as 7 years old . However , in either case or early or of late development , the subjective decision of sexual maturity should not be permitted or outlawed by a system which takes no personal account of the individual ; the only person who can judge if they are ready is the girl herself . 	Young girls should have the right to independent choice .
Although it is almost impossible to absolutely prevent underage sex , as already shown by rising teen pregnancy rates in the US , the UK and across Europe , it is possible to encourage safe sex . Sex education programmes which teach abstinence rarely seem to deter sexual activity or prevent teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections . However , studies researching the effect of providing contraceptives in schools have found that there was no increase in sexual activity . If this principle was extended to include the many different types of contraception available by prescription , this could feasibly help to lower high teenage pregnancy rates ; for example , the prescribed pill has a higher efficiency rate than condoms , which are often available in schools or clinics but used inefficiently . Devices like the IUD also remove any problems of girls forgetting to take their pills on time . Allowing under-age girls to be able to talk to a doctor and receive the form of contraception which is best fitting for them would actively tackle rising teen pregnancy rates . 	Easily-available contraception does not increase teen sexual activity and can tackle teen pregnancy rates .
Disallowing doctors to prescribe contraceptives to young girls impedes their duties of medical ethics . The principle of beneficence instructs that doctors should do good for their patients . If a young girl is in danger of an unplanned pregnancy and the potential medical complications which accompany it , a doctor should not deny her help if she asks for it and is medically suitable for the contraceptives . For example , she must be within the parameters for weight and blood pressure to take the combined pill , without undue likelihood of blood clots and other potential risks . It is contradictory to give doctors the right to judge their patients best interests , but simultaneously prevent them from acting in their professional capacity . 	Denying contraceptives negates a doctors ethical duty to help their patients .
By visiting the doctor , young girls have more access to information which they might not get from their school sex education . Given that , in the United States , there is no federal mandate to teach sex education in public schools , and less than half of all public schools ... offer information on how to obtain birth control , it is patently clear that the current educational system fails to address the needs of young adolescents in this respect . A doctors surgery or clinic is a more private environment for young girls to ask for clarification , without intimidation from male or female peers , which encourages education and makes sure that the girls are more fully informed before they have sex . 	Easier access to prescribed contraceptives promotes information and education .
Evidence from many different disciplines shows that the Earth is very old , allowing enough time for life as it exists today to evolve and contradicting a Creationist belief in a young earth . For example , most of the stars in the sky are thousands and millions of lightyears away , which means that light took thousands and millions of years to reach us . Similarly , there are many geographic features that took thousands or millions of years to form . For example , ice cores such as those from Vostok , Antartica , give evidence of changes in climate going back 400,000 years , far older than the 6,000 or so calculated from a literal reading of Genesis . All the evidence points this way , from archaeology , geology , physics , astronomy and more . There are many different indicators that all point to an old age of the Earth .

If the press were legally obliged to go in-front of a judge before publishing stories which may potentially contain material of a defaming nature the process of news gathering would be greatly damaged . While getting the balance between immediacy and privacy is important bringing in the judiciary to look over all written material before allowing it to be published is an entirely wrong move . As well as being a affront on freedom of speech it would also overload the courts with needless work , making the system of upholding laws inefficient and costly . Media lawyer Mark Stevens states that this idea '' ... would shear the media of the ability to report matters of public interest and thus look into corruption lurking in those dark corners the rich and powerful would rather were kept out of sight '' 	It would not be practical to involve the judiciary prior to the publication of every story
The freedom of the press is protected in law throughout the world including United States where it is protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution . It is subject to defamation law but the balance is fine , moving to a more regulated system would be an attack on the ideal of a free press and all that it has achieved . The idea of a free press in a crucial lynch pin behind the concept of democracy because how can one make a truly informed decision if their information sources a forcibly limited ; on the subject of press freedom Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Physician James Currie states that : `` Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press , and that can not be limited without being lost . '' It is therefore important that the ability of the press to be truly free is not sacrificed as democracy and liberty would go with it . 	The freedom of the press idea should be upheld .
The primary role of a free press in society is to act as watchdog and hold people , governments and companies to account for their actions , as a result news media organizations have a powerful role to play in society . Due to this there is , in all western nations , some kind of regulation of the media to ensure that false or libelous claims are not unduly made . The media , under current levels of regulation , have managed to continue on in its crucial role for democracy successfully . Take for example the 2009 leak of MPs expenses in the UK that were published extensively by the Telegraph Group . Further regulation in the case of that story , in the name of controlling potential defamation , may have hindered the story coming to light and such abuses of power would have gone unchecked and continued on as normal . While occasionally claims can be unfairly made and lead to defamation on the whole maintaining the current light levels of regulation will ensure that the media can remain efficiently effective in its important role of making people accountable for their actions . 	Further restrictions on an already regulated industry would hinder its ability to hold people to account .
A ban or high restrictions is a good measure to diminish the effects of smoking in society , because unlike the spreading of information -LRB- which is usually done by schools / clubs -RRB- , governmental restrictions or a total ban will ensure the access of measures to the whole population . Through a ban on advertisement or higher taxation those citizens not involved in active educational structures get educated about the problem . Studies on the ban of advertisements show that bans actually contribute great amounts to the reduction of smokers . `` The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug , '' said Dr Douglas Bettcher , Director of WHO 's Tobacco Free Initiative . `` But comprehensive advertising bans do work , reducing tobacco consumption by up to 16 % in countries that have already taken this legislative step . '' So because these measures can drastically decrease smoking when other measures have failed , the state is right to impose bans on advertisement , higher prices or any other measures . 	Restrictions reach out to the general population
There is little doubt that smoking tobacco is extremely harmful to the smoker 's health . In the US , for example , research by the American Cancer Society suggests that tobacco causes up to 400,000 deaths each year - more than AIDS , alcohol , drug abuse , car crashes , murders , suicides , and fires combined . World-wide some 5 million people die from smoking each year - one every ten seconds - which estimates suggest will rise to 10 million by 2020 . Smokers are up to 22 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers , and smoking can lead to a host of other health problems , including emphysema and heart disease . In a democracy the people elect leaders and trust them with a term , where their duty is solely to look after the wellbeing of the country and its citizens . The politicians , having the resources and time , are well equipped to make a better and more informed decision on activities dangerous to the individual , others and the society . Therefore one of the principles is , that elected representatives have to make sure their citizens get the best possible protection in society . Even if this infringes on some of their rights . That is why taking hard drugs and breaking the speed limit are also illegal . It would therefore be reasonable to ban smoking or limit with different means the usage of tobacco - an activity which kills millions of people each year . Precedent is that if a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests , the product is immediately taken off the market . Since all cigarettes and other tobacco products are poisonous and potentially lethal , they should all be taken off the market . In short , smoking should be banned or very harshly regulated . 	The state has to take measures to protect the health of its citizens
This argument is built on the premise that a ban or higher taxation in practice will lead to less smokers , especially protecting the families of smokers and other non-smoking citizens from potential health risks and premature death . Smoking also has wider effects , not simply restricted to smokers themselves . So-called ` passive smoking ' is becoming an important issue : in a smoke-filled environment , non-smokers are also exposed to the risks associated with tobacco . Especially when it comes to homes and families there is a high likelihood of `` passive smoking '' . Research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer , even if they do not use tobacco products . Recent research even shows , that according to the Journal Archives of Pediatrics , children living in households of smokers are more prone to mental illness , depression and attention deficit disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- . So because restrictions on smoking prevent harm risks to families of smokers and third parties we should highly regulate or ban them . accessed 6 September 2011 	Restrictions benefit the health of third parties
The US Nuclear armament will be modernized along with New START . The Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal . Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process . The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $ 84 billion on the Energy Department 's nuclear weapons complex . Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $ 14 billion to the originally proposed $ 70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl , the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in this effort . Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond . Both US Military and civilian leaders insist that the new START treaty will still allow the US to deploy effective missile defenses , something which Russia was opposed to , and so will not affect US missile defense plans . The main limit on missile defense is that the treaty prevents the conversion of existing launchers for this purpose this would be more expensive than building new missiles specifically for defense purposes . Furthermore , as Joe Biden argues , New START is important to Russian cooperation on missile defense : `` This -LSB- missile defense -RSB- system demonstrates America 's enduring commitment to Article 5 of the Washington Treatythat an attack on one is an attack on all . NATO missile defense also provides the opportunity for further improvements in both NATO-Russian and U.S.-Russian relations . NATO and Russia agreed at Lisbon to carry out a joint ballistic missile threat assessment , to resume theater missile-defense exercises , and to explore further cooperation on territorial missile defensethings that were nearly unimaginable two years ago . These agreements underscore the strategic importance the alliance attaches to improving its relationship with Russia . But trust and confidence in our relationship with Russia would be undermined without Senate approval of the New Start Treaty , which reduces strategic nuclear forces to levels not seen since the 1950s , and restores important verification mechanisms that ceased when the first Start Treaty expired last December . '' In many ways , in the 21 Century having an abundance of nuclear weapons , particularly having too many , is more of a liability than an advantage . The United States will be far safer with fewer nuclear weapons in the world and a stronger , more stable relationship with Russia under New START , and this is desirable . Therefore it is clear that New START maintains the important parts of US nuclear capabilities while removing the over-abundance which may become a liability due to security and medical concerns , and so New START should be supported .

The New START treaty maintains US nuclear and missile defence .
New START will help bolster US-Russian cooperation , which is necessary for solving the problem of Irans nuclear proliferation . On Nov. 19 , 2010 , the Anti-Defamation League released a statement , which came from Robert G. Sugarman , ADL National Chair , and Abraham H. Foxman , ADL National Director : `` The severe damage that could be inflicted on that relationship by failing to ratify the treaty would inevitably hamper effective American international leadership to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons program . The Iranian nuclear threat is the most serious national security issue facing the United States , Israel , and other allies in the Middle East . While some Senators may have legitimate reservations about the New START treaty or its protocol , we believe the interest of our greater and common goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons must take precedence . '' New START is crucial in getting Russian support against Iran and other rogue nuclear states . Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force , the chief nuclear danger today comes not from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists . Given those pressing dangers , some question why an arms control treaty with Russia matters . It matters because it is in both parties ' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship . It also matters because Russia 's cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs . Russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure `` loose nukes '' in Russia and elsewhere . And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in Afghanistan , a breeding ground for international terrorism . Obviously , the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends . Any treaty must be considered on its merits . But the New START agreement is clearly in the US national interest , and the ramifications of not ratifying it could be significantly negative . As US Vice President Joe Biden argued in 2010 : `` New Start is also a cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with Russia , which have improved significantly in the last two years . This has led to real benefits for U.S. and global security . Russian cooperation made it possible to secure strong sanctions against Iran over its nuclear ambitions , and Russia canceled a sale to Iran of an advanced anti-aircraft missile system that would have been dangerously destabilizing . Russia has permitted the flow of materiel through its territory for our troops in Afghanistan . Andas the NATO-Russia Council in Lisbon demonstratedEuropean security has been advanced by the pursuit of a more cooperative relationship with Russia . We should not jeopardize this progress . '' Therefore , because New START will have significant positive consequences in terms of aiding relations with Russia , and thus in dealing with rogue nuclear states like Iran , it should be supported .

Reducing US and Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles makes for a safer world , as Dr. David Gushee states : `` The issue on the table is a nuclear arms reduction and verification treaty between the United States and Russia . The treaty , called New START , would reduce Russian and American deployed nuclear weapons to 1,550 and delivery vehicles to 700 each . This would be a 33 percent reduction in the existing arsenals , which is worth achieving and celebrating even as we know that countless cities and millions of precious human beings could be destroyed by the use of even part of the remaining arsenals . Still , these reductions would be a great step on the way to a safer world , as would the re-establishment of bilateral , intrusive verification measures for both sides , also part of the treaty . '' The world is simply a much less secure place without New Start , and not just because New START means there are physically fewer nuclear weapons and thus a lesser chance of nuclear disasters -LRB- although this in itself is compelling -RRB- . Rather , New START also has immense symbolic value , in demonstrating that the two greatest powers have enough in common and are interested enough in their mutual security that they can agree to deduce nuclear weapons together . It shows that these nations regard each other as partners for world peace , not as enemies . The alternative world , without New START , would be one in which the mutual suspicion and animosity of the Cold War might continue . It is notable that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in an interview released in early December 2010 that Russia might be forced to build up its nuclear forces against the West if the United States fails to ratify the New START treaty . The threat of Russia , or even the US , resuming nuclear build-ups is a frightening thought for both nations , for the world and for peace . On top of its other benefits , New START is key to opening Russian nuclear weapons up for verification , which contributes to trust and peace . As former Secretaries of State Kissinger , Shultz , Eagleburger , Baker and Powell argue the agreement emphasizes verification , providing a valuable window into Russia 's nuclear arsenal . Since the original START expired last December , Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal , and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections . Each day , America 's understanding of Russia 's arsenal has been degraded , and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the gaps . Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into Russia 's activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal , making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent mission . Therefore New START should be supported as it represents a positive step for peace and cooperation in the world .

In addition , the use of nuclear power reduces our foreign energy dependency . The European Union is a net importer for energy , and as such is reliant on Russia and Norway , predominantly , for oil and gas supplies . Events such as the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine over gas supplies demonstrated that the EU 's energy can easily be disrupted by political situations outside its control . It also means that the EU could be drawn into disputes between Russia and neighbouring countries because it has a vested interest in the region . This could set a dangerous precedent , where the EU could be intimidated by Russia , because the EU relies so heavily on Russian gas . Building more nuclear power stations would ensure a more secure supply of energy , thereby avoiding the potential for energy supply to become a politically charged issue on an international scale . 	Nuclear power gives countries energy security and self-sufficiency
In many senses nuclear energy is the cleanest of renewables . It does not produce emissions such as CO2 and greenhouse gases , which are harmful to the population and the environment . Roughly 700 million metric tons of CO2 emissions are avoided each year in the United States by generating electricity from nuclear power rather than some other source ; according to the U.S. Department of Energy , that is nearly equivalent to the CO2 released from all U.S. passengercars . It is true that it does produce radioactive waste but since this is in solid form it can be dealt with relatively easily and stored away from centres of population . Furthermore , as new technology becomes available to allow the more efficient use of nuclear fuel , less nuclear waste will be produced . -LRB- A recent example is the development of the fast breeder reactor , which uses fuel much more efficiently -RRB- 	Nuclear power is clean and emits significantly less CO2 than other renewable energy sources
Although EU countries are using energy more efficiently , demand for energy continues to rise , especially in the new eastern European member states . The demand for electricity is expected to rise by 8-9 % by 2020 meaning a much more urgent need for generating capacity . At the same time world energy consumption is projected to expand by 50 % from 2005 to 2030 leading to high oil and gas prices . The production of renewable energy is not growing at a fast enough pace to replace fossil fuels ; wind , wave and solar simply can not provide the quantities of energy required . It is possible indeed , desirable - to combine nuclear power with other renewables , but nuclear energy is a crucial part of that mix as the only option capable of producing the quantity of energy required . Nuclear power is actually more efficient than any other power source : a gram of uranium 235 contains as much energy as four tons of coal . 	Energy demands are increasing exponentially and nuclear power is the only renewable source capable of matching it
Nuclear power is the most practical renewable energy source as all the others face major difficulties either in scaling up to provide enough to be a major component of nations energy mix , do n't provide energy all the time , the ` base load ' , or cause other environmental problems . Nuclear is a proven technology with large firms that can build large amounts of nuclear energy generation capacity . The most efficient source of renewable energy has been hydroelectric power , however , this usually creates more problems than it solves . Building a large dam necessarily floods an enormous region behind the dam which in turn can displace thousands of people . There are also enormous ecological costs to dam building . A classical example is the Aswan dam in Egypt along the Nile . Not only did many thousands lose their homes but the yearly inundation of the Nile , which fertilised the surrounding land for thousands of year , was also stopped ; the subsequent silting up of the river destroyed much wildlife . A similar story of ecological destruction and human homelessness surrounded the more recent Three Gorges dam project in China . Wind , tidal , and solar power are all affected by issues of reliability . The tendency of wind power , in particular , to be a volatile source of energy , means that other power sources such as fossil fuel power stations have to make up the shortfall when wind levels drop . Tidal power technology is still in at an early stage and may take years to become profitable . It also has the potential to cause environmental problems in the marine environment . For a large area of the European Union , there is not the potential to exploit solar power as there are not enough hours of sunlight . `` Wind and solar power have their place , but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply ca n't replace big baseload plants such as coal , nuclear and hydroelectric . Natural gas , a fossil fuel , is too expensive already , and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants . Given that hydroelectric resources are built pretty much to capacity , nuclear is , by elimination , the only viable substitute for coal . It 's that simple .

Intellectual property rights systems create perverse incentives in firms , leading them to inefficiently allocate resources . One such inefficiency arises from the duplication of effort by firms seeking to develop the same process or product , though only the first to do so may profit from it . This leads to brutal races and excessive expenditure of resources to be first over the line and to monopolize the production , at least for a time . Another serious inefficiency arises in the production of similar products to existing ones , seeking to get around existing intellectual property rights . Such has been the case for years in the pharmaceutical industry , which has succeeded in curing erectile dysfunction dozens of times . An overemphasis on such spinning off of similar products is the result of intellectual property rights perverting incentives . Furthermore , intellectual property rights create the problem of corporate espionage . Firms seeking to be the first to develop a new product so as to patent it will often seek to steal or sabotage the research of other competing firms so as to be the first to succeed . Without intellectual property rights , such theft would be pointless . Clearly , in the absence of intellectual property , markets and firms will behave more efficiently . 	Firms and individuals misallocate resources trying to race others to the same goal , and spend resources stealing from one another :
Many firms can not act independently , but rather rely on the technology and systems of other firms . The complicated , and often convoluted , licensing arrangements needed by many firms to function sap resources and effort , slowing productivity and causing general economic sluggishness . In high-tech and science research firms particularly , mutual licensing pacts are needed that often slow production and advancement due to the complicated legal arrangements that must be entered into to allow firms to go about their business . For example , the recent battle over rights to computer technology between Hewlett-Packard and Oracle , which has cost both firms millions of dollars in legal fighting . These costs are entirely mitigated in the absence of intellectual property rights , as ideas flow freely and people can go about their business without the complications of licensing . 	The complicated legal arrangements created by intellectual property raise costs of doing business :
An individual or firm with a monopoly right to the production of something may not have the ability to efficiently go about meeting demand for it . Intellectual property rights slow , or even stop the dissemination of such ideas and inventions , as it may prove impossible to sway the creator to license or to market the product . Such an outcome is deleterious to society , as with the free sharing of ideas , an efficient producer , or producers , will emerge to meet the needs of the public . A similar harm arises from the enervating effect intellectual property rights can generate in people and firms . When the incentive is to simply rest on one 's patents , waiting to for them to expire before doing anything else , societal progress is slowed . In the absence of intellectual property , firms and individuals are necessarily forced to keep innovating to stay ahead , to keep looking for profitable products and ideas . The free flow of ideas generated by the abolition of intellectual property rights will invigorate economic dynamism . Furthermore , many firms that develop and patent ideas do not share them , nor do they act upon them themselves do to their unprofitability . This has been the case with various treatments for predominantly developing world diseases , which exist but are unprofitable to distribute to where they are needed most , in part of Africa and Asia . With no intellectual property rights , the access to such drugs would be facilitated and producers interested in helping the sick rather than simply profiting would be able to help those in need left to die due to intellectual property . Stim , Rishand . 2006 . Profit from Your Idea : How to Make Smart Licensing Decisions . Berkeley : Nolo . 	Intellectual property slows the dissemination of essential information and products
An individual 's idea , so long as it rests solely in his mind or is kept safely hidden , belongs to him . When he disseminates it to everyone and makes it public , it becomes part of the public domain , and belongs to anyone who can use it . If individuals or firms want to keep something a secret , like a production method , then they should keep it to themselves and be careful with how they disseminate their product . One should not , however , expect some sort of ownership to inhere in an idea one has , since no such ownership right exists . No one can own an idea . Thus recognizing something like a property right over intangible assets is contrary to reason , since doing so gives monopoly power to individuals who may not make efficient or equitable use of their inventions or products . Physical property is a tangible asset , and thus can be protected by tangible safeguards . Ideas do not share this right to protection , because an idea , once spoken , enters the public domain and belongs to everyone . Fitzgerald , Brian and Anne Fitzgerald . 2004 . Intellectual Property : In Principle . Melbourne : Lawbook Company . 	There is no such thing as intellectual property , since you can not own an idea :
The state incurs huge costs in monitoring for intellectual property right infringement , in arresting suspected perpetrators , in imprisonment of those found guilty , even though in reality nothing was stolen but an idea that , once released to it , belonged to the public domain . The United States government , for example , projects costs of investigating intellectual property claims will cost $ 429 million between 2009 and 2013 . Firms likewise devote great amounts of resources and effort to the development of non-duplicable products , in monitoring for infringement , and in prosecuting offenders , all of which generates huge costs and little or no return . Furthermore , the deterrent effect to intellectual property piracy generated by all the efforts of the state and firms has proven generally minimal . This is because in many cases intellectual property rights are next to unenforceable , as the music and movie industries have learned in recent years . Only a tiny handful of perpetrators are ever caught , and though they are often punished severely in an attempt to deter future crime , it does little to stop it . Intellectual property , in many cases , simply does not work in practice ; firms should move with the times and recognize they need to innovate in ways that will compensate . 	Costs of monitoring intellectual property rights by states and companies outweigh the benefits , and is often ineffective :
Denying rogue states weapons is the most effective way of preventing them from posing a threat to other states or their own people . The UN , rather than individual member states , should regulate the arms trade and , in particular , restrict arms sales to rogue states . All major arms exporting countries claim they already regulate arms exports tightly -LRB- typically by a system of licensing -RRB- in order to ensure that arms do not end up in undesirable hands . However , the United States , for example , was one of the principal suppliers of arms to Indonesia under Suharto , providing training aircraft , radar equipment , spare parts and machine guns . In contrast , the UN can set up an international convention or treaty in order to prevent countries selling arms to rogue states . As has been demonstrated by the Kyoto Protocol , the UN can enforce a change in a national government 's behaviour even if it has not signed up to the treaty itself . This would be an effective way to police arms trade , as the UN Security Council would act as the authorizing body . In this way , unlike national governments , the UN would provide the correct check and balances to regulate the arms trade in an impartial and legal way . A practical solution is forthcoming ; the Arms Trade Treaty , initially put forward in 2003 by a group of Nobel peace laureates , has been voted in favour by 153 member states and is currently being negotiated . Since the inauguration of Barack Obama , the new American administration is also now in favour of the treaty . 	The UN is able to restrict arms sales to rogue nations .
Rogue states , by definition , refuse to be bound by international norms and threaten the stability of their region or even the world as a whole . By and large , rogue states are less developed countries lacking the capability to produce sophisticated weapons or even basic arms in large numbers . Trade with more developed nations is therefore their only route to acquiring a significant military capacity . The trade in small arms , in particular , is generally regarded as being a root cause of many of the conflicts in Africa , which have brought death and poverty to millions . Given that an AK47 can be bought for as little as $ 6 in some countries , it is no surprise that the civil war in Sudan lasted 21 years and cost almost 2 million lives . Furthermore , a rogue nation may use arms against its own population . Typically rogue states have poor human rights records and are willing to commit atrocities against their own citizens . Supplying them with arms gives rogue states the tools to do the job . Saddam Hussein , for example , used Soviet and western-made arms in his slaughter of the Kurds in 1991 . Similarly , US M16 machine guns were used to slaughter peaceful demonstrators in East Timor in 1991 . In light of this , it is vital that the UN takes a lead in stamping out arms sales to rogue nations 	Restricting arms sales would restrict war and oppression by rogue states .
The arms trade is a global problem which , by definition , crosses national borders and continental boundaries . To soften its impact will require more than just the piecemeal action of isolated governments . Broad international co-operation is necessary and as such the UN is the ideal forum to pursue an end to arms sales to rogue nations . Because of its global membership the UN is the only forum which can bring together the required global coalition . Furthermore , national governments are notoriously bad at obeying their own rules on the arms trade . In order to secure lucrative contracts , national governments regularly bend their rules to permit the export of arms to rogue states . Russia and the Ukraine , for example , were supplying weapons -LRB- including anti-tank missiles -RRB- to Iraq right up until the second Gulf War . Since national governments are unlikely to make ending the arms trade to rogue nations a long term priority , UN regulation is required . Unlike any national government , the UN is able to take the long view and end this appalling trade . Practically , the UN Security Council currently has the power to impose an arms embargo 	Arms trade to rogue nations is a global problem which required global solutions .
The arms trade is one of the principal sources of poverty in the world , as states spend limited resources paying for arms rather than improving the welfare of their people . This problem is particularly severe with rogue states , which typically have more enemies -LRB- both inside and outside their borders -RRB- and place less of a priority on welfare . In fact , the developing world spends about $ 20 billion a year on arms . And of course the cost of conflict is much higher . Given that a fundamental part of the UN 's mission is to improve the lives of ordinary people , it is right that it should make ending the arms trade to rogue states a priority . 	The arms trade causes poverty in the developing world .
An African state with veto power in the UNSC would have much more leverage to get African positions listened to . This is something that is particularly important as Africa is the region that is most commonly on the UN agenda . An African permanent member would likely alter the priorities of the Council for the better . It would be the first UNSC member without nuclear weapons , indeed if it were South Africa it would be a state that had given up nuclear weapons so would be in favour of disarmament . There might be more attempts to solve the root causes of conflicts rather than just providing a response when a conflict breaks out as Rwanda promoted as president of the UNSC in 2013 . An African member might also be more interested in development issues , pushing on climate change etc . . It would provide more of a view from the South .

The composition of the council is outdated and must adapt to a much-changed world in the 21st century . It is clear that there is growing discontent among African countries regarding the current structure of the UNSC . We dont understand why you have three countries out of five countries on the Security Council as permanent members with a veto coming from Europe , Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , Zimbabwes Foreign Affairs minister has said . South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane appealed for United Nations Security Council -LRB- UNSC -RRB- reforms and inclusion of Africa with at least two permanent seats , he made it clear that South Africa expects a UNSC seat when reform occurs . The United Nations is meant to present sovereign states equally . The current membership was created in 1945 when there were 51 member states ; most of them European , now there are 193 of which almost a third are African . On numbers alone in the current UNSC Africa should have between 4 and 5 members of which 1-2 should be permanent . The current distribution is selfish reflecting an imperialist past .

African countries are not the only ones who wish to have a chair at the P5 table . There are more financially and military prominent countries who also have expressed their desires for having a veto power . Among them , the most important are Germany and Japan who are , the second and third largest contributors to the UN budget . Offering an African state permanent membership to the UN , would likely offend Germany and Japan . The reason UNSC reform has not gone ahead is that all potential members have other powerful countries that would be opposed to their membership . Thus for example Japan is opposed by China . And the G-4 -LRB- Japan , India , Germany , Brazil -RRB- are generally opposed by the ` coffee club ' of 40 mid-size countries led by Argentina , Pakistan , Italy , Mexico , South Korea and Spain .

Africas goal is to be fully represented in all the decision-making organs of the UN , particularly in the Security Council , which is the principal decision-making organ of the UN in matters relating to international peace and security . In 2013 the majority -LRB- 23 out of 41 -RRB- of UNSC resolutions concerned Africa . Beyond 2013 almost 70 % of issues considered are African ; further 90 % of peacekeeping personnel are in Africa . The African continent is keen to ensure that their opinion is considered on prospective embargos and military interventions . At the moment African countries are preached to rather than consulted as equals this must change .

By the most popular definition , a state is the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a defined territory . Politicians , as the government of that state , necessarily wield the institutions of that state force . This results in the tremendous responsibility of deciding when the overwhelming power of the state is exercised . This pertains to a variety of areas , such as police action against civil unrest , the interrogation of both alleged and convicted terrorists , and economic policies that subsidize industries with state resources . While it is certainly possible to brazenly abuse this power , in many cases politicians are presented with options which are , if at all illegal , marginally so , and made with the good faith interest of the nation at heart . There are even conceivable situations in which a politician may exercise options that are clearly illegal but serve an overwhelming state interest ; consider an illegal raid on a private building in order to prevent a nuclear bomb from going off . While documented instances of policy-makers choosing not to act for a particular reason are rare , several senior CIA officials stated that they had become risk averse merely because the idea of prosecuting officials who made security policy had entered the public discourse . We ought to place politicians in a situation where the only factor in their decision-making process is what serves the public interest , rather than having to weigh what they consider to be the right action against the chance it will lead to their incarceration . Attempting to avoid this through a limited system which allowed for the prosecution of apolitical crimes but immunity for political decisions would fail to accomplish the goals of prosecution of politicians , which is primarily to protect against political abuses of state power which threaten the rights of the citizenry . Crawford , Robert , Torture and the Ideology of National Security , Vol .12 No . 1 , Winter/Spring 2010 , -LRB- A Risk-Averse CIA subsection -RRB- -LSB- Accessed 22 September 2011 -RSB- 	Politicians should be able to make difficult decisions without fear that selecting one option will lead to their incarceration .
The premier reason that most states , even those that allow for the prosecution of politicians , abstain from prosecuting them while they hold office is that being a politician is a job that requires ones undivided attention . Especially for the holders of prominent national-level offices , writing legislation , responding to crises under ones purview , consulting ones constituents , and engaging in campaign work often lead to politicians working an upwards of 12 hour day , every day . To expect politicians cope with all of these concerns will simultaneously constructing a defense against pending charges would be to abandon all hope of them serving their constituents effectively . We are rightly aggravated when politicians take extensive vacations or other extracurricular forays . Being under indictment not only consumes even more of a politicians time ; the stress it causes will inevitably seep into what remaining time they do allocating to fulfilling their duties , further hindering their performance . The impeachment proceedings for Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were so intensive that they took tremendous resources away from not only the president himself , but all branches of the federal government for several months , amidst serious domestic and foreign policy concerns such as the ongoing war in Kosovo . Condon , George E. Jr. , The Long History of Criticizing Presidential Vacations , 18 August 2011 , -LSB- Accessed September 9 , 2011 -RSB- Linder , Douglas O. , The Impeachment Trial of President William Clinton , 2005 , -LSB- Accessed September 19 , 2011 -RSB- 	Giving politicians immunity from prosecution allows them to focus on performing their duties
As noted above , the political life is steeped in difficult decisions , and some of these are bound to result in choices that are at least potentially illegal . The ability to prosecute politicians incentivizes political opponents to search out past actions by said politicians so as to immobilize them politically . Such prosecutions are therefore not motivated by concern for justice , nor are they conducive to a well-functioning , multipartisan political system wherein representatives seek to work together to achieve their political ends . In the most extreme cases , powerful politicians use prosecutions to immobilize their political opponents . 	Prosecutions of politicians are often motivated by partisan concerns .
It does tremendous damage to the public perception of a given political position to see the holder of that position on trial for criminal acts . Politicians are important role models for the populace at large , and shining light on everyone one of their misdeeds is not conducive to them playing such a role . This hurts the ability of their successors who , though completely innocent , are stepping into an institution now tainted with the image of corruption or scandal . Finally , the very process of prosecution can be damaging to the country , as citizens on opposing sides of the political spectrum disagree over the legitimacy of charges . These effects all deal real damage to the political institutions necessary for the functioning of the state . 	Seeing a politician put on trial hurts the integrity of their office .
The obvious benefit to prosecuting politicians is that it punishes and thereby deters corruption by politicians . However , this benefit can be achieved through other means . Firstly , many western liberal democracies have one form or another of removing a politician from office in the midst of their term , such as impeachment in the American system or a vote of no confidence against the government in the Westminster system . While defenders of immunity oppose impeachment as contrary to the principles outlined above -LRB- because of the effect that it may have on political duties -RRB- , this is an option that remains in cases of gross misconduct . If the political will can not be mobilized to remove a sitting politician , they are held accountable by the electorate to whom they must answer in the next election , and who will likely punish blatant misuse of political power . Even if the individual politician has reached a limit on their term of office , or does not seek reelection , they are still held in check by the damage that will be done to their party in the event of major misconduct on their part . Finally , most politicians are significantly concerned about their legacy , which is tarnished significantly by corruption even if they are never held legally accountable for it . While Nixon received a full pardon from his success , his name has become synonymous with criminality and scandal : a fate most politicians wish to avoid . Ford , Gerald R. , Proclamation 4311 , 8 September 1974 , -LSB- Accessed September 9 , 2011 -RSB- 	In the event of major abuses of power it should be the public that holds politicians to account .
Homophobia is the last respectable prejudice and should be tackled with the same passion and force that others have been , and continue to be , confronted . If the speaker had been condemning black people or women they would have been arrested for public disorder if they represented an organisation that was overtly racist , it would be quite likely to be banned . For some reason Churches that hold views on homosexuality that are comparable in their vitriol to those on race held by neo-Nazi groups are not only tolerated but frequently supported by the state . Hatred is hatred and there is no reason why homophobia should be given a free pass that would not be given to racism or sexism . All of the Abrahamic faiths have , at their core , an authority focussed on maintaining the natural order . From the fourteenth century on although interestingly less so before that point homosexuality has been singled out as one of the gravest of sins , with the Catechism identifying it as one of four sins that calls out to Heaven for vengeance . That is not merely offensive but dangerous in a modern society . Boswell , John , , Harper Collins , Chapter Eight . 	Ill-informed prejudice has no place in society . The veneer of religion has been used to justify hatred , prejudice and division and should be confronted .
Free speech must come second when there is the potential for that speech to cause harm . The mantra of With God on our side has been used , and continues to be used , to justify massacre and barbarity throughout history . Although it is rarely the prelates and preachers who do the killing the certainty they promote gives surety to those who do . The purpose of the Act used in this particular case was an entirely practical one . Its main role was to tidy up existing legislation on rioting and public disorder but one section recognised that homophobic and racist language do lead to violence . It is all well and good to talk of freedom of speech but the reality is that homophobic speeches , particularly those of a religious nature , may well lead to violence . For example in New York there were a series of homophobic attacks after anti-gay statements by republican politicians . Preventing hate speech helps prevent that violence from occurring so justifying restrictions on freedom of speech . . 	Because religion promotes certainty of belief , divinely inspired hatred is easy to use to justify and promote violent actions and discriminatory practices .
Views on issues such as abortion , women , and what constitutes an acceptable family expressed by those who are extremely religious are simply bigoted views which are given credibility by being wrapped in a cassock . It is in the nature of religious belief that any set of views can adopt a religious justification and there is no objective measure against which to hold the views . For example the homophobic views which have common currency in many churches can be contrasted with a gay liberation trend discernible in others . In the light of this , it makes sense to judge the views on their own basis , regardless of the religiosity surrounding them . The views expressed by Harry Hammond , and others , need to be stripped of their religious veneer and shown that at their heart they are simply offensive . There is absolutely no reason why LGBT people should have to endure vitriol and condemnation as they go about their daily lives . It is a useful exercise to consider how we would respond to a secular speaker saying that the actions of two people who were in love with each other should condemn them to torment and suffering . Oddly however , the moment this is done in the name of God , it somehow becomes acceptable . 	Religion simply justifies reactionary views which many find offensive . There is no reason for vitriol to be tolerated just because it presents a mask of religion .
Palestinian refugees represent the longest suffering and largest refugee population in the world today . During the creation of Israel in 1948 , approximately three quarters of a million Palestinians were forced to become refugees . Together with their descendants , more than 4.3 million of these refugees are today registered with the United Nations while over 1.7 million are not . Approximately 32,000 Palestinians also became internally displaced in the areas occupied in 1948 . Today , these refugees number approximately 355,000 persons . Despite the fact that they were issued Israeli citizenship , Israel has also denied these refugees their right to return to their homes or villages . The fact that these refugees are forced by Israel to continue living abroad , mostly in refugee camps , further harms Palestinians by denying them the right to self-determination in their homeland which they were expelled from . The 1993 Vienna Declaration , which reaffirmed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter -LRB- and so sets the standard in current international law -RRB- , unequivocally gives all peoples the right to self-determination : `` All people have the right to self-determination . Owing to this right they freely establish their political status and freely provide their economic , social and cultural development ... World Conference on Human Rights considers refusal of the right to self-determination as a violation of human rights and emphasizes the necessity of effective realization of this right '' . By this measure , the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination in their homeland , allowing them to establish an independent state if they wish , any suppression of that right should be seen as a human rights violation . Therefore Israel 's denial of the Palestinians right of return harms the Palestinians , and so it should be ended . Al-Awda - The Palestinian Right of Return Coalition . `` Factsheet '' . Al-Awda - The Palestinian Right of Return Coalition . United Nations World Conference on Human Rights . VIENNA DECLARATION AND PROGRAMME OF ACTION . United Nations . 14-25 June 1993 . 	Denying the right to return harms Palestinians
Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that `` Everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . '' This right clearly applies to the Palestinians , as shown by UN General Assembly Resolution 194 : The General Assembly , Having considered further the situation in Palestine ... Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date , and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which , under principles of international law or in equity , should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible . '' This resolution was further clarified by UN General Assembly Resolution 3236 which reaffirms : `` the inalienable right of Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted , and calls for their return . '' Israel itself accepted Resolution 194 when it was allowed to join the UN on the condition that it accepted this resolution . Israel 's own laws recognise the importance of the ` right of return ' to a people in general through the fact that Jews are allowed to emigrate to Israel under Israel 's Law of Return , even if their immediate ancestors have not lived in the area in recent years . The fact that , conversely , Palestinian people who grew up in the area and whose immediate ancestors had lived there for many generations are forbidden from returning is thus a huge injustice even from Israel 's own legal perspective . Moreover , this right of return applies not just to Palestinians as a group but also individually to all Palestinian refugees themselves . On March 15 , 2000 , a group of 100 prominent Palestinians from around the world expressed their opinion that the right of return is individual , rather than collective , and that it can not therefore be reduced or forfeited by any representation on behalf of the Palestinians in any agreement or treaty . They argued that the right to property ` can not be extinguished by new sovereignty or occupation and does not have a statute of limitation . ' Therefore the Palestinian right of return has a clear basis in international law , including in Israel 's own law , and so it should be recognised .

Palestinians have a right to return under international law
Especially in the 1948 War , Palestinians were forcibly removed from their homes and towns en masse by the Israeli Defence Force -LRB- IDF -RRB- . The traditional Israeli point of view arguing that Arab leaders encouraged Palestinian Arabs to flee is simply untrue . In fact , Arab leaders intended for the Palestinian Arab population stay put . Historians such as Benny Morris , Erskine Childers , and Walid Khalidi state that no evidence of widespread evacuation orders exists , and that Arab leaders in fact instructed the Palestinian Arabs to stay put . . According to Morris , whatever the reasons driving many into flight , temporary evacuation under local orders , contagious panic , fear of Jewish arms , or direct expulsion , the 700,000 odd Palestinians who did become refugees acquired that status as a result of compulsory displacement or expulsion , since they were not permitted by Israel to return . -LRB- 1 -RRB- In terms of the cause of the Palestinian flight , Morris argues that `` Arab evacuees from the towns and villages left largely because of Jewish ... attacks or fear of impending attack . '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A report from the military intelligence SHAI of the Haganah entitled `` The emigration of Palestinian Arabs in the period 1/12/1947 -1 / 6/1948 '' , dated 30 June 1948 affirms that up to 1 June 1948 : `` At least 55 % of the total of the exodus was caused by our -LRB- Haganah/IDF -RRB- operations . '' To this figure , the reports compilers add the operations of the Irgun and Lehi , which `` directly -LRB- caused -RRB- some 15 % ... of the emigration '' . A further 2 % was attributed to explicit expulsion orders issued by Israeli troops , and 1 % to their psychological warfare . This leads to a figure of 73 % for departures caused directly by the Israelis . In addition , the report attributes 22 % of the departures to `` fears '' and `` a crisis of confidence '' affecting the Palestinian population . As for Arab calls for flight , these were reckoned to be significant in only 5 % of cases . This clearly demonstrates not only Israeli responsibility for the Palestinian refugees of 1948 , but also that Israel was aware of it while it was going on , thus showing that expelling the Palestinians was intentional Israeli policy . This is compounded by the fact that the dispossession and ethnic cleansing of the Arabs of Palestine was part of the Zionist project from the very beginning . Theodor Herzl , in effect the father of modern Zionism and the state of Israel , in the draft-agreement of The Jewish-Ottoman Land Company -LRB- JOLC -RRB- stated the company was ` for the purpose of settling Palestine and Syria with Jews ' -LRB- the company lobbied for approval from Sultan Abdulhameed in Istanbul in 1901 -RRB- . In Article III of the same agreement the JOLC was given the right to deport the native populations , an act aimed at legitimizing ethnic cleansing , by granting `` The right to exchange economic enclaves of its territory , with the exception of the holy places or places already designated for worship . The owners shall receive plots of equal size and quality procured by it -LRB- the JOLC -RRB- in other provinces and territories of the Ottoman Empire . '' This intentional ethnic cleansing of Arabs from Palestine can therefore be seen as part of the Zionist project to create a Jewish majority state in Israel . Therefore , to deny the Palestinian right of return is to perpetuate this injustice and allow ethnic cleansing to succeed . Israel , a state founded by refugees of ethnic cleansing and the Holocaust , should not allow such an injustice to stand any longer .

The events of the Arab Spring -LRB- and previous events such as the revolutions of 1989 -RRB- have shown that effective means of communicating are vital . In a country where people have heard only one perspective , anything that can break the monopoly is to be welcomed . As Orwell put it , ` In an age of universal deceit , to tell the truth is a subversive act ' . Community radio can both encourage an initial outpouring of democracy and , just as importantly , ensure that a diversity of opinions means that one autocratic regime is not just replaced by another . In almost all other forms of mass communication , genuinely democratic voices are easily swamped by those with either the power or the money to drown out the competition . As the focus of community radio is public service , rather than profit , responsible to and frequently produced by their listener base there do not have commercial advertisers aversion to upsetting authority either political or cultural . As a result they are free to eschew the bland lowest common denominator approach that is so typical of commercial radio . 	Community radio gives voices to the people rather than imposing those of the powerful .
Autocracy has , at its root , the premise that only one perspective , or group of perspectives is legitimate . Certain assumptions are unquestionable , certain rules inviolable and , more often than not , certain voices unchallengeable . Its all too easy for that state of affairs to be normalised . Community radio offers another voice . More to the point it offers many . As well as the value of the messages themselves , the very fact that they are there and broadcast is a powerful statement against autocratic assumptions . The process of establishing and running a community radio station is , in and of itself , a powerful fillip for community cohesion . Giving voices to communities supports them as groups in their own right ; cohesive , engaged and worthy of respect . In doing so it can provide a focus which increases the homogeneity of those communities without requiring the approval of a central structure of control . In addition to well known examples such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty , radio stations across the Middle East And , especially , Africa have been key movers in the shift to democracy . 	Community radio evens the playing field against state and corporate broadcasters .
Community radio relies on the power of its ideas and the thirst for those ideas among its audience . It accepts the notion that it is the exchange of information and views , freely given and received , that is more important than the ideas themselves . It doesnt require massive budgets and radio waves can be received on equipment that costs pennies ; more importantly it can be shared . For all of its pretensions of accessibility the devices used to access the Internet tend to be expensive and they also tend not to be shared unlike radios . To give some context to this , even paying Western prices , a small radio station can be started for as little as $ 10,000 with monthly costs of $ 1,000 . Some of that , of course , relates to government issued licences , clearly this does not apply if the station is planning to be ignored by the authorities . These costs can be further reduced when the founders have a pre-existing knowledge of radio engineering or work with a partner organisation such as the BBC World Service or the various NGOs who specialise in the field . 	Radio is cheap to produce and easily accessible .
There is a strong precedent for letting Ukraine and Georgia join NATO . Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia are also former Soviet states , and Russia objected to their entry into NATO quite as much as it objects today about its Black Sea neighbours . Yet Russia was not allowed a veto over their futures , and it soon got over its annoyance , continuing to participate in joint forums with NATO and to cooperate with the USA over Afghanistan , North Korea and nuclear non-proliferation . So NATO is already committed to the defence of states in Russias near-abroad , and should not fear further expansion . 	There is a strong precedent for expansion
Many people in both Ukraine and Georgia wish to join NATO , and that is the best reason for welcoming them into the alliance . NATO is an alliance of democratic states and should respond positively to the request of a sovereign nation . In Georgia a non-binding referendum on whether to join NATO showed 77 % of voters in favor of joining . Polls show that some 50 % of Ukrainians in 2002 said that would support Ukraines membership in NATO if a referendum on this issue were held . Both states are at risk of being pushed around by Russia , partly because their desire to adopt western democratic values is at odds with the more autocratic values of Russias leadership . They also fear that Russia has designs on their territory and sovereignty , knowing that many in the Russian elite have never fully accepted the collapse of the old Soviet Union . These fears have been realised with Russian forces in South Ossetia , Abkhazia , and Crimea . Joining NATO offers Georgia and Ukraine the protection of a proven alliance and a clear route to European Union membership that has already been travelled by other former Soviet states . Ukraine and Georgia as European states have a right to join NATO if they would satisfy all criteria for NATO membership . 	The people of Ukraine and Georgia want to join
Expansion to include Georgia and Ukraine is in the interests of NATO . After more than a decade without a clear role , the alliance now once again stands for the principle of solidarity between western liberal democracies . The hopes of the 1990s for a new world order in which a democratic and liberalising Russia would see partnership with NATO and other western clubs as strongly in its own interest died during the Presidency of Vladimir Putin . Russia once again poses a threat to Europe and needs to be contained or at least shown that NATO has not forgotten about it . This is shown by President Putins continuing lashing out at foreign countries for funding NGOs and plans to boost defense spending . Extending NATO up to Russias southern border will signal the Wests strength and determination and force Russia to respect the alliance and its members . 	Expansion is in the interests of NATO
We already set boundaries on what constitutes free speech within our society . For example , we often endorse a balancing act an individual may express their beliefs or opinions , but only up to the point where it does not impede the protection of other human rights other peoples right not to be abused . In this case , if an individual expresses abuse towards another especially racism - they may be deemed to be outside of the boundaries or free speech and can be punished for it . This motion is simply an extension of this principle ; the kinds of sites which would be banned are those which perpetuate hatred or attack other groups in society , an so already fall outside of the protection of free speech . The harms that stem from these kinds of sites outweigh any potential harm from limiting speech in a small number of cases . 	The government here may legitimately limit free speech .
Some governments , such as the Vietnamese government , have already seen sufficient cause to ban social networking sites such as Facebook . Recently in the UK , many major cities witnessed devastation and destruction as social networking sites were used to co-ordinate wide-scale riots which rampaged over London , Manchester , Birmingham , Worcestershire , Gloucester , Croydon , Bristol , Liverpool and Nottingham . Rioters contacted each other through Facebook and blackberry instant messenger to ensure that they could cause maximum damage , which resulted in the destruction of property , physical violence towards others , and even the deaths of three young men . These events prove that seemingly innocent Internet sites can be used by anybody , even apparently normal citizens , to a devastating effect which has caused harm to thousands . To protect the population and maintain order , it is essential that the government is able to act to censor sites that can be used as a forum and a tool for this kind of behaviour when such disruption is occurring . 	Even sites that appeared innocent have had a devastating effect on society .
Under the status quo , states already regulate other forms of media that could be used malevolently . Newspapers and books are subject to censorship , and mediums such as television , film and video receive a higher degree of regulation because it is widely recognised that moving pictures and sound can be more emotive and powerful than text and photographs or illustrations . The internet has many means of portraying information and opinion , including film clips and sound , and almost all the information found on television or in newspapers can be found somewhere on the internet , alongside the millions of uploads from internet users themselves . 	As an extensive form of media , the Internet should be subject to regulation just as other forms of media are .
In recent years , supposedly innocent sites such as social networking sites have been purposely used to harm others . Victims of cyber bullying have even led victims to commit suicide in extreme cases . Given that both physical and psychological damage have occurred through the use of social networking sites , such sites represent a danger to society as a whole . They have become a medium through which others express prejudice , including racism , towards groups and towards individuals . Similarly , if a particularly country has a clear religious or cultural majority , it is fair to censor those sites which seek to undermine these principles and can be damaging to a large portion of the population . If we fail to take the measures required to remove these sites , which would be achieved through censorship , the government essentially fails to act on its principles by allowing such sites to exist . The government has a duty of care to its citizens and must ensure their safety ; censoring such sites is the best way to achieve this . 	Governments have a moral duty to protect its citizens from harmful sites .
In the rest of the economy , when consumers are allowed to choose between goods or services , the higher quality products are successful and the bad ones fail . Similarly , when consumers can makes choices between universities , and are putting money on the line -LRB- thus taking a risk -RRB- they will choose the good universities , and consider the bad universities as not worth wasting their money on . As a consequence , the best universities will expand , and the worst universities will either improve or fail . The New College of the Humanities for example is aiming to rival Oxford and Cambridge so helping to provide these two elite institutions with the necessary competition to force up standards . This will result in a higher quality of education being available to more people . 	The introduction of more private universities would increase the quality of education by allowing open competition
The majority of people in the UK have not benefited from a university education , and graduates earn more , on average , than the rest of the population . Further , universities accept a larger number of richer people than they do poorer people . A National Audit Office report claims `` Socioeconomic background remains a strong determinant of higher education participation . People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds make up around half of the population of England , but represent just 29 per cent of young , full-time , first-time entrants to higher education . '' It is therefore wrong on principle to use tax-payers ' money to subsidise universities , because when universities are subsidised from a general `` pot '' of taxation , a redistribution of wealth occurs whereby the rich benefit at a cost to the poorer people in society . This is wrong , because we should be using taxation to attempt to mitigate economic inequality , not to exacerbate it . 	The current system constitutes taking from the poor and giving to the rich
Privatisation of universities allows for a greater range of educational provision : universities are no longer restrained by government targets and bureaucracy , and are incentivised by possible profits to set themselves apart and provide `` unique selling points '' that will gain them more students : the current system does not provide this motivation because universities receive their funding regardless of student numbers . 	The privatisation of universities encourages course-diversity and provides for students are individuals , not cattle
British universities are facing cuts in government funding and as a result there will be no new places created to cater for rising demand . Professor Steve Smith , president of Universities UK noted the fact that the budget cuts that could soar to as much as 950,000,000 over three years would decrease the quality of education whilst keeping the numbers of University places stagnant . In 2009 , 160,000 students who applied did not go to University . In 2010 , 75,000 more people applied . Governments in rich countries all over the world are facing squeezed budged over the next few years and will be unable to increase funding for universities . This leaves private universities as the only way to meet increasing demand for higher education . Shepherd , 2010 	Private universities are needed to increase the number of places for students .
People of faith attest that those beliefs determine the nature of their own identity and their place in the Universe . In the case of Nadia Eweida , at least , the employers case was based on the idea that wearing a symbol of that faith might not enhance their uniform . The difference between the significance of the claims could not be greater . Indeed , British Airways , Eweidas employer , has since changed their policy to permit staff to wear religious or charitable imagery in large part because of the absurdity of the position . The case against Chaplin was based on health and safety legislation - but not because the cross and chain posed a risk to others but to herself ; a risk she was , presumably , prepared to accept . On one hand there are individuals protecting their sincere beliefs in the most profound of issues and , on the other , managers applying what the Archbishop of Canterbury described as wooden-headed bureaucratic silliness . There is no suggestion that harm to another could have been caused here and , therefore , no reason not to respect the heartfelt beliefs of the individuals involved . Daily Mail . The Telegraph , Archbishop of Canterbury hits out at cross ban , 4 April 2010 , 	The confession of religious faith is far more important than the rather petty rules that banned the wearing of the cross .
Recognising rights when there is no inconvenience to anybody involved is verging on the irrelevant . This is , perhaps , especially true , with freedom of expression . If I recognise your right to express yourself freely - so long as I never have to see , hear or be aware of you doing rather misses the point . Likewise if the individual is free only so long as there arent any rules saying they shouldnt be , goes somewhat against the grain of defending liberties . Indeed the history of the idea that people can exercise all the freedom they like as long as its out of sight , out of mind and doesnt break any rules is not a noble one ; among other absurd forms of freedom , it was used to justify both segregation and apartheid . Although the effect and extent of the prejudice is clearly different here , the logic is the same : you are completely free to do whatever I think you should do . Having a right to freely express oneself means to do so when it is inconvenient , challenging or offensive to others . The rules being broken here were , as has already been mentioned , fairly petty and the sanctions comparatively minor although the loss of someones livelihood should not be understated . The case is important because of the precedent it sets ; what if the two women were risking not just their jobs but their liberty ? The UK considers itself to be a tolerant country . Tolerance means accepting those declarations and statements that are inconvenient . If the law is incapable of defending a statement as benign as wearing a small piece of jewellery , it is worrying to think how it would cope with something more forthright . 	Freedom of expression , like any right is fairly meaningless if its only respected when its convenient .
The UK is a nation that claims to be tolerant of all faiths and to respect religious beliefs . If that is the case then it must be accepted that the law should respect actions in accordance with those beliefs insofar as they do not harm or infringe on the rights of others . Demonstrating ones commitment to the cross is part of that faith and should , therefore be shown some respect in a religiously diverse and tolerant society . There may be more militant forms of religious profession that would be inappropriate in a workplace but wearing a simple piece of jewellery causes no harm or offence to others . Both women have stated that they felt that wearing the cross was an important part of their faith and respect for those beliefs should be shown if societys claims of tolerance and diversity are to have credibility . As with the demonstration of any right , the fact that its exercise may not be convenient does not supersede its validity . Indeed the only way of demonstrating that a society is , in fact , a tolerant one is , by definition , when it tolerates the exercise of legitimate practices which are inconvenient . Galatians 6:14 among others 	Declaration of the faith is a key part of Christianity and that should be respected .
Legislation should be consistent ; otherwise it is , by definition , discriminatory . If some faiths are allowed to show outward demonstrations of their faith in the workplace , then that should apply across the board . Christianity is an established part of the state , as shown by the monarch being head of the Church of England . So it is perverse for two national brands to accept attire that demonstrates an employees profession of other faiths but to reject one that is universally recognised as a symbol of Christianity . The very fact that both women were willing to risk , and lose , their jobs over the issue shows that they considered wearing the cross to be an important part of their faith . That should be enough to demonstrate that it is a matter of conscience . It is demonstrably true that allowing other religious symbols to be worn does not create immense difficulties , both the NHS and Heathrow airport allow sikhs to wear a kirpan -LRB- small dagger -RRB- . Their right to do so is respected because it is important to the individual concerned . The same is clearly true here . Either legislation should respect that commitment in all faiths or it should not do so in any . The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , 4 ed . , Houghton Mifflin Company , 2000 , The Kirpan , A submission to the Department of Communities and Local Government -LRB- UK -RRB- , British Sikh Consultative Forum , April 2009 , P12 	Other religions have the right to wear prescribed clothing enshrined in British law , it is hypocritical not to offer Christianity the same protection .
A tax on aviation fuel could certainly be put into effect on an international basis . Climate change is a global problem and the ICAO was tasked in the Kyoto Protocol to look at how the aviation industry worldwide could reduce emissions . As it is in the interests of all countries to tackle aircraft emissions , an international consensus could certainly be achieved given effort . Agreements on other difficult issues have been reached in the past -LRB- e.g . the Millennium Development Goals , anti-landmine treaties , the Montreal climate change conference in 2005 -RRB- . Even before international agreement is reached , groups of states could still adopt such a tax effectively . For example , EU states could apply a fuel tax to EU airlines on European flights , and extend it to non-EU airlines in Europe by renegotiating Air Service Agreements with other states . Levels of tax can be set low enough to avoid distorting travellers ' choices about where they fly . Europe is already alone attempting to impose its emissions trading scheme on all flights to European Airports showing that countries do have the will to force the airlines to compensate for their emissions , an international tax bringing in other countries would potentially be much more effective and not be seen as a unilateral move so not create protests from around the world as the ETS has . 	An tax on aviation could be adopted first by regional blocks
Taxing aviation fuel would encourage greater fuel economy by making kerosene more expensive . As the popularity of air travel continues to increase rapidly , it is important to put pressure on the aviation industry to use fuel as efficiently as possible , in order to hold emissions down as much as much as they are able to . With fossil fuel reserves running out , fuel conservation is also a wise use of finite resources . More expensive fuel would give airlines an incentive to adopt the most modern technology and update their fleets . They could also adopt flying practices aimed at maximizing fuel efficiency , such as flying at lower speeds . 	Introducing an aviation tax would increase fuel efficiency .
Flying is a major source of pollution and , in particular , of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide . The role of aircraft in climate change is worsened by the high altitude at which gases and particulates are released into the atmosphere . It is thought that the impact of aircraft emissions on our climate is two or three times greater than that of the same amount of CO2 when released by vehicles on the ground . At present , aviation fuel is largely free from taxation . Most countries do not tax it for internal journeys , and international treaties prevent taxation of fuel used for international flights . For these reasons , aviation fuel -LRB- kerosene , a fossil fuel -RRB- should be taxed , in order to make the polluter pay for the damage they cause , and to encourage a reduction in the amount of emissions . 	Taxing aviation fuel would reduce emissions .
A tax on aviation would be international in scale and provide an excellent opportunity to raise money for development aid . The European Union is considering such a plan in order to provide additional funding to ensure its Millennium Development Goals targets will be met . France , Germany , Brazil and Chile are already calling for such an initiative , and France already unilaterally introduced a levy on flights in 2006 to go to meeting the MDGs . In the long term , a global tax on aviation could be administered by the United Nations , providing it with a regular , predictable income safe from political interference . Greater UN control over development aid will also overcome current problems of duplication , favoritism and waste in competing national programs . Setting revenues from aviation aside to fund international aid will make a tax more acceptable to passengers , and will spread the burden of aid funding more fairly around the world . 	Aviation taxation will generate money for development aid .
A world government would give people a higher focus for their political loyalties than their respective nation-states , and thus facilitate the development of a higher degree of cosmopolitanism than is possible under the sovereign nation-state system . This would benefit the practical operations and effectiveness of the world government . The greater the sense of community among the citizens of a polity , the higher the effectiveness of the politys government , and the higher the effectiveness of the politys government , the greater the sense of community among its citizens . This suggests an interactive , snowballing relationship over time between the sense of community of the citizens of the world federation , and the efficiency and effectiveness of its practical operations . From relatively low sense of community and low effectiveness in its early stages , over many years of gradual evolution , the world federation would eventually achieve a very high level of community spirit and practical effectiveness . 	A world government would foster a constructive cosmopolitanism
Ever since the destruction of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 during the closing days of World War II , the threat of global devastation through nuclear world war has hung over human civilization like a Damocles sword . The threat of global nuclear destruction peaked during the most perilous years of the Cold War during the 1950s through the 1970s , and it gradually subsided thereafter . With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s , many people came to believe that the threat has entirely disappeared . But this is false complacency . Although national arsenals of nuclear-tipped ICBMs have declined in the two decades since the end of the Cold War , they still exist at levels that would cause unimaginable death and destruction were they unleashed in a world war . The history of human civilization throughout the ages demonstrates the strong propensity among human beings toward hostility , violence and warfarewhatever the potential cost . As long as the international political system is based upon the sovereignty of nation-states , the threat of nuclear world war will always be there . 	A world government would reduce the probability of a catastrophic nuclear world war
Economic interaction among the nations of the world , in the form of trade , investment and migration , has reached such a point today that it is meaningful to think of the world economy . Economic globalization suggests the need for political globalization in the form of a world government . Following the seminal work of John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression of the 1930s , it has become widely accepted within the economics profession that a certain amount of interventionist national government policy is essential to maintaining a proper balance between the twin economic evils of unemployment and inflation . Just as judicious national anticyclical policy is beneficial to national economies , so too a judicious world anticyclical policy , as implemented by a functioning world government , would be beneficial to the world economy . A world government would also improve the overall functioning of the global economy by means of regularizing various circumstances of international economic interaction -LRB- for example , in the area of patents and copyrights -RRB- , and by working to reduce various trade impediments -LRB- such as tariffs and quotas -RRB- imposed by national governments . 	Economic globalization suggests the need for political globalization
The history of the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- in the post-World War II era provides an encouraging example of what might be done at the global level through a functioning world government . It is widely agreed among economists that the relatively high degree of prosperity and security enjoyed today by the people of the Western European nations is in no small measure the result of the gradual evolution from the original limited-purpose , six-member European Coal and Steel Community -LRB- ECSC -RRB- to the general-purpose , 27-member EU of today . In the early 1940s , many of the EU nations of today were locked in devastating warfare . The fact that these same nations are today harmonious components of a quasi-state polity demonstrates the capability of people to change their customary modes of thought and behavior when there exists a sufficient incentive to do so . 	There are successful precedents for supra-national bodies
A world government would enhance the probability that effective means will be developed and implemented toward ameliorating the global problems of resource depletion and environmental decay . In a world divided into a host of jealously independent and self-righteously sovereign nations , national leaders tend to point the finger of blame for these problems at other nations , and to resist international efforts toward resource conservation and environmental preservation . As the mutual accusations and recriminations go on and on , the problems are left to fester . If a world government existed , it might muster sufficient respect and possess sufficient authority to enable the nations to arrive at a workable consensus on how to share equitably the short-term costs and inconveniences necessary to securing long-term sustainability of resources and preservation of environmental quality . 	A world government would enhance the probability of mitigating global environmental problems
