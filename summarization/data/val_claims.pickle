p3863
sV17899_2_5
p3864
V-LRB- 9 -RRB- It has been argued that the individual healthcare mandate is authorised by the Constitution 's empowerment of Congress to regulate interstate commerce -LRB- known as the commerce clause -RRB- , however this is not true and the commerce clause does not authorize health insurance mandates .
p3865
sV17899_2_4

VWhether such a requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal , as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service .
p3869
sV17899_2_6
p3870
VAs the Congressional Research Service has written : `` Despite the breadth of powers that have been exercised under the Commerce Clause , it is unclear whether the clause would provide a solid constitutional foundation for legislation containing a requirement to have health insurance .
p3871
sV17899_2_11
p3872
VThus , for example , there is no problem , Constitution-wise with having Congress regulate health care insurance transactions .
p3873
sV17899_2_10
p3874
VThere is no doubt that Congress can regulate an entire array of economic activities , large and small , inter - and intra-state .
p3875
sV17899_2_13
p3876
V-LRB- 8 -RRB- While most health care insurers and health care providers may engage in interstate commerce and may be regulated accordingly under the Commerce Clause , it is a different matter to find a basis for imposing Commerce Clause related regulation on an individual citizen who chooses not to undertake a commercial transaction .
p3877
sV17899_2_12
p3878
VThe problem with an individual insurance purchase mandate , however , is that it does not regulate any transactions at all ; it regulates human beings , simply because they exist , and orders them to engage in certain types of economic transactions .
p3879
sV17899_2_15
p3880
V-LRB- 6 -RRB- If Congress were to invoke its Commerce Clause authority to support legislation mandating individual health insurance coverage , such an action would have to contend with recent Supreme Court precedent limiting unfettered use of Commerce Clause authority to police individual behaviour that does not constitute interstate commerce : In the case of a mandate to purchase health insurance or face a tax or penalty , Congress would have to explain how not doing something not buying insurance and not seeking health care services implicated interstate commerce .
p3881
sV17899_2_14
p3882
VThe decision not to engage in affirmative conduct is arguably distinguishable from cases in which Commerce Clause regulatory authority was recognized over intra-state activity : growing wheat , for example , -LRB- Wickard v. Filmore -RRB- or , more recently , growing marijuana -LRB- Gonzales v. Raich -RRB- .
p3883
sV17899_2_16
p3884
V-LRB- 6 -RRB- Therefore , it is clear that Congress is not empowered to regulate the choice not to buy healthcare , as it lacks constitutional authorisation to interfere in this aspect of individual Americans private lives .
