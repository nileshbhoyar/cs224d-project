underworld rise of the lycans Compared to its sister films , the storytelling is stellar , remarkable not because there 's a whole lot going on -- in fact , you 'll likely leave the theater thinking , `` That 's it ? '' -- but because what little does happen makes sense . Borrows from 'Romeo and Juliet , ' 'The Passion of the Christ ' ( there are two , count 'em , two gory scourging scenes ) and , especially , 'Spartacus ' ... At least we 're spared a lot of the `` legacy this '' and `` prophecy that '' stuff that slows down both of the previous Underworld adventures . Parental Content Review Directed by former special effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos , it is shoddily paced and appears to have been lit with a candle , presumably to hide its obvious budget shortfalls . The creators seem to have abandoned all hope of manufacturing anything that 's even coherent , let alone imaginative . A period piece that drips mediocrity from the minute it begins . Enquanto seus realizadores contam o dinheiro que ganharam com o projeto , farei o mesmo que fiz com relao aos dois primeiros captulos : publicarei este texto e esquecerei imediatamente do filme que o tornou necessrio . It may be a definite upswing in quality for the series , but if you thought the previous two films were overblown goth-horror nonsense , Rise Of The Lycans really is n't going to change your mind ... Nothing special , but it convincingly transports viewers into its Medieval realm of vampires vs. werewolves . 	Despite the best efforts of its competent cast , Underworld : Rise of the Lycans is an indistinguishable and unnecessary prequel .
anonymous 2011 All in all the dreary script creates a glass ceiling that the film could never bust through , more laugh-inducing than controversy-inspiring . The coolest element of the whole thing is probably the way the movie ties art ( specifically those plays ) and politics together . I have to give special mention to actor Edward Hogg , who apparently thought he was playing Count Rugen in `` The Princess Bride . '' From the man who brought you Godzilla and 2012 ... a loud and ludicrous historical rewrite about the supposed hidden authorship of Shakespeare 's plays The very qualities that fuel the historical hokum of Anonymous -- over-the-top royal intrigue and incest , violent literary backstabbing , frothing conspiracy -- also happen to make for wild entertainment . Apart from these few light moments , Anonymous is a case of ingenuity wasted on an unintelligent enterprise . Emmerich takes on the Bard , as you like it ! Anonymous is a fun costume drama , and one of Emmerich 's better films . In a movie that rings false at every turn , Ms. Redgrave 's Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal . Anonymous leaves us longing that [ its scenario ] is incorrect , if only for the fact that the popular view of Shakespeare 's authorship is at least an interesting one . 	Roland Emmerich delivers his trademark visual and emotional bombast , but the more Anonymous stops and tries to convince the audience of its half-baked theory , the less convincing it becomes .
blue velvet shocking , perverse , funny , unsettling , scathing , biting , and twisted , but undeniably original The modest proportions of the film are just right for the writer-director 's desire to investigate the inexplicable demons that drive people to deviate from expected norms of behavior and thought . One of the most original , invigorating films I 've ever seen . It feels as `` out there '' as ever , and there has n't been any movie since quite comparing to it , besides David Lynch ' further adventures into mind-f**king . Kinkiness is its salient quality , but Blue Velvet has deadpan humor too , as well as a straight-arrow side that makes its eccentricity all the crazier . There 's no mistaking the exhilarating fact that it 's one of a kind . To watch [ Lynch 's ] 1986 neo-noir masterpiece Blue Velvet is to be plunged headfirst into the mind of an extraordinary filmmaker ... who made one of the finest dissections of the American mythos yet seen . One which David Lynch fans will want to watch over and over in HD , and which non-fans ought to see at least once . I loved the film for its intransigencies . The movie does n't progress or deepen , it just gets weirder , and to no good end . Whether you are attracted or repelled by Lynch 's bizarre vision , one thing is for sure : You 've never seen anything like it in your life . 	If audiences walk away from this subversive , surreal shocker not fully understanding the story , they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling .
the queen of versailles An outrageous , despicable , guiltily hilarious and appropriately superficial good time . [ VIDEO ESSAY ] There 's quiet satisfaction is watching the financial collapse of the Florida billionaire self-professedly `` personally '' responsible for George W. Bush 's `` illegal '' takeover of the White House in 2000 . Strangely entertaining and revealing documentary about a culture obsessed with money and people aspiring to a life they ca n't afford . Greed is good once again if you can borrow enough money to consume all you desire . Mind the debt gap . `` The Queen of Versailles '' is beautifully constructed and frequently uproarious . It 's like a champagne bath laced with arsenic . Never has grotesque wealth looked so unenviable , or its removal been so entertaining , as in this garishly watchable riches-to-rags documentary ... Illuminating , oddly hilarious , ceaselessly watchable . `` The Queen of Versailles '' ought to be required viewing for anyone who blames the rich for yanking the rug out from under America 's economy . Dig into your popcorn , and get ready for some snide schadenfreude . [ Siegel ] is now suing Greenfield for `` misrepresentation '' . Well , I know whose side I 'm on . 	The Queen of Versailles is a timely , engaging , and richly drawn portrait of the American Dream improbably composed of equal parts compassion and schadenfreude .
sharkwater Sharkwater is fascinating both as political statement and beautifully filmed documentary . Sharkwater has a message or two or three ; its intentions are nothing if not noble . ecological alarm clock once again rings in 2007 While it 's true that documentary filmmaker Rob Stewart comes on with an onslaught of zeal over his legendary subject , sharks , it 's also true that he proves he 's no `` Grizzly Man '' taking up with bears in the wild . The film does what it 's supposed to , inspire outrage . But still , Jaws will never have the appeal of those baby pandas . Rob Stewart 's visually stunning documentary makes a powerful statement about the disastrous decline of the world 's shark population and why it should -- and must -- matter to us . It 's hard not to admire a man with such admiration for the obscure , but Grizzly Man did it much better . Faintly egotistical biologist-turned-filmmaker Rob Stewart spent four years making this investigative doc and the result , despite his tendency towards over-earnest , stoner-esque commentary , is enlightening , shocking and more than a little worrying . It 's a film you come away from feeling that you should get out there on the streets and start marching for sharks . How strange to gaze upon the jaws of the most feared creatures on Earth , and to contemplate how they are no match for the teeth of man . 	In addition to its breathtaking underwater photography , Sharkwater has a convincing , impassioned argument of how the plight of sharks affects everyone .
the skeleton twins Suicide is no laughing matter , but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie-pic about self-destructive siblings . Even with performers as likable as Hader and Wiig , and characters as likable as Milo and Maggie , sympathy should be earned . Like an cocksure banker , Johnson takes our investment for granted . The actors have an obvious rapport . It 's deep enough to evoke the ties , entanglements and bloodletting of a real kinship . But Wiig and Hader 's instincts as entertainers are keen enough to know when to stop cutting . A brief , grounded , entertaining comedy with a few rich characters , a few thin ones and some unachieved ambitions . Twins is approachable and meaningful , confronting an impossible darkness with a generous flow of humanity . It 's a beautiful picture . This a strong feature that successfully blends comedy and drama while also exploring a very tough subject . Dark secrets are revealed and raw emotions laid bare in this hard-hitting and moving film in which an indestructible bond between twins is both the trigger and the solution It does n't trivialize the mental anguish that both of its characters feel , yet also does n't settle for a cheap resolution . How can you hate a movie that has a giggly Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig making fart noises at each other ? Some weeks at the movies are like this . You settle for wonderful actors doing some wonderful acting with scripts that support those efforts even as they limit them . 	Led by powerful performances from Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader , The Skeleton Twins effectively mines laughs and tears from family drama .
oliver and company Cute but forgettable cartoon musical ; a solid voice cast does a decent job . Ca n't compete with Disney classics , but still fun . This is a funny , enjoyable family treat . Simply put , Oliver & Company did n't work for me not because I 'm many years past my sixth birthday but because it never scared me into forgetting that fact . Why these juvenile delinquents and their even worse masters are considered appropriate material for the 3-8 set that is most likely to see this movie is a conundrum . The general quality of the animation and script would disappoint more sophisticated viewers . Much cornball adventure ensues , punctuated by healthy helpings of singing , dancing and general merriment . The computer-assisted animation is relatively stiff and inexpressive . Mostly harmless . The film offers a fanciful , lush urban setting , unusual for Disney animated features , and a couple of good songs . 	Oliver & Company is a decidedly lesser effort in the Disney canon , with lackluster songs , stiff animation , and a thoroughly predictable plot .
10010066-push One long mistake from start to finish , this is a film that never gets its rhythms or bearing right . If the words `` A bit like Jumper but not as good '' strike fear into your heart then you might want to avoid this turgid superpower stinker . What really struck me more than the plot itself was McGuigan 's amazing use of location and space ; it feels as if this movie and these characters are really living in Hong Kong . Even with all its idiosyncratic elements , Push feels like something we 've seen before . Unfortunately , said memory is of something far more fascinating and definitely more engaging . As far as I can tell , the only ability in short supply is acting . Long on style , short on substance and logic , it 's baffling and frenetic , defeated by its own chaotic cleverness . Suggestive of X-Men , The Matrix and the television show Heroes , Push is one of those time-mangling thrillers that manages to seem both complicated and superficial . What it lacks in out and out originality it makes up for with some pulsating action , vibrant cinematography and good performances from a decent cast . Push is this year 's Jumper . 'Nuff said . Set and filmed on location in bustling Hong Kong , the tight urban street and winding alleyways suit the film perfectly , but this is not enough to save Push from the Oscar season garbage dump . 	The sci-fi thriller Push is visually flashy but hyperkinetic and convoluted .
chaos2001 Works on a number of levels -- thriller , broad comedy , poignant family drama -- but goes farthest on the strength of its pungent gender satire . Affecting , brilliantly acted French-language drama . Wild , sometimes sickening but surprisingly hilarious ride that never lets up even if it does stack the deck and is overly obvious in its implications and sexual politics . Energetic , darkly funny and engaging from beginning to end . The plot twists , sneaky humor and Brakni 's strong debut bring intriguing order from this Chaos . One heck of a tale of deliciously unladylike payback . Serreau 's script is as witty as it is pointed and manages enough suspense to qualify as a thriller . The tone 's all over the place and side-plots are piled up a bit thick , but eventually it all converges towards a surprisingly satisfying and touching ending . A gripping feminist fable with a savage comic edge . An audaciously risky mixture of genres that does n't jell 	Anything but chaotic , Chaos makes a high-energy and award-worthy stab at bourgeois apathy and racial tensions in France , while musing on chance .
christmas with the kranks It 's silly and cute , consistently hitting just the right comedic note . A flat parable . No mnimo , uns 30 minutos poderiam ter ficado no cho da sala de edio . Ou uns 60 . Alis , para ser mais exato , 98 minutos . Esta seria a nica forma de salvar este projeto . Skipping Christmas will earn you a reputation as a modern-day Scrooge . Passing on Christmas With the Kranks ... makes you a wise holiday-movie consumer . Director Joe Roth misses an opportunity for true satire by making the neighbors such insanely over-the-top caricatures that the Kranks seem paragons of normality and perspective . Not since the day I read Mein Kampf and rented Shoah have I had an experience so joyless and laugh-free What better way is there to get into a festive spirit than having it crammed down your throat ? Luther says it late in the film : 'Why am I not laughing ? ' There 's no doubt that the Yuletide has been overcommercialized but that 's still no excuse for this miserable , lamebrained exercise in sloppy slapstick and silly stupidity . This holiday comedy depicts suburbia as a place where all true individualists are treated with a nastiness not in tune with the Christmas spirit . 	A mirthless movie as fresh as last year 's fruit cake , Christmas with the Kranks is a coarse , garish comedy that promotes conformity .
grudge 2 The only place Takashi does n't stuff his powdery ghosts is up a cheerleader 's skirt , surprising since there are so many of them readily available . If the Hollywood remake of The Ring spawned a short-lived interest in so-called `` J-horror , '' The Grudge 2 ought to finally end it . I 'm not sure what fans see in these movies but , whatever it is , here it is again in `` Grudge 2 . '' The movie is utter junk , suitable perhaps for late-night TV , but not for the thousands of big screens on which it opened yesterday . It is n't a bad movie , just a redundant one . The Grudge 2 , Takashi Shimizu 's wildly uneven but ambitious new film -- his second American remake -- is one of the best entries in the Japanese director 's Ju-On/Grudge series . I mean , for all I know , I could be cursed for just watching this nonsense . Wait , what 's that under my desk ? The Grudge 2 is just a mlange of images , some mildly disturbing , but mostly just variations on a theme : an unblinking eye , a spectral presence lurking in a dark corner , a sexy schoolgirl in uniform . Shimizu actually behaves as if he 's making a good movie , flexing his stylistic muscles such that you 're still jumping at ghost-moments long after you 've been conditioned to expect them . Seven films later , with the conventions of throat croaking and neck cracking having moved into camp , it 's amazing that Shimizu can still find new ways to turn the old screw . 	A diminished sequel that makes even less sense than The Grudge 1 .
1021242-thing All-time classic sci-fi still packs creepy wallop . A solid , workmanlike film that holds up better than one would expect . Lively science fiction film , with dubious politics . The overall message of The Thing emerges as distinctly hawkish . Reactionary or not , though , it 's still a masterpiece . Rather than Nyby , producer Howard Hawks is often credited for the direction of this sci-fi landmark , which features Hollywood 's first space-age monster in a decade invaded by Cold War-era aliens . The film has more frissons than most of today 's mega-budget productions , simply because it has the grace to construct a meaningful situation and coherent characters . Does n't pale in comparison to John Carpenter 's The Thing so much as offer a respectable podling alternative . Howard Hawks only produced this classic scary sci-fi feature , but it has his signature touches all over it : overlapping dialogue , smooth storytelling , compressed time and space . A perfect popcorn movie . This taut and entertaining thriller is to The Day the Earth Stood Still what Alien is to Star Trek , or the Rolling Stones to the Beatles . 	As flying saucer movies go , The Thing From Another World is better than most , thanks to well-drawn characters and concise , tense plotting .
jesus camp Ewing and Grady have created a terrific catalyst for religious and political discourse . One of the scariest movies I 've ever seen . It 's not a question of differing beliefs ; it 's a question of a separate society that will not accept differing beliefs The most chilling horror movie of the year . Camp , pardon the pun , is preaching to the converted , and it is n't strong enough to sway anyone sitting on the fence . Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady let the details speak for themselves . Perhaps Jesus Camp will awaken some slumbering minds to two truths on which both sides of this religious debate might agree . A brave , thoughtful documentary . Ewing and Grady have accomplished something of a miracle with Jesus Camp ... at once explosive and unbiased . Lord knows the film would n't have been as entertaining if they 'd played it straight . Ewing and Grady present this disturbing material in the only manner that it can be offered effectively 	Evangelical indoctrination is given an unflinching , even-handed look in this utterly worthwhile documentary .
north-by-northwest North by Northwest ( 1959 ) is an Alfred Hitchcock classic , suspenseful comic thriller - one of the most entertaining movies ever made and one of his most famous Of course , the hallmark of North by Northwest is the way in which Hitchcock develops tension . Highly entertaining . A thriller so improbable that it becomes quite brilliant in evading even the most fantastic of audience guesses . It is at once a cool romance and a cool comedy , a hot thriller and a hot adventure . Big , glossy , Hitchcock entertainment . North By Northwest is the quintessential Hitchcock thriller and one of the most exciting movies of all time . So there . Rich imagery , with many links to Vertigo . The romcom suspense caper is a cinematic recipe that Alfred Hitchcock took with him to his grave ; certainly I ca n't imagine anyone now succeeding in blending thrills , spills , caresses and laughs the way he did in this sublime classic from 1959 . Hitchcock succeeded in wanting to give popcorn munchers a movie to smile at . And he was never this playful again . 	Gripping , suspenseful , and visually iconic , this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow .
district b13 The sheer ridiculousness of the story is part of the fun of this French import , which was produced by Luc Besson and stars two stuntmen turned ... um ... stuntmen with dialogue . Go for the dazzling , if repetitive , human stunt work . Endure the appallingly simplistic politics . Genre fans will get a kick from the martial-arts action , and that 's all District B13 needs to do . Leito-Damien attempt to refurbish the veracity of the French motto `` Liberty , Equality , Fraternity '' in the same way Morel-Besson try to restore the integrity of the action film . Even the snobbiest cineaste will most likely wipe away the drool after seeing Belle , whose athletic ability suggests Jackie Chan after being bitten by an irradiated spider . District B-13 is a hoot , so assured of its own coolness that it 's hard not to go along . proudly states its vanity and hollow entertainment value District B13 is a fine , snappy little picture that 's one-part Escape From New York , one-part martial-arts flick , and mostly silly fun . Whew ! I ca n't remember the last time I got such an adrenaline rush watching a movie . Both smart and direct , District B13 is the kind of lean , mean action film most of America 's working directors only wish they could pull off . 	A nonstop thrill ride , District B13 's dizzying action sequences more than make up for any expository flaws .
lantana The movie 's thriller hook is really just that : a hook , a pretext on which to hang some remarkably conceived and executed characterizations . I grew to resent the way the storylines began to collide and converge -- it is n't a small world , it 's microscopic . Lawrence cast well and gets terrific performances all the way up and down the line . While the contrivances tend to pile up rather uncomfortably ... the picture is saved ( though barely ) by its remarkable leads . A nicely structured account of mid-life crises undergone by a group of Australians who meet through dramatic circumstances . This well constructed film will keep you guessing until the end This is the sort of fiercely intelligent , emotionally gripping movie about people that almost never gets made any more . Love is indeed the greatest mystery , and it 's a bit unfortunate that the filmmakers were n't content to simply explore that quandary instead of manufacturing another . Remarkably non-bummer viewing . Bleak as its outlook is , it 's not so much psychodrama as psychocomedy of manners . Very effective acting talent , even if you 've never heard of the dozen who do n't enjoy above-the-title billing . 	Lantana is an intricately plotted character study that quietly shines with authenticity .
two days one night Wonderbrothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne return with a tale of heroic struggle against an ordinary disaster . The premise is just impossible to accept.There 's simply no way a company would torpedo itself by allowing this situation and the movie ca n't be taken seriously because of it . The Dardennes have gifted us yet another important and moving film and it would be churlish not to wish them that coveted Palme d'Or . The Dardennes bring enough moral shading to their story to prevent it becoming a tract , and tie it up with an ethical conundrum so dripping with juice , the usherettes should have been handing out bibs . A stunning performance by Cotillard and a moral dilemma aptly presented . There is plenty of intrigue beneath the surface , as the film uses the no-frills style of the Dardennes to sharply probe office politics and socioeconomic strife , refusing to provide easy answers . A genuine horror story , sweaty with a palpable ring of truth about the unending fear that accompanies life on the knife edge of financial despair . It 's a film that captures humanity at its best and its worst , sometimes simultaneously . More sentimental and contrived than previous films from Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne , this is still a topical and touching tale . A lean , no nonsense film crafted in the most brutally honest style of the Dardennes with a stellar performance by Marion Cotillard . 	Another profoundly affecting work from the Dardenne brothers , Two Days , One Night delivers its timely message with honesty and clear-eyed compassion .
brother bear Disney 's latest attempt to hold the line for traditional animation is a formulaic enough effort , but it still comes through with the moralistic goods when it needs to . Skirts self-parody in its rigid adherence to the cartoon-epic template . O.K . for kids , bearable for adults . A sweet celebration of brotherhood in its many forms . Brother Bear does have a satisfying ending and it 's nice to see a G-rated film without bathroom humor , but there is too much formula and not enough reason to pay attention here . Today 's street-smart moviegoing kids do n't need to be so shamelessly pandered to . A really good Disney film tarnished by really bad Phil Collins music . Lackluster story only for kindergarteners . The characters are mechanisms who move along the plot arc from point A to point B . It 's another must-have for Disney fans . 	Brother Bear is gentle and pleasant if unremarkable Disney fare , with so-so animation and generic plotting .
norbit Why is everybody in such a tizzy over Norbit ? Perhaps worried that he might be taken seriously following his knockout performance in Dreamgirls , Eddie Murphy churned out yet another script-deficient comedy along the lines of Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor . ... a strange , toneless collection of fat jokes , fart jokes and foul sex gags . It 's an astonishingly crass and vulgar film , crudely directed on a cut-rate budget by Brian Robbins , never more than almost funny or less than disturbing . Murphy may be at the top of his game , but Norbit is stuck on autopilot . The question is not whether Murphy can do anything . He can . The question is why he would want to make a movie as squirmingly unfunny as Norbit . You would n't call this a recommendation , exactly , but the new Eddie Murphy movie is not nearly as horrible as it looks . Eddie Murphy reaches into his comedic closet and pulls out a hysterical hit . Murphy 's work in Norbit makes his fine performance in Dreamgirls look like he was acting with a couple of hands tied behind his back . Norbit may be the most disturbing , morally repugnant , nightmare-inducing film of the century so far . 	Coming off his Oscar-nominated performance in Dreamgirls , the talented-but-inconsistent Eddie Murphy plays three roles in Norbit , a cruel , crass , stereotype-filled comedy that 's more depressing than funny .
short term 12 2013 We go to the movies for discoveries like this , an authentic masterpiece that stands out because of old-fashioned tenets such as terrific directing and acting . There are so many pitfalls , and it seems like every TV movie version of the story falls into all of them at the same time . But in Short Term 12 , writer-director Destin Cretton manages to skillfully step over all of them . From the get-go , the movie has you , anchoring you down to its sad and beautiful world and demanding that you carry with you all of the incredible thoughts and feelings it has to offer . In lesser hands ... could easily have become a tearjerker , but it neatly sidesteps the trap to remain truthful and affecting . Short Term 12 emerges out of nowhere and blindsides you in a way few movies could ever hope to . A gripping and often compelling character study and a wonderful human drama . This surprising little sleeper will give you more big feelings in its first 15 minutes than every one of last summer 's blockbusters combined . A wonderfully authentic film about the families built from the fragments of broken homes Larson is one to watch . At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it 's going , but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents . 	Short Term 12 is an emphatic , revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths .
the bands visit The formality and the deliberate pace suggest the influence of Laurel and Hardy and Jacques Tati ... Eran Kolirin 's fish-out-of-water comedy-drama is a real treat , often funny and genuinely moving . Tonally , The Band 's Visit steps gingerly on the line between 'sweetly humane ' and 'cloyingly quirky , ' but [ director ] Kolirin pulls back the reins just enough , maintaining control by expressing as much with his framing as with his script . Eran Kolirin 's insightful little film -- about a starched band of cop-musicians whose travel plans go awry -- is more than about what happens when ostensible enemies get to know each other . It 's a small , profoundly satisfying movie that keeps echoing long after it 's over . The laughter , I think , comes from a recognition of the shape of our own regrets . Radiant and wise comedy of miscommunication . A genuinely touching crowd-pleaser and a real treat . One of the film 's prime strengths is its wordless willingness to let the principal characters express themselves through music and mime to overcome cultural barriers . [ DVD ] Sunny and light . Could have been much more if it had wanted to . 	The Band 's Visit is both a clever , subtle slice-of-life comedy , and poignant cross-cultural exploration .
the triplets of belleville does n't have much to offer outside of its technical achievements , which is both amazing and a shame , considering Chomet 's fertile imagination . The astonishing , outlandish , and singular originality of this movie defeats any attempt to describe or explain it . But it also makes it a lot of fun to watch . La historia se cuenta en imgenes y sonidos , y ese es un primer gran mrito a tener en cuenta en una poca en que los personajes del cine suelen hablar demasiado . Perhaps the worst animated feature film I 've ever seen . Triplets is very probably unlike anything you 've seen before . If Walt Disney had gone on a binge of red wine , hallucinatory drugs and absurdist plays , The Triplets of Belleville could have sprouted from his animation empire . This is an animated movie to fall in love with . This is a film that speaks a universal language of funny images and unexpected surprises . Chomet has made a refreshing film set apart by its humour , unique cultural flavour and quality animation . [ An ] effortlessly charming cry of defiance against America , wrapped up in a touching and ticklishly funny , yet bitter-sweet tale that dances across the screen . 	Richly detailed and loaded with surreal touches , The Triplets of Belleville is an odd , delightful charmer .
red road In a triumph of filmmaking , Arnold has endowed a tale of female rage with disquieting social resonance . Kate Dickie turns in an intense , layered performance as Jackie . Considering the fact that she barely speaks a word in the course of the film , it 's especially impressive . It 's a fully realized portrait of a city , Glasgow , a portrait of a smart , watchful woman who works as a security monitor and who has endured great loss ; and a portrait of the act and psychological implications of surveillance . A Lynne Ramsay-esque Scottish handwringer in that it could possibly make you want to come home and take your own life . That was a compliment , in case you were n't sure . That devilish idea machine Lars von Trier reached into his bag of tricks and came up with the Advance Party project . A strong story -- involving and moving and probably a little too long . Red Road is an atmospheric little thriller made up of equal parts paranoia , loneliness and anxiety . Red Road does not make easy viewing , yet emerges as compulsively watchable . The measure of Red Road is that it leaves us hungry for what comes next . Red Road is a portrait of a voyeur , and it invites us to become voyeurs of the voyeur . 	Red Road director Andrea Arnold skillfully parses out just enough plot details at a time to keep the audience engrossed in this seductive thriller .
1129132-torque I was heartily entertained , for all the wrong reasons . A towering bore . Make no mistake , Torque is -- by any rational standards -- a bad movie . But it 's a fun bad movie . This is a movie so stupid , I 'm surprised Paul Walker is n't in it . There is so much testosterone in this film that any woman who watches it will come out of it with a hairy chest and a favorite football team . Torque is like a third generation copy of a bad videotape . A strong candidate for the most thunderingly stupid movie of the year . A movie made by people who seem to have chuckled up their sleeves as they shot the picture and expect to laugh all the way to the bank afterwards . Torque is like a grease stain on your favorite shirt - dirty , maddening and unnecessary . A non-stop assault on the senses . 	Silly and noisy , Torque is stylish fun for the MTV crowd .
juno If Juno were cheese and macaroni , it would be among the most satisfying mac-and-cheese dishes ever conceived . It 's great to see a family on film that does n't freak out at this all-too-common scenario . As alienated as Juno may feel , she 's actually surrounded by some pretty great people in her life . Reitman deftly creates a modern romantic comedy out of a serious situation that applauds the value of life , with terrific performances by all , especially Page and Simmons . A sharp-edged , sweet-centred , warm-hearted coming-of-age movie that 's always just that little bit smarter than you think it is . Together , Cody and Page have crafted a highly memorable character . Yes , I 'll say it : this film is overrated . Page reigns over the movie , joined by a solid , eclectic cast who are allowed to be as individualized as she is . Much of the dialogue sparkles with wit and humanity . Young Juno is self-possessed and breathlessly selfaware , the sort of person who is comfortable in any situation simply because she is comfortable in her own skin Gilmore Girls gone wild ... [ Blu-Ray review ] 	One of the brightest , funniest comedies of the year , Juno 's smart script and direction are matched by assured performances in a coming of age story with a 21st century twist .
clash of the titans Fine , vintage Harryhousen , but it 's too old for when it came out . Offers an opportunity to see Shakesperean actors ( Olivier , Maggie Smith ) playing mythic roles in a frivolous , campy way . Gloriously goofy fun Os efeitos criados pelo lendrio Harryhausen podem parecer frgeis diante dos avanos atuais , mas so perfeitos para esta obra que permanece descompromissadamente divertida . Clash of the Titans will still hold a place in the heart of anyone who 's old enough to have seen it in the theaters . Yes , I 'm that old . visually striking Teenage boys will love it , but the rest of us will be frustrated by the storytelling , the shaky camerawork and the dubiously effective 3D presentation , which distracts more than it offers ... a camp-infused fantasy flick that will probably work best among younger viewers and those with fond memories of its original theatrical release . Dull adventure about Greek gods , despite Ray Harryhausen effects Silly togas and hammy performances still ca n't derail this fitting swan song for effects legend Ray Harryhausen ; the sequence in the Medusa 's lair is his finest moment . 	A goofy , old-school sword-and-sandal epic , Clash of the Titans mines Greek mythology for its story and fleshes it out with Ray Harryhausen 's charmingly archaic stop-motion animation techniques .
lonely hearts Concentrating as much on the detectives investigating the case as on the killers , Lonely Hearts fails to show off its impressive cast at their best . Strongly focused when it comes to atmosphere . But it strains too hard to contain its disparate plot elements . Un buen ejemplo de cine negro , gnero fuera de moda que an conserva su encanto . One more dip into the tin-eared neo-noir well . Because Robinson ca n't seem to settle on a distinct tone , Lonely Hearts dances perilously on the edge of self-parody . A beautifully photographed remake of 1970 cult B-movie The Honeymoon Killers succeeds better than many in balancing the philosophical with the visceral , although its villains ' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy . The picture belongs to Salma Hayek . Hayek 's alluring temptress persona reinvents Beck 's obese nag as a sexed up femme fatale , in an exceedingly odd way trumping Leto 's wimpy , henpecked unconvincing womanizer . Vastly miscast ( particularly Salma Hayek ) and dramatically uninvolving , this third version of the 1940s real-life murderous couple is inferior to both Leonard Kastle 's 1970 cult film Honeymoon Killers and Arturo Ripstein 's 1996 Mexican adaptation . Lonely Hearts ca n't help but trip on its Hollywood aesthetic standards . 	Several genres and plotlines intertwine in Lonely Hearts but do n't connect , creating an uneven and unsatisfying film .
gladiator Gladiator pours on the usual Caesar dressing . Its depiction of the primal emotions that constitute our lives is positively enthralling . Is this thrilling to anyone ? If no one paid attention to Russell Crowe after his stellar performances in `` The Insider '' and `` L.A . Confidential , '' they did so after he put on his Roman togs . Vibrant , visceral , provocative and transporting . Action-packed and passionate . Without Russell Crowe 's dynamism holding it all together , Gladiator might have devolved into a rash of overblown pandering . There 's nary a dull moment in the film . Scott ... has delivered the first Roman Empire epic in more than 30 years and it 's a doozy . A movie that revels in the primal thrill of swords tearing into flesh and blood spraying in huge , arterial gouts . 	Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath .
1153077-1153077-pride and prejudice One of the most delightful and heartwarming adaptations made from Austen or anybody else . Quite literally , a delightful surprise . So why , in no less than five miniseries and two official film adaptations of Pride and Prejudice , have we yet to encounter a satisfying screen Lizzie ? The new Pride & Prejudice is faithful to the manners of 200 years ago , but it moves with speed and vigor , so the emotions feel as raw and modern as your last crying jag . It 's a thoroughly enjoyable love story that 's given a fresh new look ... a movie to just lose yourself in . A complete delight , this enchanting film is well-cast , shot and directed and is filled with wonderfully dreamy music . Knightley brings Austen 's book to glorious , pulsating life . Director Joe Wright also coordinates a delightfully cohesive acting ensemble . ... the classic chick flick story long before any flick found the word chick . The story may not be new , but the film is fresh , as it explores the complexities of love in 18th century England , bringing Jane Austen 's indelible characters to life . 	Sure , it 's another adaptation of cinema 's fave Jane Austen novel , but key performances and a modern filmmaking sensibility make this familiar period piece fresh and enjoyable .
the missing picture Panh honors the Khmer Rouge 's victims while staging the agony and responsibility of memory itself . Rithy Panh turns a potential gimmick into a profound , inspiring film . Then , in expanding his scope to the propaganda machine of that regime , he reaches straight into the heart of evil and finds cinema . Obviously based on Panh 's autobiography , this is a reminder of obliteration and how cinema can claim memory , history . The film is a brave act of witness complicated by the documaker 's decision to re-create his experiences using clay figurines , a tricky aesthetic device that raises fascinating and problematic questions of representation . Both great cinema and important journalism , a rare and privileged combination . The audacity of `` The Missing Picture '' - a brilliant documentary about a child who held on to life in Cambodia 's killing fields - is equaled only by its soulfulness . A histria antiga : mudam os opressores ; os oprimidos , porm , so sempre os mesmos . As an examination of memory and experience and how they shape us , `` The Missing Picture '' is meaningful beyond its specific subject matter . With sober eloquence , the filmmaker lays out the arrival of the Khmer Rouge , the philosophy used to justify their crimes , and the slow slipping away of his family , each member claimed by this horrible social experiment . These battered , scratched pieces of film are eloquent testimony for the terrible offences that happened . 	Thrillingly unorthodox and emotionally searing without being didactic , The Missing Picture is a uniquely poignant documentary -- and so much more .
1016819-producers The film is ripe with treasures worth rediscovering . This is one of the funniest movies ever made . Mel Brooks has turned a funny idea into a slapstick film , thanks to the performers , particularly Zero Mostel . This shamelessly low-brow , fearlessly satirical Brooks movie may just be Hollywood 's ultimate satire , a furiously witty 'reductio ad absurdum ' worthy of the great Augustans like Pope and Swift . I agree that it was funny . I did not find it one of the funniest of all time . An anarchic reminder that laughter can be mightier than the sword . Quite possibly Brooks 's finest hour . Everything that can go wrong in an amateur film does go wrong , from the timing to the structure to the pitch of the performances . Like The Producers itself , Springtime for Hitler , with its Busby Berkeley-meets-Leni Riefenstahl choreography and creatively crude lyrics , ends up proving that bad taste can be irresistible . A cheeky and intelligent look at a more disturbing side of live theatre . 	A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood , The Producers is one of Mel Brooks ' finest , as well as funniest films , featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel .
love actually The movie 's only flaw is also a virtue : It 's jammed with characters , stories , warmth and laughs , until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and does n't want to leave anything out . Love , Actually '' is a bit sluggish at times , the film 's good nature and wit grows on you . The year 's busiest and most relentlessly shameless comedy . It 's also among the year 's funniest and most disarming . A charming little film that , unfortunately , gets carried away with itself and never quite makes the grade . There are no fewer than nine interlocking and overlapping love stories in Richard Curtis ' deadly epic sprawl of a romantic comedy , Love Actually . By the end of the movie , that 's nine too many . Disconcertingly lubricious . Curtis throws every gag he can think of at the screen and the ones that do n't stick , he throws again and again . This shouldnt work , its so obvious and unconvincing and overdone , yet I have to admit that the damn movie got to me . Yet another pandering , half-baked romantic comedy . Peppered with so many moments of raw , affecting honesty that it 's intensely difficult to dislike -- and tempting to forgive Richard Curtis for not finishing what he starts , 	A sugary tale overstuffed with too many stories . Still , the cast charms .
kate and leopold `` Life is not comprised solely of tasks , but tastes . '' Jackman commands Kate and Leopold as no actor has commanded a romantic comedy since Steve Martin in Roxanne . Kate & Leopold is is as gracious and charming as its hero , Leopold ( Hugh Jackman ) , the third Duke of Albany . Together , Jackman and Ryan really click . Essentially a Nora Ephron fairy tale with a sci-fi twist and a lot more plot than you might find in one of Ms. Ephron 's cotton-candy daydreams . If I see one more movie with Meg Ryan as a disillusioned career woman who just does n't believe in love anymore -- I 'll blow chunks ! Supremely and sublimely romantic . Hilarious at times , unbearably soppy at others , Kate & Leopold is comfortable viewing for old romantics . It 's rare to come across a time travel tale as listless as this one . Suffers from a complete lack of conviction in its material . 	Though Jackman charms , Kate and Leopold is bland and predictable , and the time travel scenario lacks inner logic .
unknown white male John Wayne wore cowboy drag , Mel Gibson 's mullet was his tip-off , but the most recognizable action hero signature these days is Liam Neeson 's nose . The movie is a well-performed , well-directed thriller that kept me interested the entire time . A nifty final twist , but it is so joyless and heavy-handed I found it impossible to like . If conspiracy movies of any sort are your thing , then consider Unknown a familiar , yet solid , entry in the canon . For those who want some innovation to go with their thrills , then move along . This twist-filled tale of an amnesiac falling into a web of international intrigue moves swiftly but makes little sense -- and has ludicrous moments . The snow and haze that Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra keeps pumping into the street scenes seem to have drifted into the script as well . An increasingly improbable and easily watchable action thriller with Liam Neeson grimacing his way through memory loss and the murky secrets of bio-tech espionage . If this all sounds rather like dj vu , then consider yourself one step ahead of the game . An unmemorable Euro-thriller that frustrates more than it thrills , squandering an attractive cast and inventive premise . If Liam Neeson is now typecast as an aging action hero , he would be better off finding better scripts . 	Liam Neeson elevates the proceedings considerably , but Unknown is ultimately too derivative -- and implausible -- to take advantage of its intriguing premise .
the diary of a teenage girl Way overrated when it played Sundance , if this disappointing and dreary film presents one of the most unappealing ensembles of characters I have seen in a long time . A coming-of-age movie from a woman 's perspective that deals with sex in a frank , graphic way that is never salacious or prurient . Powley is a 25-year-old actress , but she 's a convincing teen in every sense ( which will lead to the discomfort of some ) . It 's a breakout performance . Sometimes a performance is so good it leads people to think a movie is better than it is . Adapting Phoebe Gloeckner 's illustrated novel , Heller makes an impressive big-screen debut with this seriocomic adventure through the life and head of Minnie Goetze ( played by British actress Bel Powley ) . A movie of ( increasingly rare ) truly indie sensibility , made by women who are confident about healthy feminine resilience . Bold but flawed film about sexual awakening is very mature . Frank , poignant and daring , `` The Diary of a Teenage Girl '' invites you into the mind-set of a sexually adventurous 16-year-old girl - and suggests you leave your judgment at the door . [ Minnie ] learns ; she learns better , and she learns well , but the movie is about becoming , not being judged , and not about judging oneself . Like all tightrope walks , The Diary Of A Teenage Girl is fearless , and often breathtaking . Credit Heller for keeping proceedings in perspective and for delivering one of the most candid accounts of the teen odyssey . 	Boldly unconventional and refreshingly honest , Diary of a Teenage Girl is a frank coming-of-age story that addresses its themes -- and its protagonist -- without judgment .
gridiron gang The film has nowhere near as many well-developed characters as it has street , prison yard and on-field brawls . ... utterly predictable ... ... the movie 's good intentions are consistently undermined by its simplistic notion of redemption , and its inspirational thrust is diluted by an epilogue that suggests the program still has a ways to go in the life-altering department . Johnson gives the part his authoritative all , but he does n't have the depth of ability to elevate a sappy script that regularly calls for up-choking . Though one of the producing entities is called Original Film , nothing could be further from the truth ... hopelessly formulaic and pat . [ Screenwriter Jeff Maguire ] reduces practically every scene to an oversimplified emoticon . Mostly the movie barrels toward you , stiff-armed . Bad News Bangers ... a lugubrious tutorial on the importance of being a winner . ... as Robert Aldrich proved in The Longest Yard , a football movie should be able to hit harder . 	The role of probation officer Sean Porter fits Dwayne `` The Rock '' Johnson like a glove ; however , the execution is so cliched , the youths ' stories ( based on real events ) , fail to inspire .
sound city Grohl has ... created both a fascinating account of the process of analogue recording and a tender tribute to the rock bands of yesteryear . Sound City is a fun ride for diehard fans of most any brand of rock and roll . In Sound City , a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary , dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again . Grohl 's aim is to explore the aura of a place , but what he winds up proving is that people make the magic . It cheapens itself by hitting some self-congratulatory notes , but until it does it covers some fascinating rock 'n ' roll ground . A sincere tribute to the tape-based dumpy Sound City . For those about to rock , we salute you . A fond acknowledgement of a special time when a studio produced several albums that signaled key moments in music history . An infectious appreciation for rock and roll lingers past the somewhat self-satisfied finale . An electrifying and enthralling labor of love that acts as a defibrillator for your creative juices . Dave Grohl 's terrific new doc , Sound City , profiles the studio where some of the greatest music of the past four decades was born . 	Smart , affectionate , and unabashedly sincere , Sound City pairs a great soundtrack with a well-argued ode to one of rock 'n ' roll 's most fondly remembered bygone eras .
1093611-anna and the king A great family movie ! Holds its own against the beloved 1956 musical The King and I . A live-action family film with brains . Foster , I believe , sees right through this material and out the other side , and does n't believe in a bit of it . A simple , no-frills story . A smart and splendidly decorated rethinking of Anna Leonowens 's famous chronicle of her years as tutor to the royal family of Siam . This may be the best and healthiest date movie of the season . the sort of film that would have contended for a Best Picture Oscar in the mid-80s and handily won in the early 60s The third major screen version of the story , has much to recommend it . Serve as a slap in the face . 	Beautiful cinematography ca n't prevent Anna and the King from being boring and overly lengthy .
taking woodstock Woodstock participants wallowed in Yasgar 's muddy fields . [ Director Ang ] Lee wallows in Teichberg 's muddy % u2014 and uninteresting % u2014 experience . Really , it 's the same circumstance captured in Bye Bye Birdie , but Lee and Schamus lack a sense of humor . Too bad the principal character lacks the charisma to carry the movie . Do n't expect too much from Taking Woodstock and you might just enjoy its kind-hearted , sunny spirit . It is not , however , an experience that will linger long . The film 's focus on one man 's story instead of the event itself is a solid narrative choice ; the execution , however , is uneven and disappointing . Lee and producer-screenwriter James Schamus aim for comedy but come up with cliches . It 's harmless enough as a snapshot of a young man 's awakening to the grand possibilities of adult life , but not particularly effective at capturing the spirit , the thrill or even the mud of this culturally monumental event . One man 's near-emotionless trip through an event that was the high watermark for US counterculture moves along without any real sense of purpose or pace . Taking Woodstock has the freshness of something being created , not remembered . Parental Content Review 	Featuring numerous 60s-era clichs , but little of the musical magic that highlighted the famous festival , Taking Woodstock is a breezy but underwhelming portrayal .
1045250-hocus pocus With Bette Midler and her onscreen sisters shamelessly hamming things up , it looks as if those involved in making this inoffensive flight of fantasy had more fun than anyone over 12 will have watching it . This is one of the oddest releases of the summer , and it 's hard to imagine it finding a broad audience . With the rather ghoulish deaths of children depicted , it 's certainly too strong for very young moviegoers . As a family film , Hocus Pocus is passable -- - provided you do n't have particularly high standards . It strictly remains more `` trick '' than `` treat . '' Watching the movie is like attending a party you were n't invited to , and where you do n't know anybody , and they 're all in on a joke but wo n't explain it to you . Terrible family movie with bad music and lame overacting . Dreadful . Perhaps I underestimate the power of its generational hold , yet considering the potential of a broad Disney witch romp , Hocus Pocus is an incredibly mediocre movie . It 's acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting . Unless they 're Bette Midler fans . In which case it 's depressing as hell . The best that can be said about the acting by the witches is that it is , well , bizarre . And rarely funny . 	Harmlessly hokey yet never much more than mediocre , Hocus Pocus is a muddled family-friendly effort that fails to live up to the talents of its impressive cast .
pi Eureka ! This movie is the ultimate portrayal of the numbers racket -- a slice of pi that as sci-fi fantasy really does cut it and makes us hunger fort desserts in store as a sequel to this promising debut by Mr. Aronofsky . Pi is an interesting film . Not a particularly good one , but interesting nonetheless . Shot in blotchy , grimy black-and-white and edited in a style almost reminiscent of the French New Wave , 'Pi ' is as jarring to the eye as it is enticing to the mind . What is difficult is to view this film without a mind seeking to be intrigued , because , if you do n't want intrigue , you should n't be watching Pi . An ambitious , stylish and intriguing first effort by Aronofsky and director of photography Matthew Libatique . If you 're of a mind for an offbeat but fascinating film , give it a shot . Who knew mathematics and numerology could be so engrossing ? a real treat Every line of dialogue , indeed every small action , is packed with meaning in this taxingly potent film . The intent is to create a living nightmare of psychological horror , and Aronofsky succeeds most unsettlingly . Pi accomplishes so much more with ... its micro-budget than a Hollywood production could . 	Dramatically gripping and frighteningly smart , this Lynchian thriller does wonders with its unlikely subject and shoestring budget .
scary movie 2 It 's the wackiness of the whole thing that makes it work . Filme producto de la excesiva comercializacin que tuvo su predecesor Dumb humor , insults and gallons of bodily fluids . If you have n't seen the target film , not only is it not funny , it becomes totally pointless . Scarily awful -- this spoof horror franchise needs a stake driven through its heart , and quick ... Perhaps if you send them a stamped , self-addressed envelope they 'll tell us why this was thought to be funny . the opening 15 minutes was absolutely gut-wretchingly hysterical . I laughed more at this second film than I did at the first one ... It 's just terrible , with long stretches in which the sea of writers do n't even try to insert any humour , followed by an attempted joke that does n't work on any level . We can only hope this excrement masquerading as humor will bury the gross-out genre once and for all . More of the same ... only less funny . 	Instead of being funny , this gross-out sequel plays like a sloppy , rushed-out product .
audition 1999 By the end I found myself feeling so creeped out it was Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer all over again . Whether reading Audition as a portrait of coming to terms with grief , a feminist revenge tale , or a graphic exploration of romantic attachment and idealism , it remains a terrifying film . A total freakout that will slow-burn itself into your brain . Prepare to feel creepy . The shock imperative takes on a life of its own and floats away from the lengthy setup . Will get under your skin and stay there for many days . This film is skillfully made , expertly directed , well acted , and pretty distasteful to me . Becomes hung up somewhere between polemic rant and bloodletting so luridly graphic as to overshadow whatever sense of righteous revenge the filmmakers were aiming for . Miike , the Tasmanian Devil of modern filmmakers , throws our assumptions back at us like a thousand poison darts . Great film . A diabolically adroit piece of filmmaking that goes even further than the films of Italy 's excruciatingly macabre Dario Argento . One of the most shocking Japanese horror films ever 	An audacious , unsettling Japanese horror film from director Takashi Miike , Audition entertains as both a grisly shocker and a psychological drama .
morvern callar Well intentioned but ultimately too aloof and pretentious for its own good . Ramsay makes good on the promise of her debut feature , Ratcatcher . Few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . An intriguing premise and bizarre opening show potential , but the film chooses the least interesting direction possible when it veers off on its road trip . Ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory . As Morvern , [ Morton is ] disconcertingly enigmatic , often bordering on catatonic . But she carries the movie effortlessly . turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters Samantha Morton plays Morvern with the impressive lack of self-consciousness that has become her trademark . Appealing ? Not exactly . But Morvern Callar ... is a strange and evocative work that 's not easy to dismiss . Morton finds a wealth of nuance in anomie and neurasthenia . 	Morton quietly makes this quirky , enigmatic mood piece a compelling watch .
pariah 2011 The gifted Dee Rees makes finding out a stirring and heartfelt journey . And Adepero Oduye is unforgettable . A star is born . ... evades the formula for coming-of-age films as it announces the arrival of a fascinating new star in the remarkable Adepero Oduye . Respectable work , with earnest intentions and a vivid depiction of a corner of American culture . Rees has crafted a moving and powerful first effort that is a welcome edition to the lesbian film canon . Street-wise and sincere , it 's destined to reassure troubled teens searching for their identity - and their parents . First-time feature filmmaker Dee Rees has crafted a movie that is consistently riveting because it is steeped in truth . She and her cast never once strike a false note . This is a look at the joy , confusion and heartbreak of adolescence that 's both culture- and locale-specific and , at the same time , universal . Pariah plays like a longer , more complex addendum to the recent It Gets Better campaign aimed at sending messages of survival and strength to gay and lesbian teens ... Ultimately , Pariah chronicles pain and beauty in the birth of an artist . The film 's only real pariahs are those who reject her . The gay coming-of-age story 's been done , but `` Pariah '' has something fresh to say , largely about the knotty complexities of love , and how they might keep someone in the closet : How badly do you need to be free , to hurt the people you love ? 	Pulsing with authenticity and led by a stirring lead performance from Adepero Oduye , Pariah is a powerful coming out/coming-of-age film that signals the arrival of a fresh new talent in writer/director Dee Rees .
shrek A fresh twist on the fairytale humor genre . A real highlight of the year , certainly the one to beat this summer . A a computer-animated burlesque fairy tale that generates more belly laughs than any live-action comedy since Best in Show . Forget Pinocchio or Snow White : children will want their parents to read them the adventures of Shrek when it 's time to pick a bedtime story . Shrek 's self-reflexive silliness is in nearly perfect counterpoint to its giddy spirit of adventure , friendship , and romance . The sarcastic , nasty tone of smug hipness clashes mightily with the film 's shrill attempts at sincerity and lesson-learning . The rendering of the displaced fairy-tale gang is wonderfully done . Truly what a family film was meant to be -- a vehicle that has something for everyone . A very good and weird animated comedy adventure ... Gag by gag -- and there 's a stream -- it 's merrily irreverent , visually and vocally . The bigger picture , though , is rather more conventional . 	While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales , the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney 's nose , provide a moral message to children , and offer viewers a funny , fast-paced ride .
1014217-moonraker The space-age plot is spread dangerously thin , the fights all tend to slapstick , and the wanton destruction has become rather too predictable . But it 's held together by likeable performances . Moonraker , the newest James Bond spectacle , is a cheerful , splashy entertainment . The curators of the Bond museum do not surpass themselves with this exhibition , the 11th in the series , but they have n't fallen down on the job either . James Bond would have to go back to Earth in `` For Your Eyes Only '' because `` Moonraker '' is truly a stuck-up , half-witted , scruffy-looking nerf herder . A classic Bond movie ; girls , action and style Ludicrous but enjoyable hooey . All that remains of the mood of the early films is the theme tune . And though Albert R. Broccoli , the producer , says that Bond goes on forever and never ages . the fact is that he is getting more juvenile with every film that 's made . Typical Bond stuff . You know you love it . Possibly the worst Bond film . The series ' spectacular photography , gimmickry , verve and wry wit are still abundant . 	Featuring one of the series ' more ludicrous plots but outfitted with primo gadgets and spectacular sets , Moonraker is both silly and entertaining .
september dawn Often gripping and fascinating , it 's bound to create waves of controversy . The maudlin , grotesque western September Dawn apes Schindler 's List in hopes of creatinga Christian Holocaust picture . What could have been a galvanizing and all-too timely account of religious fanaticism turning violent has instead been reduced to the banal level of an Romeo and Juliet-type love story . Cain has co-written and directed a film that only the most bigoted of Mormom detractors could enjoy . Most viewers , if any are willing to part with their money or time , will simply laugh derisively . Muddled , sloppy , and obfuscating . The villainous turns by Jon Voight ( as a hard-hearted Mormon bishop ) and Terence Stamp ( as a bloodthirsty Brigham Young ) would have been more fun if they were n't part of such a clumsy campaign to lay this tragedy at the church 's doorstep . This handsome indie Western damningly recounts the 1857 slayings of 120 settlers passing through Utah , but the didactic presentation , grim speechifying and tacked-on love story all signify a less-than-healthy regard for the audience 's intelligence . Even if Cain and co-screenwriter Carole Whang Schutter hold no animosity toward the LDS , the flat-footed fakiness of their story prevents September Dawn from feeling historically accurate . With September Dawn , filmmaker Christopher Cain has turned a national tragedy into a teen romance , and not in a grand , entertaining , Titanic way . It turns a complicated story of religious bigotry and paranoia , with visitations from God , self-appointed prophets and 'divine ' instruction into a dry history lesson . 	With its jarring editing , dull love story , and silly dialogue , September Dawn turns a horrific historical event into a banal movie .
capitalism a love story Moore 's scattershot is a lot more interesting than some filmmakers ' focus , and many of those individual parts are classic . Michael Moore 's Capitalism : A Love Story is something else -- not a good movie or a coherent exposition of the meltdown but an emotional attack on capitalism as a system , an attempt , literally , to de-moralize capitalism . an utterly frustrating work that contains a few genuinely affecting moments that wind up getting lost amidst too much tired and fairly patronizing junk . Moore apparently ca n't make his mind which of two competing visions of America is the right one The film works best when Moore sits with representatives of the 99 percent of Americans vulnerable to financial freefall . Even if it 's not the most cogent political docu-essay ever made , it 's surely coming straight from the heart . By returning to his roots , professional gadfly Michael Moore turns in one of his best films . Is n't it Washington that took money from the taxpayers to bail out the banks ? Should n't Moore run his yellow crime-scene tape around the White House ? [ It ] may be a bit scattershot and employ familiar tricks , [ but it 's both ] a challenging and personal movie . The biggest strike ... with this film is its hypocrisy . Here 's a man taking shots at capitalism , and he 's the biggest capitalist in Hollywood . 	Love him or hate him , Capitalism captures Michael Moore in his muckraking element -- with all the Moore-centric showmanship that entails .
argo 2012 An enthralling and deliciously entertaining movie -- and a deserved triumph for its star and director . Every step of the way is thrilling and heart-pounding . A gutsy blend of suspense and off-the-wall humor , `` Argo '' will immediately grab you from the rush of its prologue and not let go until the end credits roll . This pulse-racing thriller , set in the aftermath of Iran 's Islamic Revolution , grabs you by the throat . The real Argo that 's landing in cinemas now should n't be mistaken as anything other than a spellbinding , old-fashioned thriller . I 've got sweaty palms and an elevated pulse to prove that it 's one of the year 's very best films . If there 's one lesson to be gleaned from director Ben Affleck 's relentlessly tense , painstakingly detailed Argo , it 's that we should consider the possibility that our history has been manipulated more than many of us would care to admit . The old saw `` truth is stranger than fiction '' has had its teeth properly sharpened in the superb thriller Argo , a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular . The cast helps to keep things moving -- particularly the hilarious interplay between Arkin and Goodman . And is it me , or should Bryan Cranston be in every film released ? ... a deeply myopic view of the world , one focused through a distinctly - and distorted - American lens . Its politics are subtle , its performances are good , and its script is amazing . 	Tense , exciting , and often darkly comic , Argo recreates a historical event with vivid attention to detail and finely wrought characters .
1200661-informant ... a strange , strong , tragically funny comedy about all the lies we tell ourselves and others to make it through the wicked world and the working week . The jaundiced color scheme -- evocative of the corn starch that is the company 's prime product -- and Damon 's increasingly disturbing calmness and seemingly irrelevant narration suggest this is a movie about societal as well as personal sickness . Damon transforms better than many of his A-list peers , and his Mark makeover is the reason to see The Informant ! Whitacre 's pathology , skewed perceptions , and cracked commentary provide a welcome alternative , imposing a playful , almost Dadaist narrative onto the sordid realities . The Informant ! leaves the viewer guessing - but thoroughly entertained . Damon showcases a career-best performance in a film that 's funny in a non-laugh-out-loud sort of way . Although Damon is on brilliantly bumbling form , The Informant ! ultimately comes off as Soderbergh 's Burn After Reading - a diversionary lark until he gets back to serious filmmaking . Soderbergh is a good listener , too , always alert to the myriad ways his characters reveal , conceal and finally betray themselves in thought , word and deed . This is Soderbergh having fun with his craft again - and inviting us to join in the laughs . The Informant ! is an entertaining expose of corporate corruption as well as a droll sendup of business-intrigue movies . Matt Damon gives it all he 's got but the movie still is n't the entertainment event you wish it could be . 	A charismatic turn by star Matt Damon and a consistently ironic tone boost this quietly funny satire about a corporate whistle-blower .
instinct de mort Quite engrossing , very much like a cross between Spielberg 's Catch Me If You Can and a French 'Godfather ' Performs the unlikely trick of being both taut and plotless . Except for the brilliant performance of Vincent Cassel , this is deeply flawed movie . Like Refn 's `` Bronson '' , it assumes that the audience will be satisfied by unending brutality -- a false assumption . But Cassel is brilliant as a creep . Richet 's film is an engaging one , even if it often plays like a re-enacted , high-episodic documentary . As suave and stylish as its subject , the film is a tour de force of craft and performance , a portrait that captures the spirit of Mesrine in every frame . The film PUBLIC ENEMIES should have been . An incredible gangster tale full of ball-to-the-wall action ! Instantly gripping , with a powerhouse star performance , it 'll make you want to speed through the weeks to get to part two . It captures the rush of crime as a way of life for a man who did and took whatever he wanted , whenever he wanted , simply because he could take it . Vincent Cassel renders a towering performance as the legendary killer and media darling in the French crime gangster film , an epic of ambitious proportions . No small problem , too , is that the film yields only a rudimentary sense of what it was like to live in France or Canada in the '60s and '70s if you were n't a gangster in a movie . 	It 's undeniably uneven , but Vincent Cassel 's electrifying performance makes Mesrine : Killer Instinct a gangster biopic worth seeking out .
ramona and beezus Joey King will bounce back . There are more laughs in the average episode of Gomez 's Wizards of Waverly Place TV show than in this . This is an almost quaint throwback of a kids ' movie that ends up enjoyably ragtag and cluttered , all of it contained by an emphasis on neighbourhood and maturity . Realistic , refreshing , and reassuring . This movie understands how to get into the head of a little kid . Plus , there 's a little romance for the parents as well . Despite everyone 's efforts , Ramona comes across as an insufferably spoilt and attention-seeking little horror . All of these moments are presented completely without cynicism or judgment , and their joyousness is infectious . A pleasant 1950 's old-fashioned family drama that 's gentle and adorable . There are so many diversions and subplots , it 's hard to get caught up in any single story . The overall effort is pleasant enough to sit through . Yet , with some pairing down of story elements in favor of increasing Ramona 's childhood imagination , the film might have become something of a cinematic classic . ( Parental Review also Available ) Only a twisted , seriously sad individual could have a problem with this sunny tween comedy , which I hated . 	If Ramona and Beezus fails to capture the essence of its classic source material , it 's sunny , sweet , and wholesome .
in the mood for love 2001 Extraordinarily sexy . An elegantly stylized exercise in the geography of melancholy . A fine , but muted showcase for the talents of its two prolific stars . Heat and passion simmer underneath virtually every shot of In the Mood For Love , which dwells on the meaning imparted by the motions of Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung . The film is gorgeous , dripping with texture and sensuality and , well , mood . Just like most vertebrates in any world where gravity exists , however , a lack of a cinematic spine and skeletal structure usually results in a quivering mass that may look interesting , but clearly ca n't get anywhere on its own . A beautifully-tailored , low key ( but always dramatic ) story . In one sense it 's like an erotic dream that dissolves before fulfillment ; in another sense In the Mood suggests that the lovers are remembering the fragmented incidents of this tale from the distance of time . Scene after scene , Wong repeats images , situations , and dialogue , so hung up on representing paralysis that the situation fails to blossom . Shot by shot , it 's a stunningly beautiful work , with a range of electric colors provided by the great cinematographer Christopher Doyle . 	This understated romance , featuring good performances by its leads , is both visually beautiful and emotionally moving .
st trinians that 'jolly hockey sticks ' vibe feels outmoded with the only efforts to update the concept being shorter skirts and push-up bras . Bad in ways that are almost endearing ... When you look at it again , the old film was not only superior but rather more radical . This St Trinian 's looks as if it is aiming at the lowest common denominator , and finding it too often . Everett 's Camilla Fritton , sporting a blonde wig reminiscent of another Camilla , spits out lines through prominent teeth and indulges in 'me time ' at the easel , brush in hand % u2026 There are some good ideas and a few laughs , but it 's all a bit Camilla-on A stunningly witless revival of the infamous British film series about a girls ' boarding school . Innocence is entirely absent from this extremely dubious addition to the big-screen adventures of Ronald Searle 's cartoon creations . Sadly , the movie is a zoo . indifferent to storytelling , craft and , dare I mention , fresh ideas Rupert Everett also expertly mangles the plum role once inhabited by Alastair Sim . Heavy-handed at times and poorly plotted , but energetic and funny . A suitably undignified return to the screen for the notorious school and its out-of-control pupils . 	Both naughtier and campier than Ronald Searle 's original post war series , this St. Trinian 's leans on high jinks instead of performances or witty dialogue .
secret ballot In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . A comedy that provides serious testament to the arduous , often dreary , always imperfect work of democracy . Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . It 's a strong testament to the power of the individual to make a difference , not necessarily through the popular vote , but through the simple act of communication . Clever but slow . Will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . A playful Iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . Offers both a gentle humor and a sly but unmistakable optimism about what life in Iran might one day be . If you 're willing to surrender to its languid , indirect style and its offbeat comic sense , you may find it a rich and rewarding little film . If you do n't have a measure of patience , you will be longing for rescue from this isle long before the credits roll . 	A moderately funny comedy that will reward patient viewers .
poetry 2010 Has a strong flavor of daytime-drama soap . Lee is a gifted , thoughtful filmmaker , unafraid to tackle difficult subjects . `` Poetry , '' which rightfully won the best-screenplay prize at Cannes , never resorts to exploitation . Under Lee 's guidence , it is a mature film for mature audiences . This is a small film . It is also a great one . `` Great '' is a word I do n't use often . As Mija searches for poetic inspiration , `` Poetry '' filmgoers will revel in it . Yoon 's performance , nuanced and subtle , is superb , while the film is long and languid so adjustments and allowances must be made both for its pace and , at times , for its poetry . But the effort is well worth it . Poetry possesses a lyrical delicateness that marks it as something special , different and thought-provoking . True to the title , writer-director Lee Chang-dong is principally concerned with rendering emotions that seem inexpressible . A beautifully acted , deeply moving tale that brings a lump to the throat . Poetry is n't quite in the class of Kurosawa 's Stray Dog , but Lee 's domestic-social drama certainly evinces some of Kurosawa 's ... well , poetry . 	Poetry is an absorbing , poignant drama because it offers no easy answers to its complex central conflict .
queen Mirren delivers a brilliant performance , one that jibes effortlessly with the public figure we ( TM ) ve been watching for more than 50 years while plumbing depths we ( TM ) ve never been privy to . Why is a British film as good as The Queen such a depressing rarity ? This is , after all , a period movie that leaves you with a feeling of sadness at how little has changed . The Queen is the most reverent irreverent comedy imaginable . Or maybe it 's the most irreverent reverent comedy . Either way , it 's a small masterpiece . To give the narrative depth , bite , or oomph , as naturalism , irony , or romance , or some combination ... Morgan would have to have invented more ( as Shakespeare and Schiller did with their historical royalty ) ... . Helen Mirren is flat out phenomenal as Queen Elizabeth II . The serio-comic approach offers a confusing portrait of the Queen 's public and private faces : part sober drama , part high camp , part soap opera , and part right royal romp . The Queen rules . It is among the best films of the year . It has humor , pathos , intelligence and intrigue . Fully realized characters engage us from start to finish . An intelligent script that keeps in the spirit and tone of Britain 's House of Mountbatten-Windsor , and yet slyly manages a wink at the audience every now and then . Fascinating , funny , wicked and to the point , this is an excellent film about a week every Briton over the age of 15 will remember vividly . 	Full of wit , humor , and pathos , Stephen Frears ' moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana 's death features not one but two remarkable performances , that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair . They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people , giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy .
rocknrolla Flashy but assured , the film is a controlled exercise in style that toes the line but never feels over-the-top . In a word , RocknRolla rocks . It 's a sad experience to watch RocknRolla , the obituary for the Guy Ritchie brand of English gangster flicks . If you 're a fan of the early Ritchie comedy-crime thrillers , then this is not only right up your alley , it 's a long lost relative returning home . Allowing for its air of laddish self-congratulation and its sad whiff of homophobia , Ritchie 's film is arguably his most entertaining to date . Ritchie 's latest homoerotic guy bonding homicidal spree , might be termed a London mafia musical fueled by global capitalism 's shaky economic indicators , going toe to toe with the underground urban economy 's crimelords in cutthroat competition . Literally . The actual plot is so uselessly convoluted you 'd get a headache just reading it -- but you might want to pull out the Advil anyway , given Ritchie 's reliance on flashy editing , a blasting soundtrack and fetishized gunplay . Alas , Guy Ritchie seems to have lost even what little touch he once had , his latest a typically convoluted saga about strangely named big- and little-time crooks that 's fatally deficient in verve . Ritchie 's characters are glamorous underworld fantasies , but he 's incapable of making them resonate ; to stand for something . Even the rock music just seems immature . It 's clearly a crutch , because none of these scenes would be cool without a pounding score ... This is all the kind of abrasive rock that kids like to annoy their parents . Those with stronger sensibilities might enjoy themselves . 	Mixed reviews for Guy Ritchie 's return to his London-based cockney wideboy gangster movie roots , but most agree , it 's a step in the right direction following two major turkeys .
fay grim This is a perfect role for Posey and she plays it to the hilt , with the rest of the cast providing complementary lunacy . Hartley 's film does n't match up to the cockamamy punch of its predecessor , but it 's enough to see Posey run riot through the director 's skewed visions . Recycling espionage-a-go-go conventions while namechecking global conflicts does n't shed light on any state we 're in ; it just feels fatigued . This film feels like Hartley has been handed a Bourne or a Bond movie to direct and maintained his own style and low-budget aesthetic while thoroughly enjoying and deconstructing his new toy . Hartley 's 1997 allegory about art and celebrity `` Henry Fool , '' which divided critics and never found an audience , gets a loose , uneven updating in this surreal espionage thriller that plays like John Le Carre recast as postmodern absurdist yarn . Fay Grim sorely tests the tenacity of [ Hal ] Hartley 's most zealous fans . A stunningly abysmal sequel to 1998 's very interesting Henry Fool . Even the appealing Posey can do little to redeem this totally misguided , convoluted disaster . `` Fay Grim '' is the most inarticulate and grueling of all Hal Hartley 's films , and a complete waste of time . Hartley has chosen the hallmark of a great remake -- reinvention -- in approaching the concept of the sequel , for better and for worse . Fay Grim is less concerned with the details of contemporary spy-craft and global deception than with broader moral questions . 	Fay Grim is too concerned with its own farcical premise to present a coherent , involving story .
carnage It 's ghastly but utterly riveting . Reza is merciless in her dissection of social hypocrisy and she finds a ruthlessly efficient accomplice in Polanski . Great cast ... all in the wrong roles . By singling out the characters and isolating them instead of letting them breathe as a group , Polanski kills the rhythm of the piece . What leaves me deeply uncomfortable is the purely cinematic postscript Polanski tacks on to Yasmina Reza 's play ... It suggests that any moral outrage that erupts over a wrongdoing is wasted energy and anger ... Artistically , this farce is a minor film from Polanski whose ineffective effort to open up the play sacrifices its wit , tension , and tempo . Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are miscast , but Winslet and Waltz are good . The script is full of mean-spiritedness , insensitivity , hypocrisy and projectile vomiting , all of which was frightfully hysterical on stage . Though it should have been an easy transition to film , especially directed by Polanski , it fails miserably . Tensions mount , tempers fray and platitudes are thrown out of the window but Polanski 's comedy of spite is hilarious , cathartic and perfectly-portioned . Each character seems to be rushing through their arguments and it 's as if every single word has been over thought . Involving portrait of two couples meeting to smooth out the rough edges of a mutual problem who wind up letting loose all the anger , disappointment , and hatred inside themselves . Amusing as some of this is , after a while I wanted out . While the talented quartet play these hypocritical sorts with finesse , the story grows tiresome , its cynical point made early and often . 	It is n't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage , but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski 's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster .
religulous Religulous does n't really go anywhere . It 's ultimately a celebration of the old-time religion we call entertainment . Religion will always have a hard time defending itself . By bringing it out into the open , this documentary may only be preaching to the non-converted . Religulous reaffirms Maher 's wit , but it also sheds light on his penchant for moral equivalence . Much of what they 've gotten on film is so entertaining , you almost want to pray for a sequel . A refreshingly courageous and long overdue lecture that is equally enlightening , entertaining and provocative . You ca n't bamboozle a theme park mascot -- even one dressed up as Jesus -- and then ask to be taken seriously . [ The Director ] instead asks `` What if ? '' and allows the interviewee a chance to resolve and hold up their end in the debates and challenges ( or the mind of hang themselves with their rope ) . Which the latter is often the case ... We need skeptics . They infuriate , but they also illuminate , and anybody whose faith ca n't take the knocks that Maher dishes out probably has deeper spiritual issues to deal with . One of the rules of satire is that you ca n't mock things you do n't understand , and Religulous starts developing fault lines when it becomes clear that Maher 's view of religious faith is based on a sophomoric reading of the Scriptures . Maher interviews and ridicules the devout as though he were God . This may be arrogant and paradoxical , especially for an agnostic-atheist -- but it makes for often hilarious entertainment . 	Religulous is funny and offensive in equal measure , and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation .
legend of drunken master Jackie Chan in top form . Contains non-stop action of constantly increasing intensity . [ VIDEO ESSAY ] Jackie Chan 's physical ingenuity brings with it an enormous history as a naturally gifted storyteller whose development dates back to his life as a childhood actor . Chan 's most impressive achievement . If you 've never seen a martial arts movie , this is the one to start with . The fight scenes ... are amazingly staged and astonishingly executed . At long last , the American masses will get a glimpse of what Jackie Chan can really do . The extended fight scenes [ have been ] justly hailed by aficionados as classics of the genre . I 'm extremely unhappy when one of my HK favorites is re-released , re-titled and re-packaged as an English-dubbed Jackie Chan vehicle for American audiences to ostensibly enjoy . Though his antics are comic as ever , what makes this film stand out are the thrilling and frankly beautiful fight sequences . 	Jackie Chan sends up some amazing and entertaining fight sequences in The Legend of Drunken Master .
we were soldiers ... A fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country -- and for each other . Mais uma patriotada que mostra os americanos matando milhares de vietcongues , mas sendo mais 'humanos ' que os inimigos . Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film . For a movie that is based on a true story , We Were Soldiers has a lot of war movie cliches . Fails to bring as much to the table . We Were Soldiers is embarrassingly inept , but it has the kind of ponderousness and serious air ( not to mention the ability to wring tears ) that can fool people . Makes you cry for the hundreds of thousands of men and women who died so pointlessly with Geoghegan . And their orphans . [ H ] ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by . Exposes a great hypocrisy about many war movies : we honor the lives of those men who died for our country by showing them getting shot , impaled , and blown to pieces . 	The war cliches are laid on a bit thick , but the movie succeeds at putting a human face on soldiers of both sides in the Vietnam War .
1213205-prophet Jacques Audiard 's tense , brutal crime pic is a triumph of writing , acting ( by a mostly amateur cast salted in just the right spots by professionals ) , and scene-setting . ... a journey of hard-fought survival told with an unforgettable verve and originality . It may be grim , but ultimately it 's a story of survival , both topical and timeless . Like Goodfellas without the visual fizz , or Scarface played straight , this is , quite simply , one of the greatest prison films ever made . It 's not an easy film to watch . But some very strong performances and some smart material certainly help . Tremendously watchable cinema . A Prophet will be bracketed in years to come as a prison drama , but it will stay in the memory of those who see it as a character study , bristling with cross-currents of feeling and sharp observation . The newcomer Rahim is an enigma . What is he thinking ? I believe that 's the quality Audiard wants . He 's a newly poured man , and when the mold sets , it happens inside . In Jacques Audiard 's haunting prison drama A Prophet , we watch a young man transformed by life behind bars . A Prophet is long and sometimes grueling , but it never feels indulgent or excessive . 	Featuring an impressive star turn by newcomer Tahar Rahim , A Prophet is a French gangster film filled with arresting , immediate details .
a place at the table 2013 A smart , poignantly argued documentary [ which ] casts obesity and hunger as neighbors , and makes a persuasive case for important social investments . It deserves to be seen , along with `` Food , Inc. , '' `` King Corn '' and other muckraking food docs of recent years . An informative and often infuriating picture that deserves to be seen . Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush cover a lot of ground in their heartbreaking documentary examining the hunger experienced by nearly 50 million Americans , but at less than 90 minutes , it feels a bit overstuffed . ... joined by an eclectic array of advocates and advisors to hit home the fact that , daily , millions of Americans go hungry . In addition to the dismaying facts and figures is a fuller sense of what hunger can look like , and feel like , among the millions of Americans classified as `` food-insecure '' ... `` A Place at the Table '' presents a shameful truth that should leave viewers dismayed and angry : This nation has more than enough food for all its people , yet millions of them are hungry . Jacobson and Silverbush invite interest with their regionalized looks at the circumstances of some very engaging individuals . So many of the words spoken in Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush 's moving documentary about hunger in the U.S. , `` A Place at the Table , '' will haunt you long after the film is over . Hunger in America , seen through the eyes of its victims , with an emphasis on children . Sobering documentary addresses a shameful problem . 	A Place at the Table is a well-reported documentary that raises important questions about the state of hunger in America culture .
pale rider See it if you have n't . His saddle bag is a mixed one , though Pale Rider still has the touch of quality associated with latter-day Eastwood . [ Blu-ray ] Not Clint 's best western , but entertaining enough . A severely underrated western , one of Eastwood 's most stylish . ... who else would you want coming to your rescue than the Preacher Man With No Name ? The cowboys of the Old West ride again in this tried and proven Western from Clint Eastwood . [ Eastwood ] understands so well how he works on the screen that the movie has a resonance that probably was not even there in the screenplay . Clint Eastwood stars as the mysterious stranger who arrives in a town and challenges the citizens to fight evil . It had been so long since a quality western had hit America 's screens that it appears as if Eastwood purposely set out to remind audiences of all the elements that make the genre work . Eastwood 's mythic Western divided film critics : Some were baffled by the audacity of his playing a religious figure , while others claimed he was just embodying the mysterious knight-stranger , a common character in classic Westerns . 	Nearly a decade after The Outlaw Josey Wales , Clint Eastwood returns as a director to the genre that made his name with this elegant , spiritual Western that riffs on the classic Shane .
xxx This is action without tension , explosions without the concussion . The same pyrotechnic display we 've come to expect from action-heavy spy films , with the inability to be as edgy as it should have been . It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . Succeeds on the sole basis of getting the heart pumping as one masterfully rendered , if hilariously over-the-top , action set-piece after the next is carried out . That avalanche , which Diesel 's character causes on purpose , is one of the most impressive action sequences I 've ever seen . Despite its detriments , xXx is entertaining -- mostly for one reason : Diesel . This essence of teen boy fantasy , `` The Dirty Dozen '' with one guy playing all twelve parts . It 's just the same old fare : maybe a bit bigger and louder , with some impressive stunts , but still plagued by cliches , sloppy production , leaps of logic , bad acting and even worse dialogue . They were right when they said , `` Nobody does it better . '' Had an irresistable energy , a sense of tongue-in-cheek fun that seems to be missing from a lot of action movies . 	It has an endearing lack of seriousness , and Vin Diesel has more than enough muscle for the starring role , but ultimately , XXX is a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the spy thriller genre .
35 shots of rum Understated , beautifully acted , and with an exacting soundtrack , 35 Shots of Rum goes down easily but packs a subtle kick . Impressively directed , superbly acted drama , though the painfully slow pacing and relative lack of dialogue may prove off putting to some . Modest in scope but very sure , Rum goes down smoothly indeed . A couple of shots of rum would have been a good idea before watching this slow-burning French drama - it would have livened things up . Denis magically evokes a liberal meditation on family , harmony , loyalty and belonging and their corollaries - loss , transgression , loneliness and separation - and achieves a sweet unity . These people feel one hundred percent real , as well-written and completely defined as those living in the apartment next door to you right now . To fall in love with it , viewers only have to be receptive to a movie that examines the ties that bind with grace , wit and depth . Celebrated French filmmaker Claire Denis is a master of atmosphere and immersion . 35 Shots of Rum is visual poetry , but poetry that examines the human condition with insight and illumination . Denis declines to make concessions , she 's willing to show , refuses to tell . 	This slow-moving French family drama is rich , complex , subtle and emotionally eloquent .
dan in real life entyposiaka prosgeiomeno kai pisteyto ( sto megalytero meros toy toylahiston ) , me mia epistrosi glykopikroy glassoy panta paroysa , na kalyptei tis elleipseis stoys arhetypikoys perifereiakoys haraktires kai tis sporadikes symbatikes eksarseis toy eidoys A wry , smart and perceptive dramedy about family and life 's other surprises . Love hurts in cute ( if predictable ) rom com . The movie is called Dan in Real Life , but it 's a stretch worthy of Reed Richards to believe that anything in this tepid plate of idiocy would actually happen in real life . To call this feel-good comedy conservative is to cede 'family values ' to the realm of politics , which , despite a vague NPR-ishness to the characters , is something Real Life refuses to do . Aside from Dan himself , nothing about the movie feels real . Dan in Real Life fires on so many circuits that at times it 's actually shocking how good it is . It tells a funny and emotional story without any of the sentimental shorthand found in most romantic comedies . [ Carell 's ] uncanny ability to make us care what happens to him salvages Dan in Real Life . Thankfully , Hedges keeps his focus and does n't allow the film to just become a series of sketches and syrupy confessionals . It 's the unlikely chemistry between Binoche and Carell coupled with Carell 's impeccable comic timing ( watch out for the shower scene ) that keeps you glued to the screen . 	The fine performances elevate Dan in Real Life beyond its sentimental plot .
1128577-peter pan Hogan introduces a subtle eroticism which gives `` Pan 's '' theme additional complexity for adult viewers which should fly over the heads of children One of those rare films that can be enjoyed over and over again . Simultaneously a faithful retelling of J.M . Barrie 's beloved story and an audacious reinterpretation . It ends up being the grown-up version of a children 's story , and may have trouble finding an audience . Aimed squarely at the child within , the film reaches inside us , grabs hold and never lets go . It wo n't give Harry Potter a run for his money , but it beats the hell out of a Cannon & Ball panto in Skegness . J.M . Barrie 's Peter Pan is a primary text of modern culture , and P.J . Hogan 's live-action rendition is the only one , screen or stage , to completely uncage this changeling and give it flight . [ I ] t 's an unfortunate time for a new version of Peter Pan to hit theaters , but those who can push all those King of Pop connections aside will be rewarded . What it is lacking is any kind of wonder . True fairy dust is in decidedly short supply and without it , the movie sinks like a cannonball . Magical , bittersweet and substantial . 	Solid if far from definitive , this version of Peter Pan is visually impressive , psychologically complex and faithful to its original source .
1158185-see no evil O roteiro no traz uma nica idia original , sendo previsvel do incio ao fim ( com exceo , talvez no que diz respeito ao destino de alguns personagens ) . Ainda assim , o filme funciona graas direo firme do ex-realizador porn ( ! ) Gregory Dark . ... slightly more effective than your average not-screened-for-critics genre entry ... [ A ] blurry , smudged third-generation photocop [ y ] that ca n't even distinguish [ itself ] through attempts at pornographic excess . So undeniably nightmarish it achieves its own ugly integrity ... A predictably gruesome compendium of splatter-movie clichs , See No Evil is a reprehensible exercise in lowest-common-denominator filmmaking that disgusts and bores in equal measure . Manages to startle through the first half and snooze through the second . Gore fans wo n't be disappointed . Assuming there are no other credit cookies , the final image in See No Evil is a dog urinating in an eye socket . There could n't be a better way to describe the experience of watching this film . It is n't the least bit scary -- a considerable liability for a horror film -- but it 's watchable in its own rancid , special little way . If it carries the faint odour of freshly carved teenage flesh , plus a soupcan of plucked eyeball , then you 've sniffed out See No Evil . 	See No Evil is packed with cliches from countless other teen slasher films , making for a predictable , scare-free waste of time .
1083659-rounders A sure bet ! Rounders is less about how the cards are dealt than how people deal with the situations the cards create , and will hook you from beginning to end . O filme possui o mrito de no tentar justificar a moral de seus personagens . You 'll enjoy the superlative acting of Matt Damon , whose dimensions are tested and found in abundance here far more than they appear in his smaller role in Saving Private Ryan . Not a full house by any means . Rounders ' script is pretty shabby going . Well , not shabby , really , just simplistic . A disappointing mediocrity . Mischievously entertaining ! ... flat on substance , poor on relationships , big on predictability , and slow getting anywhere . The struggles of a young man to find his true calling . 	Richly atmospheric and colorful performances contributed to the movie 's entertainment value .
dreamer a chance to see America 's little sweetheart , Dakota Fanning , before she turns 16 , dyes her blonde hair jet black , and pierces something that should n't be pierced All the characters are familiar , the story is familiar , but it is well-constructed and the actors do a good job with the material . Mildly pleasant , but never once does it surprise us . It was incredibly predictable . The characters were cut right out of a template . All the so-called surprises were telegraphed . But I liked it . This time , the formula worked . Too obvious , too trite and too sentimental to ever be more than Seabiscuit for tweens . Whatever its flaws , Dreamer is sure-footed , sure-fire family entertainment . I wonder if the 'true story ' Dreamer was 'inspired by ' was the one where Seabiscuit made over 120 million dollars at the box-office in 2003 ? Ah . Here 's the family film we 've been dreaming of all year long . Will entertain its target audience with ease . A wonderfully pleasing family safe film . The forced family dynamics just drag the movie down . 	Though formulaic , this horse story 's saving grace is its strong performances .
sex and the city Frothy as a Margarita and just as salty , Sex and the City all but mambos its way onto the screen . The ladies settle into the doldrums of marriage and their antics are reduced to a detached series of scenes that involve sulking , yearning or just plain indulging . Cinerina invites her first guest reviewer , Melanie Treco . See full review for details . I love Sarah Jessica Parker ... Carrie and Mr. Big are definitely the best things about this film . But , at 2.5 hours long , there 's just not enough good stuff to put this one over the top . I hate the sound of Kim Cattrall speaking , so that did n't help . The end product is a case of bigger not necessarily being better . an honest and consistent continuation of the show The movie Sex and the City is a heady female fantasy -- I think . I tried to snuggle up to Sex and the City , but the attempt to snuggle for two hours and 20 minutes is in itself a fantasy . Like many typical men , I 'm afraid I fell asleep . The movie , scripted and directed by series veteran Michael Patrick King , caters to viewers nostalgic for the Emmy-winning show while pushing forward into feature film territory . Sarah Jessica Parker is the pivot for this fabulous , fun frolic in which laughter and tears are shared through thick and thin , but always with glamour and style . A girl can never have too many outfits , but a film can have too many scenes . 	Sex and the City loses steam in the transition to the big screen , but will still thrill fans of the show .
hotaru no haka ... a beautiful lament and a moving tribute to the people we rarely consider when we think about World War 2 : those Japanese who suffered for the crimes of their leaders . Writer-director Isao Takahata , a frequent collaborator of Miyazaki 's at Studio Ghibli , adapted a partly autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka , and his handling of the tragic story is masterfully understated . ... a well-made and heartfelt drama that 's just not as engrossing as it should be . The ephemeral fireflies , which fascinate the children and accompany them everywhere , become a potent and lyrical symbol of the fragility , brevity and beauty of life . There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight , too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing . The stylised images suit the simplicity and gravity of a grim story of love , sacrifice and survival in the face of adult indifference and cruelty . I doubt this story could have been as successful as a straight drama . The spirits of Seita and Setsuko can not really be filmed except as animated figures . Japanimation WWII tragedy the saddest . Cartoon . Ever . Um retrato sem concesses do horror da guerra e de suas conseqncias no apenas sobre a sociedade , mas sobre indivduos comuns . Emocionalmente devastador . Very simply the gentlest and most touching war-related film I 've ever seen . 	An achingly sad anti-war film , Grave of the Fireflies is one of Studio Ghibli 's most profoundly beautiful , haunting works .
freshman orientation There are other things to like about writer-director Ryan Shiraki 's college comedy , mainly that it feels more real than most ... Just one problem : It is n't particularly funny . Consider my two-star rating an indication that the film 's Gut-Buster-to-Forehead-Slapper ratio is relatively even . ... might push boundaries better were it not so painfully unfunny . Freshman Orientation feels a bit like a missed opportunity . It 's too bad the motion picture as a whole is n't as quirky and clever as its double-edged title . Freshman Orientation barely rates a passing grade . Theatres showing it will likely have as many conspicuously empty seats as the classrooms and barrooms in this picture , which was apparently shot on such a shoestring that they could n't even get enough extras to fill a set . The film 's abundant humor and sharp tongue give way to watery romantic-comedy conventions in the end . Freshman Orientation is not incompetently made . Nor is it badly acted . But there 's not a fresh idea in it , and everyone on screen seems to be in a different comedy . Admirably aiming to recreate the feelings of newfound freedom and self-discovery that college inspires , Freshman Orientation never finds a way to successfully execute its good intentions . This trivial film toys with the postmodern lifestyles . 	This over-the-top comedy suffers from an exhaustive screenplay , which tries too hard to be funny ... and fails .
treasure of the sierra madre There 's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter . The film plays as a morality fable , showing that the deadliest dangers to man are in his soul and not from the external dangers . Uma fabulosa atuao de Humphrey Bogart ( completamente esquecido no Oscar daquele ano , numa das maiores injustias que a Academia j cometeu ) . an unconventional western and a serious drama Arguably John Huston 's greatest film , this powerful study of masculinity under pressure retains its power . Transcends the medium to become a mandatory viewing experience for anyone that identifies themselves as a human being , period . A finely-crafted western-style character drama where greed and paranoia drive desperate men over the edge . Riveting , downbeat , and surprising , a gripping adventure and one of Hollywood 's most resonant morality tales a smart , remorseless story of gold , greed , guns , and guile . A powerful morality tale whose humour is as black as the heart of its central character , but as humane as the men who survive their brush with greed . Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances in John Huston 's chronicle of greed and crime , for which Walter Huston ( John 's son ) won the Supporting Oscar ; years later Jonn 's daughter won the Oscar . 	Remade but never duplicated , this darkly humorous morality tale represents John Huston at his finest .
wendy and lucy What comes across more powerfully is the sense of alienation and the simple tragedy of a human being whose only meaningful connection to the world comes through her friendship with an animal . Deliberately paced -- slow , even -- it 's nevertheless an amazing , timely parable for increasingly desperate times . Told sparely and with deliberate pacing , it 's a profoundly tender , deceptively simple story . Even as Wendy 's desperate situation magnifies every triumph and setback , Williams remains a remarkably grounded presence . It is quite likely the year 's best screen acting . Like Reichardt , Williams does a lot with very little , culminating in a bittersweet , quietly moving finale . Even when her character keeps her emotions firmly in check , Williams invests the role with heartfelt , heartbreaking feeling . America is full of people like Wendy Carroll , the young woman at the center of director Kelly Reichardt 's small , supple new film Wendy and Lucy . Reichardt , who directed Old Joy , does n't so much tell a story as paint a finely detailed portrait of human suffering in this miniature marvel . Coming from any other filmmaker , Wendy and Lucy 's relatively clear-eyed and unsentimental tale of woe might be considered a minor triumph , but from one of Reichardt 's unique talents , it is something of a letdown . Writing this review gave me more appreciation for the film as a work than I had while I was watching it . Perhaps it was intended to be more like a lovely poem or a painting . 	Michelle Williams gives a heartbreaking performance in Wendy and Lucy , a timely portrait of loneliness and struggle .
the muppets A luminous and loving tribute to the man who breathed life into nothing but felt and faux fur . A Muppet film that not only lives up to the franchise legacy and , for some , might just end up being one of their all-time favorite adventures with Kermit and the gang . It is a film that works for ... fans who remember what the Muppets were but it 's also a great way of establishing who the Muppets are . Muppet News Flash ! Your friends in felt are back on the big screen , ready and waiting to charm a new generation of ... moppets . The muppets are back , just like we remember them , with catchy tunes and meta humor . Also , a great cast of cameo appearances is paired with a fun story and iconic characters that have n't been detrimentally modernized . A mixed bag then : The Muppets is n't the best or the worst of Kermit 's big-screen capers . At least it 's a reminder that here 's one frog who is n't about to croak . A heap o ' feel-good , wholesome , splashy fun . Fun songs , great humor , and a lot of entertaining cameos make The Muppets a fun movie for both adults and children . It 's a good revitalization of the Muppets franchise . Sweet and silly , this nostalgic reboot is fuzzy , family-friendly fare . So genial , so joyous , and suffused with such a lip-smacking sweetness , that the occasional pacing issues and subplot hiccups simply do n't seem to matter . 	Clever , charming , and heartfelt , The Muppets is a welcome big screen return for Jim Henson 's lovable creations that will both win new fans and delight longtime devotees .
xxx state of the union A humorless foray of noise and fast-cuts signifying nothing much . ... going for the hip hop-loving teen market ( both city and suburbs ) that is more than willing to drop big money on flashy hubcaps , flavor-of-the-month CDs and crappy movies . Succumbs to a depth of directorial incompetence not seen since the likes of Megaforce ... an unimaginative , derivative , and ultimately dull riff on the Bond series . Viewed on its own trashy terms , it succeeds brilliantly . I do n't know about the state of the union , but the state of this movie franchise is gosh-awful . Despite its title , XXX : State of the Union is neither pornographic nor political . Mostly an excuse for cramming as much gratuitous violence as possible into a PG-13-rated flick running only 92 minutes . At mesmo Vin Diesel , astro do pavoroso Operao Bab , percebeu que este projeto era ruim . Preciso dizer mais ? This xXx seems to know exactly how stupid it is , and this kind of self-knowledge helps nudge it toward the guilty pleasure bracket , even if it never quite makes that leap . 	Even more absurd and implausible than the first XXX movie , State of the Union is less inspired and technically competent than its predecessor .
devils backbone In the end , Backbone is about showing off a horror film director 's tools of trade . Pure , uncut del Toro . The filmmaker accomplishes riveting scenes of suspense and scares he honestly come by , sticking the landing of every effect he attempts . [ Blu-ray ] You may find that images from this movie clamber back into your memory weeks after you see it , and give your spine a chill . Creepy , meaty , crafty and fun . After a leisurely first half , The Devil 's Backbone becomes utterly spellbinding , its tension mounting in steady increments . One of those rare films that can frighten you without feeling the need to be flashy about it . Sublimely atmospheric but erratically chilling , ... it 's too hung up on being more than just a ghost story . It stands alongside this year 's The Others as a coolly accomplished ghost story that does n't have to resort to screaming teens . For those who can stomach this kind of thing , [ del Toro has ] delivered a haunting work of art that will stay with you for some time . The acting is clunky , and the story is straight-to-midnight-movie stunted and not very believable . 	Creepily atmospheric and haunting , The Devil 's Backbone is both a potent ghost story and an intelligent political allegory .
baader meinhof complex The Baader-Meinhof Complex is diluted by too many events and characters distributed over too much time . Watching The Baader-Meinhof Complex is like a trip to a recent past that is too easily forgotten . It 'd be nice to see an American filmmaker commit a similar reckoning with the Watts riots , the Weather Underground , or the Black Power movement , not simply resort to cant and kitsch but to really interpret those moments . Merely lets the facts of forty years ago speak for themselves , and one ca n't deny that its dramatization of them has enormous energy and urgency . It does take awhile for the plot to really kick into gear . Yet the discussion of terrorist morality is interesting , and there are some very tense sequences . ... a watery historic stew crammed with too many events and not enough context or character development to fill out what could have been a compelling film . The movie has an undeniable sweep , increasing in intensity once the principals are arrested in June 1972 . A sweeping docudrama of recent history in Germany regarding home-grown terrorism . Baad and Baader extreme women rule , in this bold , more-than-meets-the eye brand of moviemaking , while the impassioned political thriller dissects the Red Army Faction 's ideological seduction of actually one fourth of the German population . A thoroughly engrossing tale of conflicting agendas and thwarted ambition . In its verve and verisimilitude , the film recalls such classics of political cinema as Z and The Battle of Algiers . 	Intricately researched and impressively authentic slice of modern German History , with a terrific cast , assured direction , and a cracking script .
before sunset Richard Linklater 's Before Sunrise gets a sweet , sad and touching sequel after almost a decade . While it 's not necessary to see Before Sunrise again , it 's essential that you have seen it . [ Get ] the original , and then go see one of the best movies of the year ... There 's enough here that a thirtysomething audience , mindful of the complexity of their lives and their own missed opportunities , might respond to . But there is n't much magic . Here 's an unusual sequel to an equally unusual film from nine years ago . The naturalistic dialogue is a masterful bit of writing . The result is a complicated and thrilling game that , unlike some diversions we have had lately , does not debase the words `` romantic '' and `` comedy . '' A vibrant emotional epic . Proves itself well worth the nine-year wait , and for a sequel so squarely rooted in the first film , it stands lightly on its own two feet . In its own small way , 'Before Sunset ' is a perfect film ... there is not a single scene in this film that I would want to change or alter in any way . The beauty and grace of Before Sunset is its unparalleled ability to capture the idiosyncratic rhythm and cadence of everyday dialogue . 	Filled with engaging dialogue , Before Sunset is a witty , poignant romance , with natural chemistry between Hawke and Delpy .
backdraft Typical over-produced , lowest-common-denominator Ron Howard film Howard 's burning ode to firefighters and the professional and personal lives they hope to conquer with devotion and defiance . A drama that convincingly spreads itself like a roaring blaze . Ron Howard popcorn-muncher is sappy , not smokin ' . Backdraft has some of the raw filmmaking excitement that has been missing from Howard 's recent work . The three separate elements do n't quite gel , but the overall experience is still a fine bit of moviemaking . Visually speaking , the film does pretty well with fire-as-spectacle , less well with everything else ( Howard tends to trot out fuzzy-toned Spielbergian backlighting on any pretext ) . It 's spectacular , yes , but that 's not all . Not only do the firefighting scenes evoke a feeling of gritty authenticity , but the fire itself really does seem to be alive . Manipulative ? Yes . But damn , citywide funerals , a cranked score , and some Baldwin blue steel redemption poses clears away any irksome storytelling dissatisfaction . Nice action movie . Great effects . A patchwork concoction of other ( better ) movies , but the gung-ho ensemble keeps it all afloat . 	It 's not particularly deep , but Backdraft is a strong action movie with exceptional special effects .
the-eagle-of-the-ninth Do you like movies about gladiators ? Well , lend me your ears : The Eagle will more than gratify your sword-and-sandal cravings . If we 're forced to choose one contemporary Romans 'n ' barbarians movie , this is the one . The Eagle reaches for more than your typical glories-of-death saga . It 's interested in story and character . Unfortunately , the story is not terribly compelling . Nearly everything in The Eagle feels like text carved into a tablet , and the stolid Tatum 's lack of an inner life reinforces that miscalculation . The Eagle makes for an okay parent-and-young-son film outing . But you 'll want to get your youngster the Sutcliff paperback . Fierce yet fragmented , slogging through the story of colliding cultures and one centurion 's quest to regain family honor . Tatum mounts barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries . Becomes absurd precisely when Channing Tatum marches onto the scene as a Roman army commander . Tatum holds his own . I can find many faults with The Eagle , but he is not one of them . The Eagle is exactly what you 'd imagine a movie about Roman centurions should be -- if , that is , you 're 12 years old and have a fairly limited imagination . 	The Eagle has a pleasantly traditional action-adventure appeal , but it 's drowned out by Kevin Macdonald 's stolid direction and Channing Tatum 's uninspired work in the central role .
harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 2011 From any perspective-technical , emotional , storytelling- '' Deathly Hallows : Part 2 '' is a smashing success . Tears are shed for the lost , cheers are raised for the ( often unexpectedly ) brave and noble , and , in the movie 's final moments , there is a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment rarely achieved in filmmaking . As they say , all good things must come to an end . But in this instance , you can take solace in knowing the fat lady can belt out one heck of a final note . Thanks for the memories , Harry Potter . We 'll miss you . I must confess to being completely unmoved by the Harry Potter phenomenon . The books strike me as derivative and bland , and the film versions are , if anything , even worse . A well-rounded , entertaining and satisfying conclusion to this epic series . ( Full Content Parental Review also available ) As a standalone film , it delivers intense and engaging action . Though , I could n't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the final battle sequence we have waited ten years to see . A wholly-satisfying finale to what is unquestionably the greatest coming-of-age saga ever committed to film . This is a massive , tentpole , franchise movie with impeccable good taste -- its most essential , surprising and exhilarating ingredient . An unbelievably satisfying bookend that is not only Yates ' finest entry yet , but one of the best films in the series . Watched as a stand-alone film it 's likely to strike newcomers as completely mystifying , but committed and even semi-committed fans will surely welcome it as a worthy climax to the most successful film franchise in history . 	Thrilling , powerfully acted , and visually dazzling , Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion .
biutiful Gonzlez Irritu sigue siendo un estupendo realizador , pero abunda en clichs y marcas de estilo que saturan y alargan la pelcula . Javier Bardem , como casi siempre , est excelente . It would be impossible to list the Oscar-worthy performances of 2010 without highlighting Javier Bardem in Biutiful . The movie 's mood might well have proved unendurable were it not for the proud and sympathetic presence of Bardem . Rarely has an actor anchored a wobbly movie so confidently as Bardem does here . He displays an astonishing range of emotions , from love to anger to shock and horror , with a conviction that is something close to awesome . Watching Bardem occupy , embrace and ultimately own a multifaceted role like the one he plays in `` Biutiful '' is a rare treat , and an absolute joy . It 's The Human Centipede for people who think they 're too fancy for The Human Centipede . Javier Bardem was Oscar-nominated for his performance and the film got a nod for best foreign-language film , but do n't let that fool you ; it 's a stodgy , self-important slog . Like Babel , it takes some interesting ideas and belabors them for well over two fidgety hours . Irritu has made a modern classical tragedy and , in Javier Bardem , he has found his first authentic hero ; a character caught up in an intricate web of events he can not extricate himself from . The film is beautifully photographed and incredibly effective . Holding it all together is a brilliant central performance by Javier Bardem . 	Javier Bardem 's searing performance helps to elevate Biutiful , as does Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu 's craftsmanship , but the film often lapses into contrivance and grimness .
1153719-syrian bride Eran Riklis 's tightly wound film is about a bride-to-be trapped between Syria and Israel . An extraordinary Israeli film that is unlike any other wedding film ever made ! The real interest in the film enters by the side door , through supporting characters . It seems to line up every conceivable cultural , sexual or religious fender-bender it can for maximum conflict . But at the same time , Israeli director Eran Riklis and Palestinian co-writer Suha Arraf use the device to reveal touching human complexity . As enjoyable a piece of cultural satire as any that 's come out of this highly troubled region . This Israeli effort is a humanistic drama -- shot through with believable , everyday comic moments -- that personalizes the political agenda in the Middle East . [ Director Eran Riklis ] has much to say about the invisible lines that separate people , and rein in dreams . An engrossing absurdist comedy . The lapses are eclipsed by an abiding empathy toward his characters . I like everything about The Syrian Bride except the title . And , in the grand scheme of things , that 's no big deal . 	A humane and empathic work , The Syrian Bride depicts the personal impact of politics upon individuals .
wild wild west Wild , Wild West poses this not very pressing question : Can a comedy costing something north of $ 100 million hope to succeed solely on the basis of special effects , cross-dressing and a vertically challenged villain ? The sheer fun generated by the characterizations will provide enough entertainment value for the average moviegoer . The Summer 's best reason to count popcorn kernels , unless you find yourself counting sheep first . In this noisy , joyless , bizarrely static fiasco , every element on screen seems to let the air out of the one before it . It was fun . The contempt for the audience displayed in Wild Wild West is breathtaking . E a histria ? Sonnenfeld 's cheerful irreverence keeps it reasonable . No-surprises , entirely by-the-numbers plot . Jump on the bandwagon , because it 's really THAT bad . 	Bombastic , manic , and largely laugh-free , Wild Wild West is a bizarre misfire in which greater care was lavished upon the special effects than on the script .
winter passing Unfortunately , this too-dour film ca n't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama . As a result , it does n't really work as either . [ Zooey ] Deschanel carries the heavy and sometimes uneven Winter Passing , which possesses not only a love of language but a moving adoration for the language of love . This is the kind of movie routinely dismissed as too slow and quiet by those who do n't know it is more exciting to listen than to hear . If you 're looking for something a bit more lighthearted , head elsewhere . But that does n't mean we 're going to give a bad Rapp to this dark and complex tale . And therein lies the chief problem with Winter Passing : there 's very little nuance to -- any of the characters in Rapp 's meandering narrative , which the first-time director wraps up on an emotionally pat note that does n't feel earned . Rapp 's theatrical past is evident throughout : His strongest scenes tend to be those purely character-driven moments when his sharp dialogue takes precedence over any cinematic action . This could easily slip over into the realm of the melodramatic , but the solid performances keep it from going over the edge ( but just barely ) . There is n't a spark in the familiar emotional situation or a reason to care how these amiably bland characters end up . ... a finding-yourself drama that gets lost in unnecessary character quirks . The way it 's done is so authentic , and you have such good performances from everybody involved here , and some very true writing . 	This dour coming-of-age story has nothing to distinguish it from similarly themed indie fare .
thousand acres I do n't know anything to redeem the movie except for an understated performance from Leigh -- unless you 're into masochism . Avoid . You 'll be shocked to discover how much of the novel 's richness has been lost . at the heart of this sometimes strident movie are two magnificent performances , which redeem everything that surrounds them . Robards ' senile paterfamilias is , regrettably , a grave embarrassment . The story is just an empty , manipulative compilation of tragedies and misunderstandings . Little more than slightly affecting . From the first frame , a silhouetted barn and windmill at dawn , the images feel prefab , and the all-purpose wistful tinkly piano and sighing strings pin them even more boringly down . Talented cinematographer Tak Fujimoto does his best to capture Smiley 's Iowa landscapes visually , but his is an effort doomed to failure . Proof that Hollywood no longer knows how to make that former staple , the women 's picture . It 's a pretty powerful analysis of an extended family ( where lifelong friends in farming are integral to the well being of a community ) shot apart by power and greed . 	A Thousand Acres makes disappointingly sudsy stuff out of the source material , but benefits from solid performances by a strong cast .
mostly martha The joy arrives only over the end titles and by then the audience will have headed for the nearest bistro . likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . Other than the abrupt , rushed ending , the rest of the movie is meticulously crafted . A comedy that not only serves up the laughs , but also great-looking entrees and a dash of romance . A satisfying dish . Sandra Nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed Martha as her heart begins to open . Closely tracking in the footsteps of dramatic food flicks like Big Night , this movie is a little different in that it lives up to its moniker . Sweet without being saccharine and funny without being forced . Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle . The only pain you 'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . The gorgeous food preparation scenes would be enough to separate Martha from other films of this ilk , but Nettlebeck is also blessed with a score of great performances . 	Mostly Martha may have a predictable plot , but it still feels charming and fresh , and the food will make you hungry .
sky captain Kerry Conran imagines an adventure cobbled together from serials , comic books , and radio dramas of the 30s and 40s , making something derivative yet unique . It 's worth the money to see it on the big screen . an imminently likable action-adventure throwback that reflects the saucy give-and-take of old movies as much as it does their visual schemes A case of too much style over too little substance . [ Law and Paltrow ] , not the gewgaws of the computer age , make Sky Captain fly . This pulp fantasy spectacle is a fond tribute to beloved Movies -- with a capital M . With its silky textures and fluffed up fake-studio imagery , Sky Captain is like a big warm pillow that threatens to smother you in downy gorgeousness . His nostalgia enabled by technology , Conran takes the ghosts in his machine seriously , and the results appear at once meltingly lovely and intriguingly inhuman . Walks the walk but can not talk the talk The most whizbang combination of new cinema technology and old-fashioned Saturday-matinee storytelling since George Lucas ' original Star Wars . 	Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is slim on plot and characterization , but the visuals more than make up for it .
1003707-casablanca Overblown . It is one of the most timeless of all movies in terms of topic , emotion , acting and motivation . Nobody lights a torch like Ingrid Bergman 's Ilsa or carries one like Humphrey Bogart 's Rick . It is a pragmatic and darkly humorous essay on aspects of the human condition , ending on a melancholy note that reverberates through even Renault 's semi-vulnerable heart . Curtiz 's film is a classic for a reason -- it 's crafted with the precision , detail and beauty of a Faberg egg ; the dialogue is hauntingly memorable and , in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman , it has one of the most magnetic screen pairings in history . Nothing short of an invasion could add much to Casablanca . One of the best movies ever . The romantic pain still holds up , and political intrigue still compels . To many , this is the best love story ever , if not the greatest film of all times . The worlds favorite Hollywood love story is all the more romantic because it does n't exalt romantic love above all . The script and direction are crisp and clear , the story is compelling and the casting is first-rate . 	An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood 's quintessential statement on love and romance , Casablanca has only improved with age , boasting career-defining performances from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman .
1103080-chocolat Chocolat is awful . A charming film with serious undertones . Unfortunately , Chocolat is missing the bitter spices that give chocolate its soul . It melts in your mouth , but not in your mind . The mix of great filmmaking and great food will put you in Hershey heaven -- or at least makes you wish you were there . An appealing comic fable aimed at those with a bittersweet tooth . A trifle as sweet and unfilling as a truffle . Chocolat , like Hallstrom 's adaptation of The Cider House Rules , succeeds primarily through its casting . So assured in its manipulative prowess that only afterward do you realize how fully you 've been worked over . Lasse Halstrm used to direct more interesting films than this . Hallstrom is too lazy to bother inventing any new ways to tell this story . 	Chocolat is a charmingly light-hearted fable with a lovely performance by Binoche .
1029314-dick tracy Dick Tracy is Batman in a fedora -- a much-ballyhooed cartoon noir that 's as skimpy on substance as it is burgeoning with jujube-colored , jutt-jawed style . This is a unique movie experience , well conceived and executed . Summer has n't officially arrived yet , but it 's unlikely to offer a big-budget commercial movie as thoroughly entertaining as this stylish real-life cartoon . Saved from sheer mediocrity by Al Pacino A colorful and mostly entertaining little experiment . This is a movie in which every frame contains some kind of artificial effect . An entire world has been built here , away from the daylight and the realism of ordinary city streets . Should have stayed in the funny pages . A ground-breaking and striking comic-based movie , though the villains are too easily vanquished The movie may lack unified conception , but it 's supremely entertaining due to sumptuous production , lavish imagery and opulent costumes , and some terrific cameo appearances , such as Al Pacino . It 's fun spotting stars under cakes of make-up and the panache , great supporting cast and good-natured , old-fashioned feel make for a better movie than you remember . 	Dick Tracy is stylish , unique , and an undeniable technical triumph , but it ultimately struggles to rise above its two-dimensional artificiality .
keeping the faith The script administers a relentless string of laughs , most of them genuinely funny . The first film in years to present two servants of God as ardent , idealistic , hard-working , and interesting people . Keeping the Faith is a profoundly secular movie . A sweet , unexpectedly thoughtful , and decidedly un-edgy romantic comedy -- an unexpected choice for Norton 's directorial debut It 's adult and humane , genuinely sexy , laugh-out-loud funny . It 's a funny , bright , witty and , above all , cute romantic comedy . A high-spirited , feel-good film which avoids the sophomoric predictability . There is genuine chemistry among this trio that is fun to watch , and the script will keep you giggling . Even with its few flaws , it 's a decent little film that manages to balance slapstick comedy while not shying away from the lead characters ' issues of faith . You wo n't have a bad time . 	A dramedy featuring an unusual love triangle , Keeping the Faith is a perceptive look at how religion affects us in everyday life .
divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood It has some deft things to say about the way that children come to understand their parents , though it 's never less than self-conscious about its need to win us over . It does n't help that the script considers elderly characters swearing and discussing alcoholism to be the pinnacle of comic genius . They followed the outline of the book but stripped away the subtlety and depth that provided such pleasure . Like an Overacting Anonymous meeting for prestigious female actresses eager to try their hands at obnoxious braying and outrageously broad antics . ... if you plan on having a man watch this film with you , do him a favor ... and do n't . This Southern-belle saga is convinced that it 's charming enough to mow down any viewer 's skepticism . For the most part , its confidence is justified . The result is far from convincing -- though its sentimental melodrama may appeal to women of a certain age who are looking for an alternative to bingo . Chick flick for mom ; teens may not enjoy it . While this film has an 'A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . That such strong , capable women are called on to carry a film as shoddy as Ya-Ya in front of and from behind the camera is hardly progress . 	Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is more melodramatic than emotionally truthful , and uneven in its mixture of time periods , actresses , laughter and tears .
touch of pink It provides plenty of laughs to make it enjoyable and enough substance to make it worth your time . Despite being a tad too familiar and tired in premise , film contains some charming performances and quirky script . [ has the ] light touch that characterized those fluffy romances that Hollywood churned out with wild abandon during its Golden Age , and then gives it some bite Could have made more of its quirks , but for all its sincerity , it 's just another banal coming-out movie . Amuses and delights far more than it fails to surprise . A gay romantic comedy so coyly inoffensive that it becomes offensive in its inoffensiveness . ... more self-congratulatory than genuinely edgy , and the best reason to see it is MacLachlan 's tidy impersonation . Touch of Pink depicts the romantic challenges of a gay photographer in London who is carrying on a fantasy life with the spirit of Cary Grant . Just imagine all the screwball possibilities -- they 're squandered here . The only real touch of class in the rickety little romantic comedy is Kyle MacLachlan 's dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant 's ghost . 	Kyle MacLachlan does a very good imitation Cary Grant in this forced and contrived tale .
stake land The relationships between the characters are not allowed to fully develop , so that the audience can neither genuinely root for them , nor really despise them . Like the film version of Cormac McCarthy 's The Road , it has quasi-religious overtones and one very good scene ... An angsty , bleak fantasy of America the lost . A confident piece of genre filmmaking that not only deserves a wider audience but hints at truly great things to come for its talented director . Fans of Cormac McCarthy 's `` The Road '' will find much to enjoy in this sombre and nerve-wracking postapocalyptic horror film , directed and co-written by Jim Mickle . The Road on supernatural steroids , the New York Times called it , and that 's a pretty good short handle for it . You might be left cold at the end of Stake Land when the question of what this particular variant is going to do differently is answered with a half-hearted shrug . This disposable vampire/zombie re-hash horror show from director Jim Mickle is cinematic dog food . Forget what you think you know about horror . This one 's a game-changer . Some numbers are too large to contemplate . How many drops of water are there in the ocean ? How many grains of sand are there in the desert ? How many more apocalyptic zombie movies must I sit through ? 	Though the genre is well worn at this point , director Jim Mickle focuses on strong characterization and eerie atmosphere to craft an effective apocalyptic vampire chiller that also manages to pack a mean punch .
1096832-where the heart is Episodic , uneven screenplay . This is a special . A rambling but rich examination of both the human spirit and the oft-undiscussed need for a greater community that each of us can plug into . It 's hard to shake the feeling that somebody 's being condescended to . The scenes feel forced , producing episodic plotting and calling attention to the characters ' superficiality . The story is sweet . This is as irritating as chick flicks come and it 's a real disappointment since Portman 's talents are totally wasted . A swamp of clichs , contrivances , and cheap ham-and-cheese hero sentimentality . Crappy writing and overall shoddy construction . Sure , there are men in this movie , but they simply can not compete with the likes of Portman , Sarandon , Channing , Judd , Cusack , and Fields . 	Poor script and messy plot undermines the decent cast .
james journey to jerusalem Here is a creative parable about a young Christian pilgrim from Africa whose quest to see the holy city is set aside as he undergoes a series of trials and tribulations . An intriguing fable . The most vital force in this movie is actor Shibe . As James , his tenacious naivete gives the movie a sort of heartening electricity . Much of the charm of James is attributable to Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe , the absorbing South African actor who portrays the enchantingly guileless religious pilgrim of the title . A smart and satisfying parable about immigrant exploitation that does n't pander to mainstream liberal attitudes about victimization . There 's genuine tragedy in watching James tumble down the spiritual ladder from missionary to mercenary ... Shibe plays the arc beautifully . Alexandrowciz 's first feature is a scathing condemnation of the rampant venality he perceives as having gripped his country . James offers an ironic yet unflinching look at some of the least idealistic , most cutthroat aspects of Israeli society . a witty fable that explores modern Israeli society through the eyes of a wide-eyed outsider An engaging and poignant film , one that could only be done by an insider . 	A smart and funny social satire about modern-day Jerusalem .
rushmore There 's a sweet humanity about the picture , though it 's anything but sentimental . It 's odd , definitely odd . Rushmore is often touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious . Rushmore is a truly American film that deserves to be seen by many , many people . A wickedly funny high school comedy for most of its running time , Rushmore is a bracingly fresh and original outing . A quirky comedy about an egocentric young man who proves himself to be an eager student of life . Just when you expect the film to do something normal , it takes off like Murray -- riffing on reality as only he , and filmmaker Anderson , can . [ Rushmore is ] structured like a comedy , but there are undertones of darker themes , and I almost wish they 'd allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows . Besides being a terrific film in its own right , seen today , Rushmore almost seems like a trailer for the films that have followed it . With only his second film Anderson proves himself a director so in command of his medium he can ignore convention and make films his own way . ... a movie about overt passion -- passion that is genuine and deserved as well as passion that is a kind of mask . 	This cult favorite is a quirky coming of age story , with fine , off-kilter performances from Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray .
best years of our lives Fine movie for families with older kids . The best coming home movie ever made . [ A ] powerful , if cumbersome prestige picture . The feeling of warmth and satisfaction that accompanies the conclusion is the hallmark of a great drama . ... captures the sort of confusion , condescension and even revulsion faced by returning veterans , then and today . Profoundly and sensitively balances the private demons of scarred veterans and the press of public policies that leave their mark on daily life . Este belssimo estudo sobre as seqelas sociais e psicolgicas da guerra ( para no mencionar as fsicas ) permanece atual mais de 60 anos depois de seu lanamento , impressionando no s pelas atuaes , mas tambm pelo virtuosismo esttico . Post-war Hollywood drama at its heartfelt best . The film captured the mood of post-WWII America so well that even harsher critics like James Agee failed to see the film 's dramatic flaws , instead stressing its realism and black-and-white deep focus photography by Gregg Toland . One of the best pictures of our lives . 	An engrossing look at the triumphs and travails of war veterans , The Best Years of Our Lives is concerned specifically with the aftermath of World War II , but its messages speak to the overall American experience .
hustler A Streetcar Named Desire for the con man . A rich paean to the low-life pool players , dank pool halls and its pool sharks . So much more than the ups and downs of one pool player -- It 's shot in a very realistic way and deals with inner conflict and what it means to be a man . Strikes that magical balance between a phenomenal cast , a director with a gift for shadow and mood , and a near-perfect screenplay . This is the purest examination of an athlete 's internal struggle ever mounted for the screen . An extraordinarily accomplished noir drama about pool , with top notch peformance from Paul Newman as the jaded player and exemplary supporting cast headed by Piper Laurie , George C. Scott , and Jackie Gleason . This picture is so much better than Martin Scorsese 's belated sequel The Color of Money that they do n't even belong in the same category . This is one of Newman 's very best films , if not his best , even if it 's relentlessly depressing . Newman and Scott smolder through the moody black-and-white cinematography , delivering line after line of crackling dialogue . Newman is better than usual ; Gleason , as the slit-mouthed , beady-eyed Minnesota Fats , darts among the shabby little pool sharks like an improbably agile and natty whale ; and Gambler Scott looks as though he could sell hot-air heat to the devil . 	Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason give iconic performances in this dark , morally complex tale of redemption .
casino royale A smartly written , tautly acted dramatic thriller , but it 's so long that it feels like we 've watched an entire trilogy . A muscular action film blissfully free of winking . The most believable Bond since the days of Connery and for the first time in decades , I left the theater with the distinct reaction that I wanted to be James Bond . Brilliant director Martin Campbell brings in the best Bond film since Goldfinger , one with an actual script to go with the stunts , even if Craig ca n't compete with Connery when it comes to bon mots . The best Bond in years and one of the best of all time . It has one element missing from almost every other action film being made today -- class . Crass product placement , implausible dialogue , plot points that drag on , Casino Royale has them all . The reason none of that really matters is Daniel Craig . After seeing this performance one can only be excited at the prospect of watching Craig 's Bond mature and change over the course of several films . Fans of anyone other than Sean Connery who has played James Bond may want to look away , because admirers of Ian Fleming 's 007 novels are almost bound to agree that Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean . Casino Royale maintains Bond on the same level quality-wise ; it 's good but not the great film I keep waiting for . 	Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings , and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for : a caustic , haunted , intense reinvention of 007 .
duck season 2006 The stage is set , not quite for action -- the delightful , odd ball group never leaves the apartment -- but for a little sexual experimentation , serious baking , casual drug use , and the kind of unexpected , meaningful conversation that results in revelation . Runs more on charm than inspiration , but it convincingly conveys something of the terrible , giddy solipsism of adolescence , with its contradictory longings for freedom and security ... The tender and droll Mexican charmer Duck Season captures the stalled rhythms of a lazy Sunday shared by pals , a time of idleness in which pleasure gets tangled with melancholy . Eimbcke makes the most of his enclosed space and eager cast to string together a series of droll vignettes that eventually add up to a satisfying and touching story . I have one word for these kids : Monopoly . Duck Season is definitely worth seeing , but mostly it is worth seeing past , into the future of a promising new filmmaker . A sweet , charming film about friendship and the pangs of adolescence , enhanced by gorgeous black and white photography and four splendid performances . Eimbcke attempts to give this story a melancholy overlay , but its main interest is in its confirmation that teenagers are pretty much the same everywhere . Subtly rendered details about each of Eimbcke 's four characters gradually rise to the surface . The film hints at homosexuality , touches on adolescent sexuality , teenage ennui ( 'There 's nothing to do ! ' ) , friendship , loneliness and probably a few other themes . 	This modest cinematic slice-of-life manages to subtly capture many small but resonant and truthful moments of adolescence .
firewall It 's not long before the timely issue of identity theft takes a backseat to old-fashioned Hollywood villainy , unnecessary ( and nonsensical ) red herrings , and stuff that does n't make sense . While Harrison Ford gives an authenticity to good guy roles that many younger actors ca n't come close to , this is cliche-ridden , formulaic and predictable . Coming soon : Harrison Ford as a grandpa seeking revenge in Spam Blocker . For all its fleeting touches of color , Firewall 's main players are stranded in template land . Another Hollywood movie that presents a 'typical ' American family as ultra-privileged and glamorous . Harrison Ford is outshone by his costars in this crisp , conventional thriller . A generally uninspired script strains when it 's time to wrap things up . Both dutifully formulaic and brazen in its willingness exploit in-jeopardy elements just short of the horror-film threshold , such barriers might prevent audiences from savoring an otherwise old-fashioned thriller . As we watch Ford reprise his trademark mannerisms , we no longer enjoy the ring of familiarity . We just hear the tolling of a bell -- Ford 's . It 's a tricky thing , but an ideal thriller enables an audience to enjoy watching characters suffer . Here , that 's difficult . 	Harrison Ford 's rote performance brings little to this uninspired techno-heist film whose formulaic plot is befuddled with tedious and improbable twists .
1108799-score Mostly just went gaga over the three generations of extremely talented and 'method ' actors appearing on the screen at the same time . The script is only so-so but it has a terrific retro style , it 's well-directed and it makes an engrossing showcase for its trio of stars . Let down by a tepid script , plodding direction and -- amazingly , in view of the talent involved -- indifferent acting ; this is n't a winning 'Score . ' You could take the same cast and do another Killer Tomatoes sequel , and it would still be worthwhile to watch . Plays like a slow motion version of Entrapement with De Niro attempting a geriatric rendition of Catherine Zeta-Jones . A fun , simply directed heist picture that 's smart enough , darkly stylish enough and suspenseful enough to keep you very satisfied . A spiritless , unimaginative exercise in professionalism for its own sake . Witnessing De Niro , Norton , Brando and Bassett act in this film is like watching Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa play softball . You 're not sure why they 're doing it , but you would n't miss the game for anything . En efecto , se trata de una larga coleccin de clichs del gnero , pero el resultado es agradable y los dos estelares llenan la pantalla ... An extravagantly cast buddy movie , a summertime caper flick , peppered with a few thrills and many laughs . 	Though the movie treads familar ground in the heist/caper genre , DeNiro , Norton , and Brando make the movie worth watching .
1122382-spellbound These kids are all champs . An unpretentious classic of the form . Simple and ... pure . Blitz paints the spelling bee as an unusual incarnation of the American dream , one that combines the country 's veneration for drive and intelligence with its lust for competitive sports . First-time director Jeffrey Blitz makes the picture more than just a nerve-wracking competitive spectacle . He also turns the proceedings into a microcosm of America -- and in many respects , an essay on the American Dream . It might be spellbinding , but the theming of this indie documentary is mismanaged and it lacks a voice for its subject matter . My favorite contestant , April DeGideo , wears glasses and a perpetually serious expression , even when describing her oblivious parents as Archie and Edith Bunker . To use a word I know these kids can spell , Blitz 's Spellbound is spellbinding . Whether from a Texas ranch , a Missouri trailer park or a Washington , D.C. , housing project , these spellers define something unique about the American character . These determined , sometimes-obsessed kids stick with you , presenting a portrait of America as a melting pot unified in determination and a hefty serving of alphabet soup . 	A suspenseful , gripping documentary that features an engaging cross section of American children .
jack and jill 2011 Jack and Jill needs less Sandler , more Pacino . No matter how difficult or painful it might be , Adam Sandler 's closest friends really need to do the respectable and humane thing and sit him down for an intervention . How will future generations judge us for the huge box-office love we 've shown Adam Sandler over the years ? It is also typical in that it contains a lot of witless bathroom and ethnic humor ... If there was a drag queen pageant and Mrs. Doubtfire , Noxeema Jackson , Madea and Jill had to compete ( even the name , Jill , is bland ) , Miss Jill would get the axe before she graced the runway . Picture `` Tootsie '' if everyone in the cast had a head injury . That 's `` Jack and Jill . '' Forgive my stereotyping when I observe that most of the people who were laughing were also the same folks generous enough to share their cell phones . Even by sloppy Sandler movie standards , this one 's a wreck - fart jokes , potty zingers and pit-stain gags . Sandler 's drag act becomes so excruciatingly unpleasant that it inspires involuntary shudders and post-traumatic nightmares . In some parallel universe , hilarity ensues . 	Although it features an inexplicably committed performance from Al Pacino , Jack and Jill is impossible to recommend on any level whatsoever .
new york i love you Where 's the ethnic diversity ? The cultural overflow ? The dirt , the chaos , the cramped quarters , the people who look like us , rather than movie stars ? Even the more predictable prove pleasurable . Some films accumulate power as they go on . A film like New York , I Love You stops and starts without accruing much of anything . As with Paris , Je T'Aime , New York , I Love You works as both romance film and seductive travelogue , but some will find its 'arty ' posturing more maddening than magical . The result is a dinner of appetizers that are individually tasty , if not completely satisfying . If you 've got a heart of treacle , an attention span of 15 minutes and ca n't afford the air fare then there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours . You know that you are in a really bad omnibus film when it turns out that Brett Ratner 's contribution is actually one of the better ones on display . If nothing else , it brilliantly captures the moods and tempo of New York : its vibrant pulse , its energy , its ethnic diversity , its clamorous excitement . Any longtime Gothamite might have come up with New York stories more emblematic than the marginal ones offered here . A considerable effort by all has resulted in less than the sum of its parts 	Like many anthologies , New York , I Love You has problems of consistency , but it is n't without its moments .
skyfall A Bond film should feature a menacing villain who 's also just a touch daffy ; Javier Bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come-hither leer . It stands up with the finest work that Deakins has ever done , which pretty much means that it 's as gorgeous as film gets . Some of it is terrific . And some of it is spectacular . The best Bond film since the '60s . Period . Too often this martini is sloppy , not smooth . The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks . Guess what ? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks . Skyfall is not , of course , ''darker '' or more serious than previous Bond films , but it 's more knowing about its own conventions . Despite a lack of complexity , `` Skyfall '' is a respectable chapter in the Bond saga . Bond traditions have n't just been updated -- they 've been intelligently modified and rethought , giving us the franchise 's inherent pleasures in a new package . This is one of the 50-year-old series ' most exciting and commandingly compelling entries . Yes , James Bond is back to being James Bond . 	Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart , sexy , riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date .
standing in the shadows of motown The film 's energy is primarily due to the rich storytelling skills of the musicians , who trot out anecdotes and memories filled with humor and wry philosophizing . Scenes in which the band grooves with modern musicians Montell Jordan and Joan Osborne singing covers are spectacular . Some kind of peace of mind If you love the music , and I do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ... The film truly does rescue [ the Funk Brothers ] from Motown 's shadows . It 's about time . Like some of the poppier Hitsville U.S.A. songs , the film is a little too slick and a little too warm-and-fuzzy ... but it is always engrossing and enjoyable ... The Funk Brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat . Guaranteed to please even folks who normally avoid documentaries as avidly as Superman keeps clear of Kryptonite . Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . It 's a revelatory aural journey that gets you to hear something you 've always known without quite realizing it : that the magic of the Motown sound was , quite literally , its sound , which the Funk Brothers created . 	A toe-tapping tribute to the band that gave Motown its sound .
special It may not be perfect , but this under-the-radar indie from Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore is smart enough to leave you glad you found it . A beautiful metaphor for the desperate need to be important in a world where we rarely make personal connections any more , Special deserves to be seen . The sight of him , bloodied but eternally unbowed , in his ridiculous , homemade superhero costume may indeed be totally iconic for true pulp believers . Ultimately it adds little to our understanding of the curious return of the superhero as our paradigmatic pop archetype . Rappaport does a yeoman 's job in this tonally confused oddity . Rappaport 's befuddled sincerity has never registered so poignantly , but given its singular premise , for the film to waste an easy opportunity to satirize vigilante do-goodery and pharmaceutical dependence is , well , villainous . Genuinely original in parts but this works as a comedy only in places . A good narrative feature with elements of comedy and drama , giving character actor Michael Rapaport a chance to really shine in a complex lead role . Shot for pennies -- a cash limitation that benefits the production 's creativity and credibility -- this haunting film keeps shifting the ground under our feet Take [ s ] a page from the cartoonist Bill Watterson , who noted of the tiger protagonist in his great Calvin & Hobbes , 'The nature of [ the character 's ] reality does n't interest me , and each story goes out of its way to avoid resolving the issue . ' 	This quirky indie comedy 's low budget is readily apparent , but it 's elevated by Michael Rapaport 's dedicated performance .
cemetery junction Gervais and Merchant may offer less ambition or novelty than meet the eye , but being cosily shepherded to their feel-good destination never feels like drudgery . As filmmakers , Gervais and Merchant find a rhythm technically that makes the fact they never find the balance between humor and heart that they 've achieved in the past even more of a disappointment . A major disappointment , but not an entirely surprising one . Stylishly cinematic ode to the dreams of youth and the will to escape the shackles that so relentlessly conspire to trap us in everything that is most limiting about our lives Beware the comic creators who decide they want to be taken `` seriously . '' The period setting has been captured to a tee ; it 's all red bricks , ghastly wallpaper , casual racism and cut-glass fruitbowls . Everything is viewed through a haze of cigarette smoke . It 's little wonder the kids want out . There are huge tracts of ineloquent dialogue while we wonder where the film is going . This is a passable , mildly diverting , coming-of-age Brit-flick . Coming from the Gervais/Merchant stable though , it 's a frustrating let-down after past successes . Where Cemetery Junction 's strength lies is in its depiction of the relationship between three friends . Mean-spirited humour alternates with sentimental didacticism ; sitcom jostles with melodrama ; lazy shorthand is punctuated by explicitness . 	It fails to challenge the well-established conventions of its storyline , but Cemetery Junction benefits from the genuine warmth of its script , as well as its refusal to give in to cheap nostalgia .
art of the steal Calculated to enrage and pulling it off like gangbusters ... The film 's good versus bad scenario is , while understandable , too simplistic . Argott advances Wire creator David Simon 's art to offer a leaner , meaner template for complex investigative filmmaking . This insider look at art world shenanigans and politicking is both fascinating and scandalous . At times , The Art of the Steal is a bit too shocked by the vulgarity of commerce , but it 's memorable when it meditates on the changing face of where we look at art , and how that changes the art itself . A fascinating indictment of how legislation and politics can be abused in a way that quite literally misses the bigger picture . The gripping yet hyperbolic drama examines the ownership of art and the public 's right to it . ... A highly partisan and energetic documentary Don Argott 's absorbing documentary reveals the truth that mainstream Hollywood movies almost always hide from us : it frequently is n't just one villain screwing someone over , it takes a village . Is it really `` a tragedy '' that lots more people will get to see these paintings ? 	Deeply esoteric and unapologetically one-sided , The Art of the Steal proves a documentary does n't have to make an objective argument as long as it argues well .
prairie home companion Just lovely , and a magnificently enjoyable coda to an extraordinary career . In a world of hype , earthshaking and globe-threatening crises , and annoying celebrity excess , what a contrast , what a respite , what a blessing it is to seek refuge weekly in A Prairie Home Companion ! An Almanesque outburst of musical joy . Life is fleeting , but A Prairie Home Companion , slender and perfect , proves that art endures as a reminder of it An uneven yarn of pregnant pauses punctuated by charm . A Prairie Home Companion glides along effortlessly offering some sweet sentiment , loads of gentle laughs and some great little musical moments . Robert Altman might be 81 years old , but damn he still knows how to direct a big cast of characters in an entertaining movie . It 's a tribute to music 's power to heal us , to the way a familiar tune brings a comfortable old-shoe smile and the way a group sing-along bonds those within it , creating a community in that moment . It 's often those small , tossaway moments - Keillor reviewing script unabashed in his underpants , Streep cheekily yipping extra 'ees ' out of a sung 'prairie , ' that make it special . The world 's tallest shy comedian floats out of the radio with a power cast that even Altman is challenged to harness . 	The final film by the great Robert Altman , A Prairie Home Companion , the big screen adaptation of Garrison Keillor 's radio broadcast , showcases plenty of the director 's strengths : it 's got a gigantic cast and plenty of quirky acting and dialogue . Much like the radio show , Companion features clever jokes , rousing tunes , and endearing characters . With strong work from Lindsay Lohan , Meryl Streep , Kevin Kline , and Tommy Lee Jones , it 's a worthy swan song from one of the cinema 's best .
innerspace a lame , SF proving Martin Short is no movie star For all the Amblin technology on display , Dante 's greatest effects are humanistic Innerspace is significant for one thing -- the establishment of Martin Short as the funniest new kid on the Hollywood block . Too bad that 's not enough for the sensation-a-second makers of Innerspace . I loved it at 14 years old . I was mildly amused 14 years later . Make of that what you will . Here is an absurd , unwieldy , overplotted movie that nevertheless is entertaining - and some of the fun comes from the way the plot keeps laying it on . It 's an easy-to-get-along-with movie -- bouncy , rabbity fun . An underrated comic masterpiece from the talented director Joe Dante . It 's good to have friends on the inside , you know ? Fun is to be had , but not too memorable in retrospect . Aventura de fico cientfica que , com o toque amalucado de Joe Dante , vira uma comdia quase besteirol - alis , em alguns momentos vai at longe demais . No entanto , os efeitos so bacanas , o esprito de diverso e o filme agrada . 	A manic , overstuffed blend of sci-fi , comedy , and romance , Innerspace nonetheless charms , thanks to Martin Short 's fine performance and the insistent zaniness of the plot .
what we do in the shadows Where this documentary shines is that it creates empathy for its subjects . It 's not their fault that they were bitten centuries ago . They 're just trying to make the best of the situation . The funniest mockumentary film since Best In Show . The New Zealand-made art comedy What We Do in the Shadows is a bracing reminder of how the right burst of energy and style breathes fresh ideas into a genre threatened with creative exhaustion . What We Do in the Shadows breathes new life into both the mock doc and horror spoof genres , two formats that have long been thought -- creatively anyway -- dead . Taps a fresh vein of humor to transfuse the horrific and the mundane . What We Do in the Shadows is more clever than it has any right to be . That 's really Clement and Waititi 's core joke : These neck-biters have been at it so long that they 're only imitating old vampire stereotypes . Like a lost Hammer horror film from the seventies , only intentionally funny . The tone -- deadpan , wistful , silly but never stupid -- is just right and puts `` What We Do in the Shadows '' next to `` This Is Spinal Tap '' as a mockumentary that shows its subjects as human -- in this case , inhuman -- in their hopes and fears . Any movie that makes you laugh this hard ( even if only sporadically ) deserves the shower of praise that 's been heaped upon it . 	Smarter , fresher , and funnier than a modern vampire movie has any right to be , What We Do in the Shadows is bloody good fun .
top gun Basically perfect , even it is perfect at one of the worst sorts of things a movie can attempt . You can argue that it 's a cool movie , but is `` Top Gun '' a good movie ? I 'd definitely say `` Hell no , '' topped with `` Are you kidding me ? '' Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact , but Scott does n't display the slightest bit of interest ( or belief ) in the actual characters and situations . You get about thirty minutes of good movie in Top Gun , and most of that comes at the end . A movie for adolescents , and adults who willfully decide not to know better for a couple of hours . [ Blu-Ray ] If you missed it in theaters the first time , it 's probably going to be the best movie theater experience you 'll have so far this year . An undeniably cheesy yet strangely appealing time capsule , with a little something for everyone provided we understand that it 's all bubblegum . The story is risible , the direction routine , the underlying ethic highly questionable ; but the flying stirs the blood like speed . Watchable but rarely enthralling ... Top Gun is the type of movie that turns the screen into an altar . Kneeling before its slick faade of 1980s magnificence , you are in the shadow of a film that has defined the modern day action blockbuster . 	Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aereial footage shot with an expert eye for action , Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters are n't in the air .
life as a house It says that relationships - like houses - need to be built . Damn man , who knew that watching a movie about people building a house would be so powerful ! ? Good stuff . The difference between the house and the film is that the house is brought to completion in satisfying fashion . The film is n't . One half-step shy of schmaltzy , but relentlessly heartbreaking . Highly polished and impressive in every way except that it has a synthetic heart and mush for brains . For a movie that 's all about embracing life wholeheartedly , Life as a House sure does a good job of keeping its actors in check . Elevated beyond its cutesy contrivances and mawkishness by some extraordinarily good performances . Nuanced characterizations by stellar performers Achieves an intimacy rarely seen in a star-laden Hollywood drama . Remember the movie Terms of Endearment , about a mother-daughter relationship , a terminal illness and a message about not taking people for granted ? 	A manipulative tearjerker , Life as a House benefits from fine performances from the cast .
10004209-tristan and isolde [ `` Tristan & Isolde '' ] is trying to be both chick flick and machismo movie . I 'm not sure it does either well enough but it is a showcase for Sophia Myles . The end result plays out like a George Lucas film without spaceships and lightsabers . Sorry , no magic here . [ Director Reynolds ] has a feel for the rough beauty of western England and the Irish coast , and he moves quickly , if not always coherently , through battles and cabals . [ Tristan and Isolde ] moves so sluggishly that someone must have been dosing the cast and crew with Nyquil . With a bizarre coiffure that makes him look like the lead singer of an '80s New Wave band , Franco flares his nostrils and pouts -- his performance riddled with so many Anakin-ims you 'll think he 's auditioning for The Hayden Christensen Story . It 's a nice attempt to tell a classic love story with integrity , but the execution falters , leaving the true power of the romance lacking when the film needs it the most . one of those rare cinematic experiences that feels whole , that feels authentic . It has action and intrigue , diabolic plots , a tournament of champions , and everything else you would expect from a medieval movie , but it has a tendency to over tell the story and needs more romance . Tristan has its slightly silly moments , but rather like those fondly remembered epics of Hollywood past , its energy and entertainment value carry the day . 	Competent but somewhat static , Tristan & Isolde does n't achieve the sweeping romanticism that it aims for .
bugsy classy and fascinating Bugsy moves with a lightness that belies its strength . It is a movie that vibrates with optimism and passion , with the exuberance of the con-man on his game . A first-rate production from top to bottom ... Beatty has never been more electrifying on screen . An absorbing narrative flow and a parade of colorful underworld characters vie for screen time with an unsatisfactory central romance . While Bugsy expertly captures the glamor of '40s Hollywood , it fails as the drama of a man whose dreams of glory lure him to an ignominious end . There 's much fun to be had at Bugsy , if elegance , precision , and energy are enough to satisfy your tastes . A great deal of the fun of watching this very assured film is seeing with what energetic panache the actor takes on the mantle of the mobster J. Edgar Hoover once called `` the most dangerous man in America . '' More than just another gangster film , Bugsy is a compelling portrait of an ill-fated romance between two selfish , volatile people who stop at nothing to get what they want . And they want it when they want it . Bugsy Siegel is a fascinating character . Savvy crooks are engaging 	Stylishly scattered , Bugsy offers cinematic homage to the infamous underworld legend , chiefly through a magnetic performance from Warren Beatty in the title role .
boy in the striped pajamas ... a serious and well-made film that does the only moral thing a movie can do when it attempts to confront great evil - it nips off a human-size chunk and does n't flinch when the horror turns and bares its bloody , brazen maw . Only in the last 10 minutes does it get to grips with the full horror of the Holocaust , and that saves it from a Disneyish propensity not to shock us too much or impose a feelgood ending . Young Scanlon and Butterfield are scathingly effective , never overplaying their roles . One of those films one has to admire for what it 's attempting , even if it does n't quite succeed in achieving it . The tropes of the heartwarming indie kids movie get thrown together with the tropes of the low-voltage , war-at-home war drama , and the result is muddled but undeniably affecting Tries so hard to achieve ironic detachment from its subject matter that it 's unlikely to connect with anyone moved by Life Is Beautiful . Sophisticated and involving , The Boy in the Striped Pajamas offers a fuller picture of the period [ than the book ] and a stunner of a conclusion . Boy in the Striped Pajamas is morally defensible , but very hard to watch . That these boys could not fathom what was actually going on in the camps also rings true and is the reason why stories like this one must endure . In no way a fashion statement about sleepwear , but rather a solemnly imaginative political statement about the Germans asleep when it came to exactly what was going down during the Nazi regime . The Final Solution meets The Pied Piper . 	A touching and haunting family film that deals with the Holocaust in an arresting and unusual manner , and packs a brutal final punch of a twist .
1207523-obsessed Obsessed takes far too long to get cooking , and it works so hard at not being exploitation that it loses sight of its reasons for existing in the first place . Beyonce 's latest movie contains more laughs than the entire output of Jim Carrey , Will Ferrell and Eddie Murphy . Just one problem - Obsessed is meant to be a thriller . Do n't look for hot sex or boiled bunnies in Obsessed , a mild-mannered version of Fatal Attraction that seems to be hoping racial politics will fill in for a script . It 's strictly a generic thriller , perhaps the 105th blatant rip-off of 'Fatal Attraction ' , but not without its own guilty pleasures . As far as the crazy-stalker-chick genre goes , Obsessed is n't horrible . It 's just intensely simple-minded . Too `` safe '' to be a provocative thriller or an incendiary drama , and it 's way too flat and sedate to qualify as a movie bad enough to mock . It 's execrable ; a fist-chewing embarrassment that has no right to a theatrical release . Obsessed delivers in its limited way , as the audience audibly responds to the characters ' choices and actions , even though we know exactly what to expect . You would be better served by simply watching the video for the Beyonce-Shakira duet `` Beautiful Liar '' -- not only does it do a better job of conveying the same basic story seen here , the choreography is a lot better . a grandly sensational , relentlessly exploitative B-movie revival of the highest order 	The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside , Obsessed is a generic , toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable .
flight of the navigator One for the none too discerning youngster . If there is more than a little something borrowed from Spielberg , Kleiser 's movie is amiably undemanding entertainment that says the right things , albeit without great originality . There 's no mistaking Flight of the Navigator for a really first-rate children 's picture like , say , The Black Stallion . But Flight of the Navigator is an enjoyable film that encourages kids to use their heads . The early CG FX have aged remarkably well , while the slow build-up makes the Spielbergian space adventure all the more fantastic . At times a bit too precious , especially inside the young navigator 's spacecraft , but the warm regard for character , as well as for our often-inhospitable planetary home , makes for a reasonably good time . Weirdly entertaining kiddie space adventure . Whereas its plot may be derivative -- and at several junctures , unconvincing -- '' Flight of the Navigator '' nevertheless manages to develop considerable humor and poignancy from David 's predicament and what he does about it . Flight of the Navigator , in spite of a rough beginning , soars as it should , taking a child on the journey of his life . An exciting time travel adventure . Not a particularly original or insightful film of its kind , and marred slightly by the whining of Cramer in the lead role , this is nevertheless enjoyable fare for kids . 	Bolstered by impressive special effects and a charming performance from its young star , Flight of the Navigator holds up as a solidly entertaining bit of family-friendly sci-fi .
festival express Both drive-thru snapshot travelogue of nomad alternative culture , and one-of-a-kind caught moments of intimate jam sessions . A clever look at the period , even if it does slightly sidestep the politics . Joplin lends Festival Express the raw gravitas that pushes the doc into the realm of near-greatness . A very well-assembled piece . Although their on-board antics are mighty entertaining , it 's the extraordinary performances -- including Joplin 's historic , heart-rending 'Cry Baby ' -- that lift this movie into the cannon of classic festival films . A delirious piece of pop ephemera , a time capsule set on the cusp between the Summer of Love and the Day the Music Died . This is the film 's most interesting angle : the tension that arises as rabble-rousers fight with cops and rail against the promoters who dared to charge $ 16 for a daylong concert . A bittersweet and haunting tribute to that tumultuous -- yet glorious -- adventure across Canada . This is the filmed fun of musicians enjoying what they do . It 's a fun , 90-minute ride , if little more . 	Festival Express is a spellbinding documentary that nostalgically chronicles five days in the summer of 1970 , when a train full of now- legendary rock perfomers jammed its way across Canada .
joneses The film 's fatal flaw is Borte 's refusal to give his satire the darker , uncomfortable edge it needs to give his lesson some impact . Writer-director Derrick Borte takes this somewhat clever concept and turns it into a muddled mix of weak social commentary , predictable drama and wan comedy . Sharp-edged ... a smart comedy with an agenda that , for the most part , knows what it 's about and gets about it . It 's not perfect but it 's full of surprises . Writer-director Derrick Borte makes an impressive film debut that takes advantage of a familiarity with marketing consumer goods and seductive advertising . It 's a brilliant premise but wretchedly executed , as product placement becomes more important than the sly inherent satire of consumer conformity . Mr. Borte conjures up a pleasant Stepford that runs less on robotic conformity than on endless , anxious competition . The key to the film is that it allows this life to have some real appeal . A high-concept premise too-tidily comments on its underlying subject matter in The Joneses . The premise of this social satire is so enjoyable you keep trying to believe it even though it makes no sense Making good use of its excellent premise , this flawed gem deserves to find an audience . Moore looks fabulous in a role that plays to her strengths as a feisty , independent woman , and she generates on-screen heat with Duchovny to make the conventional happy ending easier to swallow . 	It does n't pursue its subversive premise as far as it should , but The Joneses benefits from its timely satire of consumer culture -- as well as a pair of strong performances from David Duchovny and Demi Moore .
1072107-matilda Not awful and certainly not great , Matilda is a strange little flick , but that 's not to say your 9-year-old daughter wo n't get a solid kick out of it . DeVito gleefully preserves Dahl 's dark comic tone , which should delight both kids and parents . With her sweet-sad face , Mara Wilson is a perfect Matilda . Offbeat fantasy gem , but too dark for young kids . Dark , beautiful adaptation of Roald Dahl story is uncompromising , entertaining and moving . Slick kids movie that preserves Roald Dahl 's gleeful nastiness . The adult performers fare considerably better than the young lead in this faithful adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic . 	Danny DeVito-directed version of Matilda is odd , charming , and while the movie diverges from Roald Dahl , it nonetheless captures the book 's spirit .
birthday girl A disposable film . ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . Despite its lopsided plot , the movie has more than enough unconventional moments and solid laughs to qualify as one of the year 's sleepers . A deceptively clever romantic comedy that is also part caper , part thriller and a perfect vehicle for both Ms. Kidman and her talented co-star , Ben Chaplin . Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . For a supposedly fast-moving thriller -- and a movie that takes only 93 minutes -- Birthday Girl is surprisingly sluggish . An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . It 's all over the road -- sometimes farce , sometimes horror , sometimes thriller , sometimes police procedural . And the truth is , no one in it is particularly sympathetic . An ineffective romance , a monotonous thriller , and a decidedly banal crime picture . Keep your eye on Kidman , whose kinky , kittenish performance turns unexpected emotional corners that pull you up short . 	Kidman shows her range in this quirky movie , but the shift in tone from romantic comedy to thriller may leave viewers unsatisfied .
thirteen days A genuinely gripping look at just how little control of events America 's leaders had when the ultimate nightmare scenario almost became reality . Wins an undeservedly high interest level because of what it covers , not how well it covers it . The DVD has some interesting special features with the best being the director talking about the deleted scenes and exactly why they were cut . Thoroughly gripping . A vision that will leave you stirred in these days of well-justified cynicism . So who says 13 is unlucky ? People will be watching Thirteen Days long after journalism 's junkyard dogs have gone snapping after other prey . engaging power play of politics and military muscling . An unblinking chronicle of the world on the eve of destruction . Perhaps the most human depiction of Jack and Bobby we 've ever seen . 	Thirteen Days offers a compelling look at the Cuban Missile Crisis , and its talented cast deftly portrays the real-life people who were involved .
emperors new groove For some reason , this film feels rushed through , like the conventional animation pictures are becoming a kind of filler between the computer-animated Pixar releases . Will the kids buy it ? You bet they will . It 's got consistently witty writing , engaging characters , inspired voice acting , jazzy animation and a strong message of brotherly love all wrapped up in a family-friendly bow . Warburton creates one of the truly most memorable Disney characters in the seemingly dimwitted Kronk . As Disney animated films go this is not the best , but definitely not the worst . A zany tonic , more upbeat and funnier than the lugubrious Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . Neither the best nor the most endearing of Disney , but it 's a sassy amusement . And nicely short . You may not love it , but this jolly llama is still , for the most part , a pleasant diversion . Yawn ! This Disney comedy makes a self-conscious and largely successful attempt to modernise the studio 's format with a jive-ass sensibility . 	The Emperor 's New Groove is n't the most ambitious animated film , but its brisk pace , fresh characters , and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family .
1097865-gone in 60 seconds Slow this movie down long enough for people to get up to buy popcorn , and they might change their minds and go straight home . A moderately enjoyable action movie that seriously overstays its welcome . Gone in 60 Seconds does have its moments , but they last about as long as the title implies . Has the energy of a dead battery . This is another one of those films that fits into the `` it is what it is '' category , only it 's better than that . It is what it is and does it really , really well . Much of the film is below even Bruckheimer 's usual popcorn-munching standards . It collapses into a heap of ridiculously over-the-top stunts , movie cliches and surprisingly sappy dialog . Gone in 60 Seconds , in fact , might even stimulate some in the audience to ask about the movie world , 'Is that all there is ? ' Depending on how you take your action , Gone in 60 Seconds , is either a triumph of ultra-slick silliness ... or a head-scratching attempt to jack wallets with the finesse these characters use on cars . Those who prefer Nicolas Cage in soulful roles may not be attracted to Gone in 60 Seconds 	Even though Oscar-bearers Nicolas Cage , Angelina Jolie , and Robert Duval came aboard for this project , the quality of Gone in 60 Seconds is disappointingly low . The plot line is nonsensical , and even the promised car-chase scenes are boring .
american dreamz ... American Dreamz is kind of all over the place from the beginning . Many of us have an American Dream : to go to the movies and laugh . The new comedy American Dreamz will fulfill that fantasy for some people . Most of American Dreamz has a curiously dated , been-there feel : It 's a redundant comedy , like hearing the same tired joke for the 100th time . American Dreamz tries hard to be both important and farcical , but it leans a bit too much towards farce without being funny enough to pull that off either . It 's decent , but uninspired . 20 years from now , Dreamz will be a fine time capsule of who we are , and of everything that we think is 'so cool . ' It 's not really a cynical or outrageous point of view , but just a really lazy one , and offensively , exploitatively so . the appeal of the movie so disintegrates with every second of resolution that I found myself hating it by the ending credits What 's interesting about the movie is that , while it 's only moderately funny , it 's extremely amusing ... It held my interest throughout . For all its misguided qualities , the movie is at least perfectly cast . The entire cast -- including Dennis Quaid and Mandy Moore -- is pitch-perfect , nailing hilarious one-liners with shades of irony . 	This overly silly satire aims at too many targets with arrows too dull to make relevant social commentary .
sorority row this splatfest is exactly the type of movie it should be . disastrous In a generation , Carrie Fisher has moved from Jabba the Hut to a job at the Pizza Hut - with plenty of extra cheese . Glossy , gorgeous to look at and filled with 'jump'-in-your-seat moments , this has all the hallmarks of a popcorn horror movie , complete with the ubiquitous shower scene , creepy abandoned cellars and characters ' humorous nods to their own stupidity . The combination of gore and giggles can work . But where Scream was funny and knowing and peppered with genuine scares , Sorority Row seems happy merely to play dumb and make a joke of its own derivativeness . Mean Girls meets I Know What You Did Last Summer ... You wo n't be able to scream for laughing at this sloppy reimagining of a forgotten '80s slasher thriller . Over 100 long minutes , as each is murdered by an unseen assailant , the movie 's job is to draw empathy from the audience for its harem of harridans . It does n't work . The `` scary '' moments are of the sneak-up-on-you-from-behind variety , but there 's little suspense . Simultaneously knowing and clueless , the script has the try-hard feel of someone attempting to update the savage teen talk of Heathers , while the plot unfurls as if Scream never happened . It seems to be the most original slasher movie of the year , quite a fete considering it 's a remake . 	Though it 's slick and stylish , Sorority Row offers nothing new to the slasher genre and misses the mark both in its attempts at humor and thrills .
talented mr ripley We all knew Damon was a fine actor after Good Will Hunting , but The Talented Mr. Ripley takes him much further much faster than anyone could have expected . The best Alfred Hitchcock movie made since Alfred Hitchcock died . A `` 10 Best '' achievement , thanks to writer-director Anthony Minghella 's acute interpretation of Patricia Highsmith 's novel , a shooting style that wallows in decadence and danger , and a choice cast completely in sync with the stringent demands of the story . Ripley morphs into a well-meaning kid who yearns to be somebody . He 's deprived , not depraved . You will walk out of [ Ripley ] unsure of your feelings about young Tom . You can be outraged by his lack of morality and shocked by his behavior , but deep down -- in that dark place only you can see -- you may find a spark of admiration . Matt Damon is simply not convincing in this role . Not only is his performance flat , but he is unable to generate any sense of menace . A cast with unusual depth . The Talented Mr. Ripley offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look . The cast , particularly Law and Hoffman , turn in salary-raising performances . The film successfully transmits the lifestyle Tom longs for , as a result of the better-defined character of Dickie , and of the desirability the actor Jude Law effectively projects . 	With Matt Damon 's unsettling performance offering a darkly twisted counterpoint to Anthony Minghella 's glossy direction , The Talented Mr. Ripley is a suspense thriller that lingers .
1194524-high school musical 3 senior year It 's hard to complain about a pop culture phenomenon built on unabashed innocence . It 's well made and entirely watchable , but it wo n't really appeal to anyone outside its target audience . They sing . They dance . And they smooch a little . But not too much . After all , this is a G-rated Disney extravaganza . High School Musical 3 overstays its welcome , stretching out about 20 minutes longer than it needs to , thanks chiefly to a final celebratory reel that simply refuses to end . The HSM series has always been playful and high-spirited , with a refreshing emphasis on collective action and the importance of group effort over the individual , and there 's nothing in High School Musical 3 : Senior Year to upset the formula . A generous , upbeat film that provides lively , unthreatening entertainment for young viewers ... This film has the exact same tone and flavor of its predecessors . I am a 24 year old guy who loves action movies and raunchy comedies but even I can admit the songs in this film were catchy . The film is cliched but clearly for kids to stare at Zac Efron . HSM3 is eminently watchable , occasionally very funny , and sweet enough to give you diabetes . I 'm glad I did n't pay full price to see this , but it is not a bad way to pass some time in a bargain theater or a cheap movie rental . 	It wo n't win many converts , but High School Musical 3 is bright , energetic , and well-crafted .
the lives of others The Lives of Others is a supremely intelligent , unfailingly honest look at a shadowy period in recent German history . A stunning , even electrifying view of communism in EastGermany as a soulless regime . The Lives of Others is a powerful but quiet film , constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires . Writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is a master of tone and place . Un film sur le courage et la dtermination en temps de crise comme on aimerait en voir plus souvent . a finely nuanced screenplay into whose naturalistic dialogue an intricate array of suggestive symbols and recurring motifs are subtly folded . The scope is especially impressive given that the movie is about a society obsessively focused on the tiniest of details . A potent narrative about the transformative effect of involvement in other people 's stories , Lives turns its own story into a python-tight embrace of nuanced tension and emotional connection . If the filmmaker commits a crime , it 's in pushing the [ Stasi ] character 's rehabilitation slightly too far -- about as much as the weight of a teardrop . Pan 's Labyrinth deserved to win the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar , of course , but the Academy 's selection of The Lives of Others hardly qualifies as an outrage . 	Unlike more traditional spy films , The Lives of Others does n't sacrifice character for cloak and dagger chases , and the performances ( notably that by the late Ulrich Muhe ) stay with you .
bulworth As writer , director and star , Beatty flails all over the screen , but he 's also made the only recent political satire that draws blood . Warren Beatty 's brave , if ramshackle , political farce tackles the dirty business of racial inequality and corporate greed with the tenacity of a pit bull . Besides its intriguing political agenda , Bulworth is packed with good performances . What begins as a promising , potentially brilliant political satire fast degenerates into yet another celebrity soapbox ... ... Bulworth is the product of an interesting engaged intelligence operating at or near peak capacity Bulworth is an angry movie , but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize that people respond better to comedies than serious `` issue films , '' so he has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original , incisive satire . sometimes ambitious failures are more interesting to watch than modest successes , and , though `` Bulworth '' may offend ... it 's unlikely to bore anyone . Bulworth 's broadsides are n't nearly as shocking as they 're supposed to be Extraordinarily well written and performed , Bulworth is simply brilliant . Warren Beatty makes interesting films . No question . And Bulworth is perhaps his most complete . 	Star and director Beatty 's ambitious take on race and politics in 20th-century America is n't perfect , but manages to provide more than its share of thought-provoking laughs .
delicatessen This is a film for particularly morbid tastes in comedy . visually astonishing An auspicious debut for Jeunet that tends to be overly praised , but is definitely worth seeing . Like a light-hearted Brazil it conjures up imagery of such impact , and such resonant subject matter that it will ( ... ) affect audiences for generations to come . Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro made a brilliant feature film debut with this bizarre and visually stunning comedy about cannibalism . Its content is wholly original . Sublime , edible film with exquisite art direction . Delicatessen uses its aggressive stylization and capricious visual contraptions as a form of imprisonment . A fair bet for cultdom , a lot more likeable than its subject matter suggests , and simply essential viewing for vegetarians . Delicatessen is a fearsomely intense movie that mixes moods with formidable assurance . 	Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet deftly combines horror , sci-fi , and humor in Delicatessen , a morbid comedy set in a visually ravishing futuristic dystopia .
exit through the gift shop ... offers 90 minutes of pretty good entertainment . The fact that it may well be just one more stunt by an artist known for stunts does n't detract in the least from the enjoyment . Too ironic by half , this film is hobbled most of all by principal Thierry Guetta , that I find insufferably banal . As a satire on a market-driven art world , it is fairly toothless . Why it has garnered rave reviews is the biggest puzzle of all . Is Exit Through the Gift Shop a real documentary or an expert hoax ? Does it really matter as long as you 're laughing and thinking ? The only thing that may keep `` Exit Through the Gift Shop '' from winning the Oscar next year for best documentary is that it may be totally untrue . Aside from that , it 's a shoo-in . The picture adapts a provocative conceit , one that melds its formal construction with the ideas at its core . An irritatingly misguided and pointless piece of work ... Banksy 's debut film is poignant without pretentiousness . This is a deadpan-rollicking film , helped by fizzy editing and funky visuals . The behind-the-scenes insight into the techniques of illegal street art is fascinating , as is the art-market critique.. Curious docu about street artists with some strong language . 	An amusing , engrossing look at underground art , Exit Through the Gift Shop entertains as it deflates the myths and hype surrounding its subjects .
cidade dos homens Some might perceive City of Men as a slow film , while others could reasonably argue that Morelli is taking more time to develop characters . Violence is the overwhelming and viscerally unsettling theme ... but the story 's subtext is the paternal absence that leads kids to such aggression , not unlike less-developed Hollywood fare . Both Silva and Cunha ( who reprise their roles from the television show ) do make compelling leads and their performances add needed weight and shadings to their underwritten characters . Shot in a gritty , kinetic style that captures the colorful squalor of a neighborhood dubbed Dead-End Hill , City of Men is in many ways a more satisfying piece of storytelling than City of God . City of Men is a nerve-racking , strangely beautiful story that balances ambiguity in one hand and hope in the other . Performances are up to par , but the story unfolds conventionally -- it lacks the fragmented fury of its predecessor . You might call it City of God Lite . There are moments in City of Men that feel so vividly accurate that you may find yourself ducking from the gunfire . A must for fans of the TV series , as it continues the unique formula of mixing fun , fantasy , fear , and frankness , for 2 young men barely surviving to adulthood together . City Of Men has its share of problems , but being too entertaining is n't one of them . The film is n't bad by any means , but after God 's adrenaline-shots-to-the-heart rush , the laid-back storytelling comes off as a little sleepy . City of Men has the electrically oversaturated style of reality that made City of God such a searing vision of teenage criminal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro . 	Brutal and unflinching , City of Men is both a harrowing look at Brazil 's favela life , and a touching tale of youths rushed into adulthood .
brick ... an inspired time-warped teenage film noir . The picture gains in finesse and confidence to the point where Johnson more or less pulls off his peril-fraught exercise . A spoof would have been easy . Instead , Johnson plunges off the deep end , risking ridicule by shaping this spellbinder with grit and gravitas . the school 's cliques , cants and `` class '' politics are shown to be as amoral and impenetrable as any criminal netherworld dreamt up by Raymond Chandler . This glorified student film is only barely elevated by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan Frye a noir-speaking California high school misfit caught in the violent middle of a drug gang responsible for the death of his ex-girlfriend ( Emilie de Ra The freshest take on the genre since Reservoir Dogs . Never really offers an adequate justification for its central genre-transplant conceit . Brick 's low-key , post-modern approach ( indie-film euphemism for on-the-cheap ) mingles '40s and '50s costume accents with the institutional drab of a suburban high school . Brick would be better with a bit more Lynch in its soul , but Johnson is his own man , and I look forward to what he comes up with next . Things are played hard and fast and mean and lean ... [ Levitt 's ] dogged , world-weary demeanor does the old-time gumshoes proud . So does this weird , glorious freak of a movie . 	This entertaining homage to noirs past has been slickly and compellingly updated to a contemporary high school setting .
the conspirator Slow and emotionally sterile . The characters objectives and motives ? Not a clue . Redford guides the film with the heaviest of hands , inserting over-dramatic visual cues at every turn , and reserving the clumsiest manipulations for the labored allegory of the film 's obvious post-9/11 subtexts . A fascinating piece of history gets buried in the telling of this rather turgid courtroom drama that explores issues of principle , justice and protecting the rights of the innocent The film lacks the nerve to come to terms with the complexities its subject raises . It works on every level as an engaging drama with high stakes It 's just dull from beginning to end . And that 's a surprise ; `` dull '' is n't a term I 'd usually use to describe Redford 's work . In the context of a social studies class , The Conspirator would make for a fascinating , informative two hours ; on the big screen , it just feels like , well , a social studies class . If nothing else , this is certain to have a long life playing in middle school history classes for decades to come . It 's hard not to like McAvoy , with his glancing nervous energy , but The Conspirator rarely permits him to be anything except likable , and the script smooths out any wrinkles in the figure of Aiken . From the hurried opening that details the events on the night of the assassination to the arguments and counter-arguments of the courtroom procedural , The Conspirator rarely welcomes the viewer into its activities . 	The Conspirator is well cast and tells a worthy story , but many viewers will lack the patience for Redford 's deliberate , stagebound approach .
bowling for columbine No one would ever mistake Moore for anything but a mudslinging yellow journalist , but sometimes extreme issues require extreme measures . Moore sees a nation that extols the glories of 'family values ' while millions line up to see 'Jackass : The Movie ' ... With 'Bowling for Columbine , ' Michael Moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . A sweeping , sometimes insightful and often funny look at America 's culture of violence . [ Moore ] gets at vital issues the way no one else seems able to . The most thought-provoking film of the year , one that whipsaws you from laughs to tears to outrage . Master movie muckraker Moore retraces the final days of the Columbine shooters , in an alternately sordid and absurd trail that ends up encompassing a culpable media and a wacky gun love culture . The food for thought that Moore feeds us is still potent stuff Impressively reframes the gun-control debate in terms that advocates of both sides might find fruitful , but Moore does n't do anything to shed his reputation as a snot . A lot of this is amusing and somehow telling . But what does it all add up to ? 	Though it may not always convince , Bowling for Columbine asks important questions and provokes thought .
your friends and neighbors The perfect antidote for anyone considering cheating on his or her partner . It 's both a daring composition and a repelling look at gender warfare . The film 's star is LaBute , a genuine modern movie auteur who ventures behind the tantalizing blurbs on the covers of those trendy men 's and women 's magazines to find miserable , unhappy people . The web of lies , failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff , and it 's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners . The uneasiness and ambivalence the men and women in this drama experience with each other reflects the continuing sexual wars in society at large . I would n't recommend it as a date movie ! The tension between the fantasy of satisfaction and the reality of desolation poses an enthralling dramatic situation . The mood is often more coarse , crude , and nasty than needed to make [ LaBute 's ] cautionary points and also by that 'distancing effect , ' which diminishes whatever feelings of empathy or sympathy the story might otherwise inspire in its audience . LaBute 's characters are just cold , pretty figures striking art film poses while spouting corrosive but predictably theatrical dialogues . A fascinatingly mean-spirited erotic comedy set in a realm of self-absorbed fantasy and overdetermined intergender misunderstanding . 	Though it may strike some viewers as cold and unpleasant , Neil LaBute 's Your Friends & Neighbors is an incisive critique of sexual politics wrapped up in a scathing black comedy .
white It 's often cruel , of course , and cool as an ice-pick , but it 's still endowed with enough unsentimental humanity to end with a touching , lyrical admission of the power of love . Essential viewing . A continuing testament to the Polish director 's poetic mastery . A delightfully wry dark comedy . In White , which details the agonies of obsessive love , [ Kieslowski 's ] story is more realistic , and his style more prosaic , but the results are no less inscrutable -- and no less engaging . an odd seriocomic film Kieslowski presents a character who seeks superiority rather than equality and in a capitalist society he achieves it . As probing and meaningful as any arthouse hit of the '90s , lacking only the drama and mystical qualities of Blue and Red to overtly flag itself as such . Funny with a great tinge of irony . White is full of interesting ideas , more than ten average films put together , but they 're just not executed all that smoothly . Bookended as it is by Blue and Red , the second film in Kieslowski 's liberty/ equality/ fraternity trilogy is a welcome relief from the sometimes tragic sensibility of the other two films . 	Taking a lighter tone than the other films of the Three Colors trilogy , White is a witty , bittersweet comedy with heavier themes on its mind than one might at first realize .
tomorrow when the war began Action-packed and thrilling to the max but TWTWB is let down by its inexperienced cast and surprisingly clunky dialogue . Despite some effective moments , the film does n't begin to compare with Milius 's highly sophisticated rightwing movie that gives the Soviet and Cuban invaders their due . Beattie has made a rousing directorial debut that could and should become a monster international hit . Marsden has written a further nine books about Ellie 's exploits : bring them on as films , I say . a nice combination of high school angst and blockbuster action Just fast-moving fun , enough so to gloss over its shortcomings . Although it 's bookended by some stilted dialogue and inappropriately upbeat end credits , the film gets the important things right : explosions and emotional resonance . The dialogue is cheesy but I was impressed by the tension that builds throughout the film . This has a stand-out , star-making performance from Neighbours ' Caitlin Stasey - if only she did n't always emerge from battle looking as if she 'd just stepped out of a L'Oral advert . American audiences might prefer to see their own country being invaded by Asiatic hordes on the big screen , but Tomorrow , When the War Began is as glossy and slick as any Hollywood production . . . Tomorrow , When the War Began works best when none of the cast is talking . 	While the script is n't amazing and the story 's race issues linger , this adaptation of John Marsden 's book is an exciting , action-heavy adventure that should please fans of the series .
gigantic The flabby , fawning film Gigantic comes across as 102 minutes of rib-nudging by one of the duo 's annoyingly self-satisfied connoisseurs . The Giants ' longevity flows from the fact that they ca n't be explained , only experienced . Gigantic accomplishes something very difficult : It makes you feel like part of a club even if you are n't . A gift for those already in the fold , for those who get the joke and just want to savor it with other like-minded fans . recalls `` The Compleat Beatles '' in its ability to show a band 's evolution artistically and historically The history is what makes the film enjoyable . AJ Schnack 's delightful documentary on the askew duo captures their appeal so well that you could walk in knowing nothing about them and emerge a die-hard fan . The movie provides nearly as much pleasure as a greatest-hits CD -- although not quite as much as hearing 'Do n't Let 's Start ' for the very first time . Prepare yourself for nights wandering around the house singing unshakable tunes . As a film , Gigantic is excessive and poorly structured . 	A clever , absorbing documentary about They Might Be Giants , a musical duo whose brainy , idiosyncratic brand of pop has earned them decades of cult success .
submarine-2010 That rare teen comedy where the kids are n't gorgeous , the hero is n't heroic and the object of desire has a lot of reasons why she is n't necessarily desirable . New-Wave-y cinematic tricks such as sudden camera zooms and freeze frames , iris shots and snatches of Super 8 suit the film 's introspective , painfully self-conscious protagonist to a T . A bit contrived , maybe , but with Oliver 's dryly hilarious voiceover , Ayoade 's eye for whimsically profound visuals , and music by Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys , it makes more sense than it should . Beautifully and carefully crafted , though the chapter titles are a little too much , elsewhere Submarine is 'indie ' and alternative on all the right beats It 's a familiar story , yes - but we all have to chart our own way through it . Ayoade has taken the old chestnut about each of us being the stars of the film of our life and played it out to its logical artistic extremes . An idiosyncratic tone , one that is both funny and affecting , is far easier to sparingly strike than it is too maintain for the length of a feature . To his not inconsiderable credit , Richard Ayoade keeps a steady , if stylised , hand all the way through . Any addition to the very tall pile of coming-of-age stories is worthy when it boasts darkly witty writing so zeroed in on a 15-year-old 's irrational view of the world . Refreshingly funny , poignant and wonderfully perceptive with razor-sharp wit . It 's the kind of rare coming-of-age film that 's well-acted and abundant in both style and substance . This is Ayoade 's feature debut , and it 's fairly stunning . 	Funny , stylish , and ringing with adolescent truth , Submarine marks Richard Ayoade as a talent to watch .
10012042-going the distance There 's just not quite enough to the movie : not enough jokes , not enough obstacles , not enough sex . 'Going the Distance ' is an occasionally diverting look at long-distance relationships that takes a few too many shortcuts . a standard-issue , relationship-thin rom-com that hopes its potty mouth will distance itself from the competition a crass excuse for a film Going the Distance is a reminder of the sorry state of the rom-com , where gross scenes and easy-to-write trash talk have replaced smart dialogue . It smothers the already frail story of their characters ' long-distance relationship with enough R-rated gross-out humor for half a dozen Judd Apatow movies -- except that virtually none of it is funny . Self-conscious and filled with coarse vulgarity , as a romantic comedy , it 's a disappointment . Going the Distance , a new romantic comedy from doco director Nannette Burstein , is pretty much wall to wall with dirty talk , but it does n't seem to have a political or social point to make ; which makes it feel a little empty . There 's also some gallows humor about the record and newspaper industries , but overall this is a light , genial comedy about denial and self-defense . Every time Going the Distance goes for the big dirty joke , the movie loses all rhythm . When it follows its heart , it works rather well . 	It 's timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies , but Drew Barrymore and Justin Long 's screen chemistry does n't make up for Going the Distance 's overall flatness .
brothers 2004 A talented director of ensembles and intimate scenes , Bier again proves herself a powerful , if occasionally overwrought , dramatist . The intimate handheld camera work and the attention to life 's small details bring an emotional authenticity to this heartbreaking story . A wrenching experience ... portrayed with a degree of honesty and intensity that transcends the hackneyed material . An often fascinating look at what it means to be a husband , a friend ... and a brother . The deficiencies of Brothers lie in its wholesale adoption of war film clichs and obvious plotting . What sets Bier 's film apart from similar fare are the consistently fine performances and powerful scenes of surprising ferocity . Bier , honored as an Emerging Master at the Seattle International Film Festival this year , is clearly a director to watch . In her hands , a story that could become melodramatic is gripping and heartbreaking . Psychologically complex and never less than riveting . Un drama familiar intimista y bien actuado sobre los efectos que puede producir un trauma en la vida de las personas , y sobre la oportunidad de cambiar . The film melts into a duel of despair , rivalry and reconciliation that is as pure as it is painful . 	This tense , understated drama explores the complications of individual and social ethics stemming from the repercussions of war on one man and his family .
memories-of-murder Utiliza seu mistrio ( real ) envolvendo o primeiro serial killer sul-coreano para fazer um forte comentrio poltico e , no processo , cria uma narrativa tensa ( mas tambm divertida ) povoada de personagens tragicamente ineptos . What 's singular in all this is the director 's angle into the material , which is subtle , difficult to pin down , elusive . Memories of Murder is such a taut , effective thriller it 's a shame you have to read subtitles to gauge just how good a movie it is . Low-key , unassuming , and crafty in the way it slowly gets under your skin , Memories of Murder is a sly and smart thriller . Horribly , gorily fascinating and slightly unfulfilling Suspenseful , surprising , and psychologically rich . Uneven movie has tonal problems . Achieves an unlikely but ultimately successful blend of blunt-force comedy and desperate investigation . The script is as sloppy as Song ( Kang-ho ) 's unkempt cop , sprinkled with intriguing ideas and imaginative details that , like the investigation , simply get lost in blind alleys . The foregone conclusion only adds an extra layer of fatalism to this tale of ineffectual authority and abusive power . 	Memories of Murder blends the familiar crime genre with social satire and comedy , capturing the all-too human desperation of its key characters .
eden 2015 Eden is an inconsistent look at an artist 's musical journey , although one that eventually finds its rhythm and thematic focus . Even if you are n't an E.D.M . fan , there is much bliss to be found in Eden . Eden is as much about the pains of maturation as it is about the very specific time period and scene in which it occurs . Even with the nostalgia factor behing it , the movies falls short of what it could 've been . [ Full review in Spanish ] Eden gives us the serious , comprehensive Bildungsroman approach to an artist and an art that are fundamentally shallow . Its novelistic episodes build to nothing apart from a sense of loss , of youth squandered . While Hansen-Love hits the major chords in Paul 's life effectively and creates a sense of time expanding before collapsing into memory , the truth is `` Eden '' is often tiring to sit through . Loose and impressionistic , this beautifully shot film traces the career of a DJ who pioneered garage music in France . It 's not an easy film to engage with , since the characters and situations remain stubbornly undefined by the atmospheric filmmaking . If you have enough patience , especially if you find yourself tapping your feet to the beats , you 'll discover an emotional journey of a young man 's entrance into adulthood . An intimate epic to sink into ; it uses the unchanging age of its actors , whose characters stubbornly resist changing for two decades , as a melancholy commentary on the maturation process . Eden winds and meanders through its 21-year course , with supporting characters disappearing and reappearing . But that 's part of what makes it effective : watching time flow by as one man mostly stays in one place . 	Eden uses 1990s club culture as the appropriately intoxicating backdrop for a sensitive , low-key look at aging and the price of pursuing one 's dreams .
1007003-fahrenheit 451 Weird , yes . And wonderful . ... conveys Bradbury 's intellectual vision well enough to stand the test of time more effectively than a number of mindless science fiction films Even at the science-fiction horror-story level , the movie fails -- partly , I think , because Truffaut is too much of an artist to exploit the vulgar possibilities in the material . Francois Truffault 's film adaptation of the classic Ray Bradbury novel is an interesting miss . Holy smoke ! What a pretentious and pedantic production he has made . On the downside , it does n't particularly feel like a Truffaut film , but on the upside , it 's a decent entry in the sci-fi genre . The movie is filmed in a rather low-key , dispassionate manner . Truffaut faces Bradbury 's abstractions head on , not as science-fiction but as humanistic fairy-tale While not one of Truffaut 's strongest film , it is nonetheless one of his few explicitly political works and also boasts sharp imagery by Roeg ) and indelible score by Herrmann . An underrated film , perhaps because it is less science fiction than a tale of 'once upon a time . ' 	Fahrenheit 451 is an intriguing film that suffuses Truffaut 's trademark wit and black humor with the intelligence and morality of Ray Bradbury 's novel .
10012068-repo men With its radiantly ugly visuals , mean-spirited worldview and gut-wrenching levels of gore , Repo Men is about as entertaining as a burst appendix . Ultimately it 's too long , and with too few surprises , to make it worthwhile . If you are n't too repulsed by the general ultra-violence and horror aspects , you 're in for some treats of the gross out variety that could send you reeling to the lobby . Repo Men starts with a sly premise - and then adds literally nothing of worth thereafter . It 's a subversive little outing with a terrific soundtrack and a 'do-unto-others ' moral , and it might appeal -- just a hunch -- to a young male audience . I have n't wanted to walk out of a movie so many times as I did with `` Repo Men ... . '' Beyond its shapeless sense of the future , humdrum story and fairly routine plot mechanics . . . this flick mostly recycles old action-movie parts . The picture is not nearly as deranged as it should 've been , trying urgently to stay friendly when a nice shiny set of Verhoeven-sharp fangs would 've done the premise more justice . Repo Men is a thrilling , bloody , organ-ripping sci-fi spin on a familiar theme . Great stuff at first , but when Law grows a conscience and goes underground with the uninsured , the narrative excitement slumps . 	Repo Men has an intriguing premise , as well as a likable pair of leads , but they 're wasted on a rote screenplay , indifferent direction , and mind-numbing gore .
black snake moan Moan ? You 're more likely to be groaning - or possibly hooting with laughter at the implausibility of this messy , misogynistic melodrama . The movie strolls right past absurdity into offensiveness , by trying to pass this pulp nonsense off as noble art . What Brewer may be doing , other than having a blast , is dragging a lot of ghosty old racial-sexual prejudices out into the disinfecting sunshine to be laughed at as they shrivel and die . Black Snake Moan is an odd little number . It tries to be a lot of things at different times , but is n't particularly successful in any genre . The collision of ideals is also where Black Snake Moan shines as a statement on the value of the cultural melting pot . The picture may look pulpishly provocative , but while Brewer constantly confounded our expectations in Hustle & Flow , this time he barely ruffles our feathers once he establishes his outrageous dime-novel tone . Rae 's body-as-clich remains intact , whether spilling out of her t-shirt or wrapped up in her little white wedding dress . Preachy , schematic and numbingly predictable . Black Snake Moan IS the blues -- a spiritual journey in which love and pain are bound together tighter than a guitar string . While the film kicks off with a steamy shot of Ricci strutting down a country road in cowboy boots and hot pants short enough to shame Daisy Duke herself , Brewer 's torrid tale turns out to be a surprisingly sweet fable about emotional redemption . 	Uninhibited performances , skillful direction , and a killer blues soundtrack elevate Black Snake Moan beyond its outlandish premise .
1017834-romeo and juliet ... may not be great Shakespeare , but it 's compelling , impassioned filmmaking . Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a lovely , sensitive , friendly popularization of the play ... Neither lead is a skilled actor , but the film 's lush and unrepentant romanticism carries the day A staple of lazy high school English teachers everywhere . Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is best version on film . A more romantic and realistic rendition of the nature of love , I have never seen . The success of the film depends upon Whiting and Miss Hussey ... They are magnificent . Despite major trimmings of Shakespeare 's text , this is a lovely version of the much-filmed play , largely due to the casting of the leads with handsome , unknown teenagers . As a widespread social critique and a fatalistic exploration of romance 's pitfalls , it resonates . The best screen adaptation of Shakespeare 's wonderful romance . 	The solid leads and arresting visuals make a case for Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet as the definitive cinematic adaptation of the play .
the martian Good actors fill almost every role , from Jessica Chastain as the captain of Watney 's ill-fated mission to Chiwetel Ejiofor as a NASA official with a troubled conscience . At its core , it 's a survival epic in which the hero is the scientific method : developing testable theories , gathering the data , refining the tests , sometimes going back to the drawing board . Make no mistake , at 141 minutes , The Martian is a bit of a hike . But it 's a tribute to Scott 's command , Damon 's charisma and Goddard 's script that this two-hour-plus movie about a guy by himself on Mars works as well as it does . An impecably produced but ultimately uninspired movie . [ Full rewiew in Spanish ] Based on the wildly popular 2011 book by American author Andy Weir , the movie 's conceptual co-ordinates triangulate somewhere close to Gravity meets Cast Away via Apollo 13 . This first-rate popcorn film is one of the best of the year . 'The Martian ' is one of the best movies of the year . It is a wondrous adventure that dreamers and doers , as well as those who set their sights on the heavens , can embrace and rally around . Combined with the kind of breathtaking cinematography that gave the director his name , and a sense of diluted optimism running through it , and you have a film that sails through its lengthy run time . The script is so technical it could be used as a survival manual for being lost in outer space . Hell , Sean Bean 's in this movie and *he does n't die . * It does n't get much more feel-good than that . 	Smart , thrilling , and surprisingly funny , The Martian offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott .
exploding girl This is a mature story about the lives of two young people ( and one voice ) that kept my attention from start to finish . Kazan has a power of her own that is as strong as or stronger than the film 's style , and she can carry a scene all by herself , even if the camera is merely watching her walk down the street . ... a lovely , languorous film that does much with little and leaves you feeling like you 've witnessed some minor miracle . Gray 's limpid compositions draw plangent stillness from urban darkness , counterpointing but not unbalancing his actors ' understated naturalism . The glib response `` Explode already ! '' stands , despite a few intriguingly tender moments within a narrative in which listlessness overwhelms incident . Mr. Gray 's achievement -- and Ms. Kazan 's , too -- is to make you care enough about Ivy to be curious about her . But The Exploding Girl can also make you feel bad about wishing that she were just a little more interesting . A Zen-like experience of watchful compassion in deliberately challenging circumstances : trying to see and hear , without leaping to conclusions , the gathering troubles of a young woman living in hectic circles and with increasing self-absorption . This quietly poetic little gem contains many beautiful things , not least of which is leading lady Zoe Kazan , who lets every scene billow and swirl around her effortlessly . The Exploding Girl is a character study of one young woman - and of an entire generation struggling to maintain external maturity despite internal regression . Those who can hang on through the mumblecore-ish narrative languor of the nicely photographed The Exploding Girl will savor a very talented actress ' sensitive portrait of youthful awkwardness . 	Its languid pace and willfully understated narrative may test the patience of some viewers , but Bradley Rust Gray 's gentle direction and a gripping performance from Zoe Kazan lend The Exploding Girl an appealing , melancholy beauty .
namesake When The Namesake focuses on the family and Gogol 's struggle to understand what his father means to him , the film is a rich experience . But side trips into Gogol 's romantic life are thin . The Namesake is a rich and moving motion picture . Deserves credit for its graceful attempt to tell an all-American story with warm , unromanticized characters trying to discover who they are in a land too eager to impose its own definition on them . A rich , if not completely satisfying , pleasure . The Namesake is worth seeing for its unflinching depiction of family hardships and stunning cinematography . The performances are formidable and moving , and there 's much to be gleaned about the natural , universal clash between generations and between cultures . The Namesake , about a Bengali couple who raise their family in New York , is rich in particulars . Yet the emphasis in Mira Nair 's film version of Jhumpa Lahiri 's best-selling novel keeps falling on the generic . Una pelcula fresca , reveladora , emotiva , graciosa , encantadora , que se disfruta como un viaje o como un viejo libro que nos han dejado guardado para abrir , por primera vez , en el momento justo . The Namesake illuminates the immigrant experience in ways that feel at once exotic and deeply familiar . Buoyed by terrific performances from Irrfan Kahn and the tremendous Tabu , the film is a bit homogenized but does a good job of exploring the dynamics of blending foreign cultures with American ways of life . 	An ambitious exploration of the immigrant experience with a talented cast that serves the material well .
diamond men Watching Diamond Men , it 's easy to see what the fuss about Forster is about . A gem of a movie . O. Henry huggable , the quaint Diamond Men has nothing but love for growing old and the rebirth of love . Genuine , amusing and , best of all , humanly scaled and humanely oriented . The pleasure that these two men share in one another 's company , both as characters and performers , radiates through every frame . Cohen , who has been in the diamond business , has directed with a sure , non-wasteful hand and with touching empathy for both men . When [ Forster and Wahlberg each ] turned out to be acquainted with a lady of the evening whose real job is dispensing spiritual and financial wisdom , the cliches were too blinding for me to overlook . As with so many other recent indie films he has appeared in , it is Forster who truly shines . The kind of keenly observed , artfully crafted , warmly humane movie that keeps us going through the weekly helping of big-screen duds . It provides a charming showcase for an actor [ Forster ] whose lack of stardom will never be adequately explained . 	Robert Forster 's tour-de-force performance , along with Daniel M. Cohen 's sensitive direction and subtly shaded screenplay , brings rare heft to this mentor/protg buddy film .
jay and silent bob strike back The picture lacks the mix of innocence and savagery that branded [ Smith 's ] other films . Because we like this world , and the characters plug away at the jokes so enthusiastically , this film brings a smile to the face . What do you want , some meditation on the human condition ? Smith said this is the last time he will foist Jay and Bob on movie audiences . Please let him be a man of his word . Unlike , say , American Pie 2 or the Scary Movie franchise , there 's obvious intelligence at work behind the stupidity . If there were ever a movie that deserved that label `` For Fans Only '' , this is it . A road/chase comedy that wants nothing more than to make the audience laugh -- and are there ever laughs to be had . Smith 's script is the funniest of this dimbulb summer , and the sharpest he has ever written . Wicked fun and another feather in the cap of Kevin Smith . a dense comedy ( whereas Jay is just ... dense ) , which is to say there are more jokes ... than in any comedy I 've seen in a long time 	Fans can expect a good laugh as the cast from Smith 's previous films reunite for Jay and Silent Bob 's last bow . The loose plotting and crude language may be too much for others though .
war-2007 A disappointment , failing to capitalize on the charisma of its two leads or even give them anything that interesting to do . [ Jet ] Li and [ Jason ] Statham 's characters represent respect for life and art ; they 're also purifying a contaminated genre . Building to a climactic twist as arbitrary as it is unsatisfying , WarK ties itself in knots trying to bring something new to a stale formula . It 's never painful to watch , but that 's only because it provokes no feeling at all . A cliff notes version of an action movie . The story is threadbare ... Lacking even the galvanizing action sequences that would have compensated for suffering through its formulaic plot , this is a thoroughly forgettable exploitationer . A generic action flick made much worse by a couple of ridiculous plot twists that are disingenuous and a total rip-off , ruining what little fun it otherwise would have been . Acaba revelando , em seu ato final , um esforo intrigante para surpreender o espectador , a esta altura , j fomos obrigados a agentar uma infinidade de dilogos desastrosos e seqncias frouxas de ao e pouco pode ser feito para salvar o filme . All together now : 'War ! Hurgh ! What is it it good for ? ' The teaming of action stars Jet Li and Jason Statham may raise audience expectations for a lean , mean ass-kicking machine , but War turns out to be a flabby and formulaic programmer . 	Jet Li and Jason Statham find themselves on opposing sides in the immensely boring War , which is full of clichs but short on action .
nico and dani [ Gay ] grasps the thrilling , disorienting shapelessness of teen desire and coaxes superbly unaffected performances from his young leads . May elicit memories of your own years of mixed joys and sorrows when you felt either high or low but rarely on an even keel . A movie more interested in shocking than in entertaining . Packed with 100-percent authentic moments of adolescence . Manages to be both joyful and unnerving in its unflinching portrayal of emerging sexuality . It makes up for much of its shortcomings with its sensitive consideration of sexuality , adoration , friendship , and late adolescence . The rare coming-of-age film that avoids cliches , refuses to engage in stereotypes , and wins over both your intellect and your heart . A refreshingly frank treatment of some terribly overworked territory . Could be useful to a confused teenager , suggesting that we all have to choose our own paths in life . A perceptive portrayal of growing up and growing apart . 	Nico and Dani offers a refreshingly honest look at adolescence and sexual coming-of-age .
super troopers It made me yearn for the golden era of January , when Slackers was released . Jay Chandrasekhar helms this wacky vehicle with all the conviction of a defective police siren ... feels more like an excuse for Chandrasekhar and his fratboy Broken Lizard comedy troupe players to merge and serve up their pet project just to kill some time This is one of those films that makes movie critics embarassed to admit they liked it without first smoking a joint . The movie 's mostly a succession of predictable skits , leavened only by the occasional amusing one-liner and played by actors who are n't actors so much as just a bunch of guys goofing off . A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . This seemingly endless sitcom is too infatuated with its own hijinks to realize they 're virtually witless . An appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . ... does n't have enough plot or successful jokes to keep it afloat . This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 	A more-miss -than-hit affair , Super Troopers will most likely appeal to those looking for something silly .
rocky balboa Rocky Balboa , the sixth ( and hopefully last ) installment in the underdog saga of the Italian Stallion , straddles the line between nostalgia and self-parody and frequently teeters toward the latter . The proverbial sun has set with enough grace to make us all feel a little apologetic for the doubt we all had on the character who was a champ well before he was ever a champion . The big surprise is that it also has just enough referential wit and nostalgic charm to keep the smiles coming through the schmaltz . Rocky Balboa is the best Rocky movie since the original and a fitting final ( we hope ) tribute to one of the great American movie characters . Sylvester Stallone , 60 , still looks great with his shirt off . It 's his directing , writing and acting skills that at times seem out of shape . Mock Stallone all you want . I want to also , but I ca n't . He understands that the character is much bigger than himself , an American emblem that will long outlive him . Plays like Stallone simply headed to the set with his handy Rocky checklist , ticked off all the items and called it a day . Though even in this incarnation Rocky remains a likable lug , he was unwise to come out of well-deserved retirement . Above all this is a film for gluttons for punishment , for those who never ever can get enough of Sylvester Stallone . Everyone else , please leave the building . Yo , Rocky fans , he 's back ! This is the way Stallone wants to close this chapter and you can tell he put his heart into the project . It does n't always work , but when it does , it 's a knockout . 	Implausible but entertaining and poignant , Rocky Balboa finds the champ in fighting form for the first time in years .
10009151-box Although an improvement on Southland Tales , Richard 'Donnie Darko ' Kelly 's cryptic moody thriller has a far-fetched premise that is not helped by a script filled with holes . An allegorical hash that fails as often as it succeeds in articulating its one core , coherent point : we are as moral as our options . Nowhere near as bad as the hype suggests - although if you 're in the mood for something straightforward , this is not for you . The choice is yours , but I suggest you push that button for your ticket and see The Box in theaters . A lot of stuff about Nasa , Mars exploration and amateur theatre - Sartre 's Huis Clos and its glowing chestnut adages ( `` Hell is other people '' ) - add to the film 's richness or , depending on opinion , its overcooked confusion . So shudder to think what [ Matheson would ] make of this dogs ' dinner of an adaptation by Richard Kelly , a shambles rivalled only by the writer-director 's own Southland Tales . Steven Poster 's chilly photography , the Bernard Hermann-esque score by the Arcade Fire , the quiet malice of Frank Langella ... knowing that these things lie within 'The Box , ' why would n't you take a chance and open it ? The Box is by no means as indigestible as Southland Tales , and there 's as much to relish as there is to groan at . For those willing to follow Kelly down all the rabbit holes his warped imagination contrives , there are small treasures to be found here and there . I think that Richard Kelly , from one film to the next , has gone in some very interesting and sometimes puzzling directions . 	Imaginative but often preposterous , The Box features some thrills but largely feels too piecemeal .
im not there suppositions on a film concerning dylan [ Director Todd Haynes ] gives us a sense of how Bob Dylan bestrode ( and bemused ) his time . Haynes , astutely perhaps , has created a biopic with little time for `` justice '' or indeed any of the reverence and piety of recent films such as Walk the Line or Ray . I 'm Not There would make a fine exercise for graduate school analysis . I 'm just not sure how well it works as a movie . Forget the six impersonations of Bob Dylan . Ultimately , I 'm Not There is all about Todd Haynes trying to be Jean-Luc Godard . ... may not get any closer to the 'truth ' than a conventional biopic would , but at least the movie snubs conventional formula in favor of its own , folk-rock-gospel rhythm . Uma das cinebiografias mais atpicas e , por isto mesmo , mais fiis ao esprito criativo de seu biografado que j tive o prazer de assistir . It 's not your average biopic but it 's unforgettable all the same . It does n't all work and it runs too long . But every fragment of Dylan 's life , every version of him , from the funny to the tippy , rings true . One of the sexiest pieces of cinema I 've seen at a festival . How does it feeeel ? Like a rolling shambles , much of it , and even a second viewing does n't erase the sensation . 	I 'm Not There 's unique editing , visuals , and multiple talented actors portraying Bob Dylan make for a deliciously unconventional experience . Each segment brings a new and fresh take on Dylan 's life .
in this world It 's a tremendous human drama , with each stage of its characters ' journey a white-knuckle thriller in miniature . In This World unfolds with the deceptive dispassion of a documentary , but builds with a sure sense of dramatic epic . It 's impossible to call In This World melodramatic because it never develops dramatically . It only tosses us straight into Jamal and Enayat 's struggle . By keeping his focus small and personal , director Michael Winterbottom completely immerses a viewer in Jamal and Enayat 's experience . It 's quite devastating . It is an extraordinarily intimate evocation of just how helpless it feels to be a refugee . Unfortunately it is no more informative , possibly even less involving , than umpteen pieces of print and television reportage that have set out similarly to chronicle one of the major humanitarian crises of our age . [ Winterbottom ] gives us a glimpse of the hell people go through for the dream of economic betterment . In This World defies you to remain unmoved . Without an ounce of phony Hollywood uplift , Winterbottom 's film cuts right to the heart . Downbeat but surprisingly moving drama . 	Using documentary-style filmmaking to blur the lines between fact and fiction . In This World tells a harrowing but important story about the plight of refugees .
lost and delirious It practically slits its own wrists with desperate longing . Geez , where 's Mrs. Garrett when you need her ? Pool convierte el inerte celuloide en un pedazo vivo de realidad humana . Una pelcula que navega de lo frgil a lo tosco y de vuelta . Piper Perabo is the real winner here , with a role that showcases her flamboyant acting style and personality we did n't see in 'Coyote Ugly . ' It 's a strange , not always felicitous tone the film strives for , but it does achieve one uniquely its own . Pool captures the crazed urgency of first love -- the feeling of a passion so fierce that even a disapproving society ca n't crush it . Less than an overwhelming success , but it 's still touching and troubling , and amounts to much more than the average portrayal of teen angst . Overly concerned with not offending its audience . A moving and erotic depiction of the pangs of first love in an all-girl environment . Pool is an assured director , not afraid to explore the darker side of adolescence with integrity . 	Lost and Delirious becomes exactly that , as the film sinks into overwrought melodrama and cliched , obvious symbolism .
102 dalmatians Mildly amuses but offers little of its predecessors ' imagination . A fun family film that is much warmer , gentler and funnier than the uncomfortably sadistic 1996 remake . It makes me truly fearful of having to sit through 103 Dalmatians , which will be an inevitability after this one makes another $ 100 million . A slightly better , and certainly more tolerable , effort than the original version ( not the animated one ) . Sequel better than first live-action Dalmatians movie . It 's boring to all age groups and contains some violent images , which may bother very young children . Guess which filmmakers did n't have the smarts to license 'Who Let the Dogs Out ' ? The plot is dully formulaic , and the comeuppance of the villains is of the incessant , sadistic Home Alone variety . Amiable , undemanding family holiday entertainment . The movie is diverting enough to keep kids and parents watching for a couple of hours . 	This sequel to the live-action 101 Dalmatians is simply more of the same . Critics say it also drags in parts , potentially boring children , and that it 's too violent for a G-rated movie .
reanimator Re-Animator exploits our fears of segmentation , of being many fragments of a body living independently . A classic ground-breaking Grand Guignol horror picture . While Re-Animator fails as a faithful adaptation of Lovecraft , it is an incredibly demented movie in its own right that combines a plethora of downright disgusting grand guignol with disturbing black humor . When Stuart Gordon 's Re-Animator arrived in 1985 , it set a benchmark in horror-comedy that few films have matched since . This is one of the greatest films ever made . Period . It 's outrageous , erotic , gory , jaw-dropping , genre-busting , shocking , and altogether exhilarating filmmaking . Re-Animator was Stuart Gordon 's first ( and best ) movie . A bloody fun time for those with strong stomachs . Thumpingly good gore-fest . The plot ... took a genre obsessed with masked killers , monsters et al , completely by storm . Because Re-Animator is so poorly acted and directed ( by Stuart Gordon , whose first film this is ) , there is no tension to break . So the gruesome scenes are just clinical and dull . 	Perfectly mixing humor and horror , the only thing more effective than Re-Animator 's gory scares are its dry , deadpan jokes .
proposition a mythic exploration of the ever shifting frontier between savagery and civilisation in an unforgiving landscape . It 's consistently compelling and thought-provoking . This one will stay with you , and despite its disturbing moments , you 'll welcome it . The Proposition is an epic drama on a grand scope . Any movie that can cling to your memory with as much brutal power as this fantastic film is unquestionably a proposition worth taking . If Peter Weir , Sam Peckinpah and Jim Jarmusch could somehow collaborate on a film written by Joseph Conrad , it would probably look something like this . The strength of The Proposition is its relentless moral ambiguity . A near-masterpiece of mood and menace , and one that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible . It does n't offer much that has n't already been said about lawless frontier towns , bonds between outlaws or the settling of the West . When it comes to condemning the ancient Western code of violence , this film should practice what it preaches . The climactic Christmas Day dinner of dreadful retribution is a terrifying prospect , but for anyone with a yen for our great lost genre , it 's also some sort of gift . 	Brutal , unflinching , and violent , but thought-provoking and with excellent performances , this Australian western is the one of the best examples of the genre to come along in recent times .
secret lives of dentists Rarely does a film cause those visceral adrenaline rushes of recognizing greatness , but `` The Secret Lives of Dentists '' brings waves of them . An intelligent , perceptive , stylish but quietly controlled study of mid-life insecurity and marital infidelity . Deeply felt . There are many films about marriages that are n't quite working , but I ca n't name a better one at portraying just how difficult marriage and family life are , despite everyone 's best intentions . A moving and eerily accurate glance into the wandering mind of a married man . Seems vaguely interested in American domestic ennui , but ends up feeling -- wait for it ( yawn ) -- like pulling teeth . A toothsome black comedy about a failing marriage . Neither the story nor the characters exerts enough pull , and the fantasy bits are more annoying than revealing . A faultlessly constructed , artistic look at love , loss and truths we ca n't ignore . A powerful examination of contemporary family life . 	A witty and honest look at marriage in decay .
25th hour A moving tribute to resilience in the face of ruination . Lee is in pretty good form in 25th Hour , and the film , while not a thunderbolt , is a welcome surprise . With all the great actors and social commentary going for it , 25th Day fails due to Spike 's inability to trust the audience . Spike Lee 's best film since Clockers . Norton convincingly portrays both the good and bad side of his conflicted man . Bold , inspired , and provocative . Though the subject matter is despairing , the movie is most certainly alive . In sum , uneven , with a strong Norton , incompatible score , but , of course you 'll love the dog -- and the good message/reminder . Lee overloads a featherweight story with pretentious subtext and showy technique . Lee , as he did in Malcolm X and Clockers , makes his hero 's dread palpable , and though 25th Hour lacks the glittering brilliance of those films , I was held by the toughness and pity of Lee 's gaze . There 's a new maturity on display here , and the result is the director 's most satisfying feature in over a decade . 	An intelligent and well-acted film despite the usual Spike Lee excesses .
edward scissorhands An original movie , though not Tim Burton 's best . Tim Burton and Johnny Depp come close to achieving perfection in this dream tale . One of my favorite films ... and one that touches me deeply . Tim Burton 's finest achievement . It has an emotional wallop to go with his visual wizardry . The romanticism has a personal dimension -- for Edward is , of course , Burton 's surreal portrait of himself as an artist : a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions . Like Edward , he finds the light . Enchantment on the cutting edge , a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin . A personal film for Tim Burton , which also serves as a parable about the artist as an outsider , this lovely fairytale began the long , fruitful collaboration with the endlessly versatile Johnny Depp . Depp is perfectly cast , Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world , and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest , Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin . Burton 's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year 's most comic , romantic and haunting film fantasy . A modern fairy tale about a deformed outsider whose innocence and gentle nature make him a freak in the eyes of the community he visits . 	The first collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton , Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with gothic overtones and a sweet center .
1145385-unleashed Unfortunately , the fight scenes ( and there are several ) are very frontloaded . An enjoyable , off-beat action thriller that has 'Future Cult Movie ' written all over it . Falls short as an emotional drama but brings down the house with its incredible fight choreography and action sequences . Uniquely entertaining in a visceral , emotional way . Benefits from an unabashedly sentimental heart . [ Has ] three or four gangbusters action sequences , all of which are unexpectedly stomach-clenching . Permeated with dark shadows that recall Frankenstein and The Elephant Man , Unleashed features a quite clever premise before detouring into a plot twist that should 've been muzzled . Freeman is better than his role , and Hoskins is a powerful presence . Li almost pulls off a psychologically complex role . But in the end , Unleashed is a muddled film . Unleashed is the kind of martial arts movie we would see if Tom Hanks could execute a flying spin kick . A nice , violent little film about the redemptive powers of art and love . 	Jet Li gets to emote in some emotionally awkward scenes , but the gritty fight sequences come through in what is Li 's best English language film .
knuckle 2011 It 's a technically rough but personally moving look at family rivalry . There are times during this bare-knuckle brawlathon that you really fear for the safety of documentarian Ian Palmer . Palmer shows real integrity and gets incredible access , but there 's only so long you can watch people beating the hell out of each other before wanting to throw in the towel yourself . Knuckle tells you more than you ever wanted to know - in my case , not much - about family feuding and bare-knuckle fighting among Irish travellers . A deeply unsettling experience . It 's all a little rough and ready , and by its nature rather repetitive , but as a look inside a normally hidden part of an already insular culture , Knuckle packs a genuine punch . An extraordinarily compelling and hard-hitting portrait of two Irish families and their decades-old , bare-knuckled feud . Knuckle is often like Waiting for Godot , only bloodier . A black comedy without the comedy . Knuckle convinces as a statement against the futility of violence , of how keeping alive the petty anger of a single moment only serves to dominate and ruin the life experiences of the next generation . 	A gritty documentary that captures the brutality and banality of bare-knuckle fights among Irish Travellers .
1215792-amreeka A winning tale of battling racism and prejudice in multi-cultural America . Although the drama heads on a predictable course , Faour brings intelligence and humor to her performance and Muallem , as the smart adolescent turned surly and scared , is likewise sharp . Writer director Cherien Dabis writes about what she knows about being a stranger in a new land : the difficulties , the isolation , the conflicts , the misunderstandings . The result is a heartfelt and engaging film uneven -- but also smart and impressingly earnest ... a small budget , sincere little film that has its heart in the right place . The good humor , generosity , and love Dabis bestows on her characters in this assured first feature are uniquely hers -- the mark of a talent to watch You 'll end up baffled that a film built on such shaky foundations can end up being so impossibly sweet . It 's charming and laidback , preferring wry , compassionate humour to politicking . A giant bland-fest , unleashing a misfiring charm offensive in place of strong characterisation or a story that has a destination in mind . Does it occur to xenophobic Americans that almost all immigrants , like their own ancestors , came here because they admire the United States ? Someone please explain that to Lou Dobbs . 	A dramedy that 's got a taste for the tragic as well as the poignantly comic , Amreeka adds a new sweetness to the hope and distress of the immigrant experience .
mr beans holiday As a character who does n't play on your sympathies , Bean somehow seems less tiresome , less demanding , less of a nuisance . Taking on a more European sensibility , Bean seems to have gone back to the drawing board , and come up with gags that were last funny when we were a couple of steps back in the Evolution of Man wallchart . little more than a string of sketches stitched together to form something close to a feature film . But that should n't bother those who like solid slapstick , which 'Holiday ' provides in abundance . Too often in Mr. Bean 's Holiday , you get the feeling Rowan Atkinson and his collaborators confused the notion of 'building a gag slowly ' with 'forgetting to build one at all ' . If you are as repelled by the previews for movies like Balls of Fury or The Comeback , come give the old school a try . It 's cunningly made . For a silly kids movie about an accident-prone man on a trip to the beach , Mr. Bean 's Holiday is actually quite mean-spirited and pretentious . Bean and Carson are less different than they are the same , both self-centered and nave , sad and lonely . Worse , Bean 's movie is n't even as funny as Carson 's . What could have been a series of big and bigger set pieces instead flows smoothly from each corny gag to the next goofy slapstick routine . One of the year 's most enjoyable surprises . For younger audiences , Mr. Bean 's Holiday will be a pleasure , and of course , Bean addicts will , as always , be happy to see Atkinson 's alter ego return to the big screen . 	Mr. Bean 's Holiday means well , but good intentions ca n't withstand the 90 minutes of monotonous slapstick and tired , obvious gags .
tangled In speaking to my fellow reviewers upon exiting the theater , it was noted among us that nobody could remember a single musical number -- not one . Captures some of the best elements of Disney standards while nimbly integrating the clever pop-culture winks and dazzling technical style that are hallmarks of modern computer-animated features . Is it on a par with films such as The Little Mermaid ? No , but it 's a worthy addition to the lineage Tangled might not ultimately be a modern Disney classic ... but it 's nevertheless a lot of fun , full of humor , adventure , good music and great production values Vibrant , funny , and oh so sweet , Tangled is rousing family entertainment which belongs in the top tier of Disney 's illustrious pantheon of classics . Oddly , there has never been a full length film of the Grimm brothers ' Rapunzel until now , and the good news is that the first one is a peach . A total delight that should please fans of classic Disney storytelling no matter what demographic they 're in . A heroine who finds love and freedom after she loses acres of blond Barbie hair -- these days , that 's a radical fable . The best non-Pixar Disney movie since 1994 's The Lion King ... This is classic Disney ; a reworking of an old fairy tale with a nice little feminist touch of female empowerment . 	While far from Disney 's greatest film , Tangled is a visually stunning , thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio 's classic animated canon .
kon tiki 2012 The film harks back to the era of `` Swiss Family Robinson , '' when films were like well-made hospital beds , all four corners neatly tucked . A big-spirited and inspiring boy 's own adventure . The wacky , amateurish derring-do of the six-man crew , led by the lanky , floppy haired Pl Sverre Valheim Hagen as the ethnographer Heyerdahl , is astounding . An old fashioned true life adventure yarn , old fashioned in all the best ways . While this ambitious Norwegian historical adventure sometimes dips into melodrama , it 's a riveting , fascinating true story about passion and tenacity . The historic trans-Pacific boat trip undertaken in 1947 by Norwegian hero Thor Heyerdahl and his crew of fellow adventurers is here presented as a daring sea-faring adventure with angry weather and sharks . One of the goals of a great outdoor epic is to keep you breathless with wonder . Technically , dramatically and cinematically awesome , Kon-Tiki delivers in spades . A handsomely-mounted human drama , epic in scope if not execution , Kon-Tiki is a worthy testament to the magnitude of the feat it portrays . The voyage features some spectacularly exciting encounters with wildlife , difficult negotiations among the men and one stunning vista after another of sunny , blue gorgeousness . Directors Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg certainly seize the opportunity to deliver a spirited high seas adventure , taking some creative liberties along the way , but remaining true to the spirit of the times and the participants . 	A well-crafted retelling of an epic true story , Kon Tiki is a throwback to old-school adventure filmmaking that 's exciting and entertaining in spite of its by-the-book plotting .
seeker the dark is rising Director David L. Cunningham and screenwriter John Hodge ( `` Trainspotting '' ) conspire with a gruelingly slow pacing to underpin nebulous special effects sequences . `` The Seeker '' is a children 's fantasy movie worth avoiding . The Dark is Rising is one of those awful sorcery tales where a spotty young boy ( Alexander Ludwig ) suddenly gets to save the Earth from supernatural creeps such as Christopher Eccleston . Director David L. Cunningham 's proffered chills are strictly of the lightweight variety : a menacing flock of ravens , a slimy skein of snakes and a couple of mall security yobs too fat or stupid to overpower even a spindly teenager . [ A ] ponderous , clumping fantasy with confusing and seemingly contradictory internal logic . Not-too-impressive CG effects and frenetic camera work but can not mask what is -- or , rather , what is n't there . [ The filmmakers ] jam together action sequences that are too intense for younger viewers with a story too dumb for teens . Ecclestein and McShane are so captivating it 's almost worth putting up with The Seeker 's inept script . Whether you fully embrace the Harry Potter phenomenon or simply live with it , there 's no question that J. K. Rowling is an imaginative story-spinner . The trouble is that she has ruined the field for the legions of the second-rate . The special effects are not spectacular , but they are certainly adequate and Cunningham keeps the action moving so that the pace never flags . The bum execution ironically sheds light on just how dim this film about light and dark really is . 	The magic of the book is lost in translation with The Seeker , due to its clumsy plot and lack of heart .
steamboy In spite of ... obvious and unfortunate flaws , if you 're going to see Steamboy do so on the big screen so as to be reminded of the marvels of hand-drawn animation Feels as needlessly over-engineered as the movie 's own city-demolishing retro-futuristic hardware . It 's nifty to behold , but about the only drama in Steamboy lies in waiting for this colossal hovering machine-monster to blow a gasket . tomo is a good enough storyteller to keep 'Steamboy ' from overheating . Works more than it fails . Loaded with eye candy , though it lacks the sophisticated storytelling and character development of Japanese director Katushiro Otomo 's classic Akira . Visually impressive , but I thought it was never going to end . The sci-fi wonders ... are truly marvelous and go a long way toward making up for the film 's erratic pacing . Never really pops its rivets except in several thrilling action sequences , but the sharp imagery and inventive technology make it worthwhile for animation fans . Despite its wild dreams , it becomes just another rusty piece of animated machinery , going through the motions somewhat mechanically . 	The story is n't the greatest , but there 's an abundance of sci-fi eye candy to compensate .
willow creek Willow Creek is Goldthwait flexing a whole new set of film-making muscles and he proves that there 's some life left in the found footage genre . Bobcat Goldthwait exposes the characteristic male pursuit of power to which females are often made subservient . The parts are greater than the whole , but there 's a lot to like here , including the easy interplay between the leads . One of the best things about Willow Creek is that it represents someone 's unwavering vision , and in today 's commodity oriented movie marketplace , that 's unusual indeed . Though it 's disappointing to see Goldthwait step away from the conceptual audacity of his previous work ... Willow Creek does everything a little bit better than others of its kind . Johnson and Gilmore have an easygoing rapport ... But once their characters venture deep into the woods , the film has nowhere to go but down the same narrative path as almost every found-footage tale since The Blair Witch Project began the craze in 1999 . It 's all well and good to want to say things using the world of a horror movie , but it 's even better when you do n't forget to try and be scary for 75 % of the runtime . By aping upon other like-minded pictures and never quite releasing himself from the shackles of humdrum convention , director Bobcat Goldthwait sells himself short . Willow Creek is yet another found-footage horror film but it 's a fresh and engaging one , combining tongue-in-cheek humour with some genuinely creepy moments . by turns funny and frightening ... a perfect hybridisation of familiar found footage tropes and transgressive Bobcattery . 	Writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait 's first foray into horror does n't break any new ground , but it does wring fresh terror from a well-worn genre formula -- and offers a few nasty laughs in the bargain .
lets go to prison The sad thing is that Arnett , Shepard and McBride quickly establish a loose , easy camaraderie that 's a real pleasure to watch . The shame is that they 're working with such unrewarding material . As a comedy , Bob Odenkirk 's penitentiary send-up is bootless . The elements of dark comedy , prison system satire , and juvenile gross-out gags eventually blend like the slop ladled out for inmates at feeding time . It is awful , unfunny and moronic . And that applies to the best bits . Most of the movie is even worse . The main crime in this movie is that the whole thing feels lazy -- it 's as if they filmed the first draft of a script that still needed some trimming and sharpening . If movies could be punished , Let 's Go to Prison would be sent to solitary confinement for impersonating a prison comedy . A comedy of tremendous miscalculation that does n't even have the conviction of its own stupidity . Prison makes its 84-minute running time feel like a five-year sentence with no chance for parole . Life 's too short . its off-kilter wit is displayed with stinginess ( or is it laziness ? ) . 	Let 's Go to Prison is guilty on all counts of cliched setups , base humor , and failure to ellicit laughs .
1108372-fast and the furious What is unforgivable is that many of the racing scenes were boring too . A good racing flick with real thrills and true talent behind the camera . It 's refreshing to see a production so unrepentantly cheesy . It at least has the honesty and charm of a straightforward exploitation movie , and it definitely lives up to its title . The guys in F & F are all wusses . Lara Croft and Charlie 's Angels could kick all of their asses . If you 're 14 and love Limp Bizkit , or 50 and yearn to lay down some rubber , chances are you 'll think this honey corners like it 's on rails . But if you do n't mind being taken for a mindless adrenaline ride across the glittering blacktops of Los Angeles , this could be excused as a guilty pleasure treat . May be a cheesy movie , but it 's a fun cheesy movie . Pure , unadulterated teen exploitation filmmaking at its best . A spectacular start to one of Hollywood 's most surprising and popular franchises ever . 	Sleek and shiny on the surface , The Fast and the Furious recalls those cheesy teenage exploitation flicks of the 1950s .
time crimes Enjoyable , smartly directed time travel thriller with strong performances and a genuinely creepy atmosphere , though the twists are a little predictable . Acaba se revelando excessivamente previsvel e conta com um protagonista fraco , mas ainda assim diverte e prende a ateno com sua trama circular . Watching `` Timecrimes '' is like stumbling in a pitch-black haunted house . Hitting walls where paths should be is fun , and time-travel tropes of choice versus fate are inventively goosed . Even with five minutes left , it could conclude in any number of ways . A grimly funny sci-fi determinist 's challenge to the very idea of free will . An invigoratingly imaginative and thrilling ride full of clever surprises and twists . While it is n't that hard to stay a step or two ahead of Timecrimes , the movie is still a nifty little genre piece , an old-fashioned science-fiction mind-game with a healthy dollop of 'Oh , the irony . ' [ Director ] Vigalondo impressively never loses control of the deliberately bewildering material . Even Cronenberg would be hard-pressed to improve on this smart , mordantly funny film . His film is satisfying in its clever construction and vivid style . It begins slowly , but when it gets going , it rings a series of amusing , if not entirely unpredictable , changes on the theme 'what if you went back in time and changed things ? ' The film 's plentiful complications are n't necessarily unique ... but they 're given corkscrew verve by taut plotting and correspondingly fleet , no-nonsense direction . 	Timecrimes is a low-budget thriller that 's well-crafted and loaded with dark humor and bizarre twists .
prince of egypt If de Mille had seen this film , he would have gone back to the drawing board ! the people at DreamWorks put their brushes to the film with the spirit Moses put his staff in the mighty Nile , lighting it up with the eerie color of bloodshed . The animation in this retelling of the story of Moses is rich and vivid . You almost can taste the sand . It 's sophisticated , both intellectually and morally ! The movie has some astonishing visual effects . A visually breathtaking film ! The story is big and broad enough as it is , it does n't need add-ons . It 's almost like they set out to out-Disney Disney . If The Prince of Egypt falls short in its song and story , it succeeds gloriously in its epic grandeur and visual splendor . This animated Bible story raises the level of film artistry to new heights ! The animation is breathtaking . 	The Prince of Egypt 's stunning visuals and first-rate voice cast more than compensate for the fact that it 's better crafted than it is emotionally involving .
romancing the stone After all the Raiders rip-offs , it 's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison , that has the same spirit and sense of humor . A high-spirited cocktail of action , comedy and romance that 's one of those rare movies with something for almost everyone . The chemistry between the principles is something that no one can deny . The message is clear : Love and protection comes with a white face and a big , black gun . His name is Michael Douglas . often copied , but never quite duplicated Zemeckis initiates his string of hits here . A surprisingly witty script , some really excellent chemistry between Douglas & Turner , and a large ( and very welcome ) portion of comic relief by Danny DeVito . Fun stuff . All very tongue-in-cheek ( typified by the opening sequence , lifted straight from one of Joan 's pulp novels ) and great fun . Magical chemistry make this Stone a polished romantic/action/comedy . great fun , terrific characters 	Romancing the Stone reaches back to the classic Saturday morning serials of old with an action-filled adventure enlivened by the sparkling chemistry between its well-matched leads .
map of the world A truly remarkable film . It is just not for everyone . Disappointingly unengaging . May be too painful and downbeat for many moviegoers . But it redefines courage in acting . In this season of Oscar-bait overacting , I 'm grateful that `` A Map of the World '' includes recognizable emotional landmass . The fairly simple storyline ... is certainly stretched quite thin over the two hour running time . Gooey with sentiment . An accomplished film that continually takes us beyond our first impressions of people and situations . Scott Elliott 's palsied directorial debut , from a mine shaft-ridden script , is a sick joke . [ A ] imaginative , nimble performance . The film overflows with the studied ordinariness that prevails in Mom movies , where glamorous Hollywood stars muck about in pajamas and a little epiphany may be signaled by a broken cereal bowl on the kitchen floor . 	Disjointed storytelling overshadows noteworthy performances .
downfall There are many lessons to be gleaned from Downfall . Perhaps the most important is that absolute faith in one 's own virtue is not a commitment to virtuous behavior but a commitment to one 's own will . It 's a license to commit atrocities . Gives us the most intimate portrait of Adolf Hitler to date . Its extended running time and the sheer brutality of its subject matter will likely make this film a tough sell for non-hardcore history buffs . It 's reach exceeds its grasp ; nonetheless , a compelling study of Hitler 's last days . Downfall is an admirably matter-of-fact history lesson of a movie , but next to real footage of real people with real memories of those days , it pales by comparison . A blitzkrieg of a story : attacking with full force at a lightning pace . Fascinating as it is , Downfall would have benefited from a tighter perspective . A cinematic 'Gtterdmmerung ... ' ; Hirschbiegel 's film pulls no punches . He neither sugarcoats nor exaggerates . The question of moral culpability raised by the movie is interesting and complex ... a serious and useful film in that it reminds us that the capacity for evil is a human trait . 	Downfall is an illuminating , thoughtful and detailed account of Hitler 's last days .
inside llewyn davis 2013 Beguiling , beautiful , funny and sad , the film is like a luminous time travel ride , taking us deep into the hipster heart of New York 's Greenwich Village , circa 1961 , in the middle of the flowering folk music scene . The Coen Brothers ' remarkable 'Inside Llewyn Davis ' is a conjuring act of near-magical conviction , an ode to the artistic spirit that 's as uncompromising as the troubled genius it chronicles . This is instant A-list Coens ; enigmatic , exhilarating , irresistible . Inside Llewyn Davis is unlike anything the directors have made and is a phenomenal piece of art . It steers away from any kind of sentimentality , so any time serious discussion of success or failure - either commercially or artistically - come up , they are torpedoed like some kind of sick joke . That itself carries a special kind of poignancy . A cold , cruel wind cuts through every frame of this brilliant , mysterious and lyrical black comedy . The Coen brothers ' new movie ranks with their very best in its nearly pitch-perfect balance of biting satirical humour and deep reserves of feeling . A great reminder why Joel and Ethan Coen are such brilliant filmmakers . I just wish the Coens did n't blow it with an ending that is too cute by half . Inside Llewyn Davis is a movie you chew over days after seeing it . Get this movie into your face ! 	Smart , funny , and profoundly melancholy , Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in fine form .
vertical limit Is n't so much a man- versus- nature story as it is an idiots- versus- nature story . Vertical Limit is about as silly as movies come , but the only thing that really counts is whether or not the action sequences are exciting . And they are , in a big way . Mediocre disaster flick . Limit all too often ends up showing the same thing : a disposable , second-string actor clinging to a Styrofoam ledge , looking down at an impossibly deep chasm . There 's a huge surplus of edge-of-your-seat whatevers in this thin-air thriller about a rescue mission on K2 . But by the end , you ca n't tell who 's got more bruises : the actors or your nerves . One of the most thrilling - and authentic - mountain-climbing films in recent memory . More than fills the bill as roller-coaster-ride entertainment . Nearly all , from a gut-crunching helicopter drop to a literal cliff-hanger of excruciating tension , will have you mentally grasping for a lifeline , even if you fail to completely comprehend what 's going on . It 's possible to experience a few white knuckle moments without being in danger of catching frostbite . It looks great , but a weak script , lacklustre acting and silly relationships drag it down . 	The plot in Vertical Limit is ludicrously contrived and cliched . Meanwhile , the action sequences are so over-the-top and piled one on top of another , they lessen the impact on the viewer .
there will be blood Anderson volta a exibir , em Sangue Negro , seu talento para o simbolismo e para opes narrativas intrigantes . Daniel Day-Lewis does an oil maniac in this emotionally drenched gut-slicing and grueling bipolar gore , and what is surely the most grotesque screen image ever of a warped male maternal instinct . Anderson 's most mature and ambitious film yet ... [ though his ] growth as a filmmaker remains hindered by an obsession with effect and a disinterest in depth . There will be blood , indeed Everything about this production is bold from Jack Fisk 's stark period production design to the strikingly discordant score by Radiohead 's Jonny Greenwood . And then there is the towering performance by the unparalleled Daniel Day-Lewis ... Filmmaking at the highest level . ... almost as if Terrence Malick had directed Citizen Kane . A mesmerizing character-study of a ruthless , misanthropic oilman doggedly building an empire in early 20th century California . 'No ! ' is the first word spoken in There Will Be Blood , and it should be the last said in response to Paul Thomas Anderson 's latest pretend epic . This film invaded my consciousness ( literally -- I had a dream about it the first night I saw it , a very rare occurrence ) and still has a tight , daunting grip on it . 	Widely touted as a masterpiece , this sparse and sprawling epic about the underhanded `` heroes '' of capitalism boasts incredible performances by leads Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano , and is director Paul Thomas Anderson 's best work to date .
the order of myths Provides a good feel for the fun and exciting parts of Mobile 's Mardi Gras as well as the undercurrent of `` traditional '' racial segregation that still exists today . [ A ] beautifully restrained , intelligent documentary about how complicated race relations can be in the modern South . Smartly edited , utterly engrossing , and as intelligent an examination of American race relations as I 've seen . To say each group takes this tradition seriously can in no way convey the absolute nuttiness and frenzy that filmmaker Margaret Brown has captured . Order of Myths looks good , and its characters are memorable . Brown presents a complex , provocative view ... A good time is had by all even in light of public displays of racial segregation in the Mobile , Alabama 's Mardi Gras celebration . Ostensibly about Mobile , Alabama 's annual Mardi Gras tradition , which dates back to 1703 , Margaret Brown 's documentary is actually an examination of the racial divide in a city that claims there is none . In The Order of Myths , just as in Manderlay , the legacy of slavery lingers on far past its historical moment . Entertaining , mind-opening docs open every month , but none has broken through to a wide audience . Now comes the latest winner , Margaret Brown 's penetrating The Order of Myths . 	More than a documentary about the oldest Mardi Gras celebration in the south , Order of Myths encompasses the eccentric characters of Mobile and the still-lingering racial tensions that surround them .
mr holmes Mr. Holmes may not feature virtuoso displays of deductive prowess . Its elegiac ode to aging , however , is no less compelling than the more youthful reimaginings of Holmes , of which there have been so many of late . Toggling seamlessly between the older and elder Holmes , a perfectly cast Ian McKellen is the gleaming centrepiece here , with director Bill Condon being careful to make him the best piece of period detail in the film . A tender deconstruction of Holmes and of the process of crime solving . Ian McKellen was surely made to play Sherlock Holmes -- that lanky figure and cultivated voice are ideal for the deerstalker hat , the pipe , and the highbrow cogitating . Sir Ian is a pleasure to watch , though the drama is n't as compelling as it might have been . Mr Holmes should have been incredible but instead it was just ordinary . And I 'm not sure how hard you realise it was NOT to use an 'elementary ' pun . If you 're up for something slow , steady , muted , and nicely acted , Mr. Holmes might be up your alley . Director Bill Condon and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher are clueless , and come up with an incoherent , implausible , contrived mishmash . Stories about mythic figures at the end of their days are compelling - but they still need some zing . That 's what `` Mr. Holmes '' is missing . Great performance in a thin mystery . 	Mr. Holmes focuses on the man behind the mysteries , and while it may lack Baker Street thrills , it more than compensates with tenderly wrought , well-acted drama .
knocked up Knocked Up never stops being funny , but after a while it eases into a profound commentary about commitment , sacrifice and the life-changing results of one fleeting mistake . With equal measures of raunch and sentimentality , Knocked Up explores the minefield of imminent parenthood for two people who do n't know each other very well . A sex comedy with a large heart and a generous spirit , Judd Apatow 's Knocked Up is a thrilling piece of work - a character-driven story rooted in adult reality that 's the funniest film since , uh , what ? Maybe ... ever . A surprisingly sincere look at male-female Mars-Venusness in these 00s . It 's funny alright , but not in the way you might think . One of the best scenes in the film belongs to Harold Ramis as Ben 's dad . When Ben goes to his father with concerns about his own impending fatherhood , the two share a lovely heart to heart . an ( almost ) across-the-board crowd-pleaser . There 's a reasonable amount of risque humor to pacify those who love gross-out gags and enough of a love story to satisfy viewers looking for a good romance . Knocked Up is an ambient , funny movie more devoted to enjoying the journey of its characters ' world than it is bothered with its destination . The one-liners are sustained throughout the entire 132 minutes . It is not easy to walk that tightrope between clever , witty , insightful humor and bawdy farce , but Apatow seems to walk it with ease . A hilarious family values flick which manages to convince you that it 's possible to transform a misogynist into a doting father on the guilt of an unplanned pregnancy . 	Knocked Up is a hilarious , poignant and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing , with a sometimes raunchy , yet savvy script that is ably acted and directed .
mighty heart A breathless and compelling cinematic experience . This is a filmmaker who respects his audience enough to let us decide for ourselves , and Jolie likewise shows us respect by playing Mariane without overblown affectation . The overriding tone of A Mighty Heart is neither indignant nor sentimental : The film is consistently cool . The movie 's frantic bustle releases into an explosion of grief when Mariane finds out what we already know . The film 's strict avoidance of exploitation and sensationalism only adds to the film 's emotional impact . A mighty performance in an average movie . The sheer force of the story , fueled by the commitment and passion of Winterbottom and his cast , counts for a lot . And in a season of superheroes , sequels and special effects , a smart movie for smart people is always welcome . Winterbottom wants to create a you-are-there , semi-documentary-style environment , which does n't leave any room for self-indulgent star turns . Jolie does n't give him one ... Angelina Jolie gives one of the most commanding and moving performances of her career . Topical , worthy and well made , A Mighty Heart fumbles the ball due to a complete dearth of tension and a flat-as-a-pancake performance from Jolie . 	Angelina Jolie conveys the full emotional range of a woman in a desperate situation in A Mighty Heart , an urgent yet tactful film about a difficult subject .
cooler A decent exercise in plain old-fashioned storytelling ; unfortunately , the story itself is pretty cheesy . There 's much to admire , but it 's overwritten , with too many speeches that burden the characters with unnecessary backstories ... While everything works on a superficial , plot-driven level with Bernie and Natalie , there is a broader theme at work that adds depth not frequently found in this genre . Baldwin 's bad-dude turn is devilishly good , and Macy gives a great sad-sack performance . The hottest movie lovemaking of the year . Alec Baldwin handcrafts a ruthless icon . A smart , engrossing story with the right balance of down-and-dirty grit and tongue-in-cheek wit . The Coolermay be all about losers , but there 's no doubt this quirky gem is a winner . If strong performances intrigue you , gamble on this one . First-time director Wayne Kramer makes the odd choice of taking this premise seriously , which forces the actors to work overtime selling hackneyed plot twists . The Cooler is smooth as fine scotch poured over ice baby ! 	A small movie elevated by superb performances .
halloween h2o Halloween : Twenty Years Later has forgotten the wellspring from which it flows . The movie was competently staged by director Steve Miner , and the actors were fine . It held my interest throughout . It 's just that this story has worn itself out from the retelling . Kevin Williamson 's Scream knockoffs aside , none of the endless parade of multisequel , blood-splashin ' horror schlock has lived up to the high-quality , low-budget fright-filled fun of the original Halloween . Until now . I 'm currently stuck watching the revival of a movie form that appalled me the first time around , then disappeared from view after a torrent of thoughtless re-workings that resembled bloody tape loops . Cinema 's most famous scream queen is back , louder than ever , but now infused with a strong dose of Girl -- make that Grrrl -- Power . Though too conventional to be truly thrilling , Halloween H20 is a fitting final round for one of screen history 's bloodiest family feuds . Halloween H20 is a solidly crafted , chilling piece , a suspenseful collage of well-mounted set pieces that will have audiences transfixed . If you 're a Halloween fan , you 're probably over 30 , and this film will suit you -- you need your sleep . While family counseling might have worked wonders for other siblings in similar situations , Laurie and Michael prefer to resolve their differences with big knives , heavy machinery and the always-reliable fireman 's ax . While Carpenter 's film was all about economy and a skilful use of empty space , Miner 's busy compositions have a cluttered feel that is echoed by superfluous orchestral music . 	Halloween : H2O is the best of the many sequels , yet still pales in comparison to the original Halloween .
big daddy Audiences do n't go to a Sandler movie expecting realism or tricky plotting , they go for laughs , and there are at least a few . Does n't offer any of the quasi-adult charm of Sander 's more recent The Wedding Singer or the wall-to-wall loopiness of last year 's The Waterboy . The movie has a heart , yes , but not a very big one . A triumph of personality over performance and content . Sandler has remarkably little funny to do or say in Big Daddy ! Big Daddy is simply the result of calculated corporate types trying to find an approach that will appeal to as many different demographics as possible . Unrealistic , hard to believe , poorly acted , and technically deficient . Maybe Sandler is outgrowing these sophomoric slacker roles , but then again , why should he ? The underwritten script fails to develop its premise adequately , shifts gears mechanically and comes too easily to a convenient finale . Cheap emotions , sloppy writing . 	Adam Sandler acquits himself admirably , but his charm is n't enough to make up for Big Daddy 's jarring shifts between crude humor and mawkish sentimentality .
1205377-last house on the left Its main goals are to shock , titillate , enrage and otherwise jolt your reflexes , which it does shrewdly and successfully . Iliadis is more visually sophisticated than Craven was in 1972 and works hard to sustain the mood and tension while still hitting the audience with blunt scenes of wincing violence . If you want good revenge read some Shakespeare , if you want blood see a slasher , if you want to waste two hours then visit the last house on the left . Its biggest shock is that there 's much to praise , with a couple of stellar performances complementing the mounting tension and intriguingly twisting narrative . Dennis Iliadis is able to make a cult classic once told , feel relevant and terrifying all over again . I 'm giving it a 2.5 in the silly star rating system and throwing up my hands . Iliadis knows a little something about mounting dread , as his slick camera work is constantly looking just past the brush for something creepy that may or may not be there . That 's about as far as the praise goes for The Last House on the Left . Neither a glimmer of satire nor gram of wit animates Dennis Illiadis ' 109 minutes beside the lake . It has none of the underlying humanity of that other revenge thriller Eden Lake , and by the end I found the experience repulsive and deeply exploitative of its audience 's worst instincts . ... superior [ to the original ] in that it makes clear the conflicting justification and degradation of the retaliation , establishing a grayer level of morality . 	Excessive and gory , this remake lacks the intellectual punch of the 1972 original .
harry potter and the sorcerers stone A thumping good adaptation of the work of a creative genius . Poorly paced and frequently dull . Surefire crowd-pleaser , with a terrific , note-perfect cast and impressive use of special effects . For every flight , the film serves up equal amounts of flattened-out shortfall . Robbie Coltrane , Richard Harris , Zoe Wanamaker and Maggie Smith , to name but a few , all put in an appearance and it is these old hands who are the best aspect of the film . There is such a thing as being too faithful to a novel . Many things that were amusing on the page are laborious and redundant in the film ... but they 're there anyway . Potterrific ! A parte tcnica de Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal impecvel . Fans of the novel will have great fun reliving its adventures , and newcomers will receive a rollicking welcome to its magic-touched realm . I ca n't really say that this film taught me anything about why this character is so loved by so many around the world . 	Being so faithful to the book is both the movie 's strength and weakness . The movie unfolds exactly as written in the book , so there is little room for surprises or discoveries . For Potter fans , what more can you ask for ?
fantastic four 2 rise of the silver surfer In Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer , our heroes get what they deserve : a decent action flick with a jolt of visual wow . The same kind of lightweight but well executed comic book-based romp as its predecessor . As was the case with the inept 2005 original , the sequel is a shallow , shoddy , slap-dash mess of ideas and performances . You do n't walk out of Rise of the Silver Surfer feeling as if you 've gone three rounds with the Thing . This is a case where getting less than you bargained for feels like a victory . It does n't suck . Or maybe I went into the theater with such low expectations that it could n't possibly be as bad as my imagination had concocted . Of all the Marvel-spawned screen franchises , the Fantastic Four is the most puerile , reducing as it does this smartly quirky comic book quartet to a fourth-grade primer in dysfunctional family psychology . They should have called Galactus Twistus instead because he appears as a left-over special effect from Twister . . . Suddenly the Surfer , erstwhile intergalactic villain , is made into a Guantnamo-like victim . The image gives brief pause , suggesting that distraction by trivial , tabloidy celebrity events allows terrible injustice to prevail . Not to worry though : the Four Maybe it has something to do with seriously diminished expectations , but Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer is an improvement of sorts over the lifeless 2005 edition . Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer is more ambitious than its predecessor . It 's also more cluttered and less fleet : The light , pleasingly casual quality of the first picture has evolved into something forced and metallic . 	While an improvement on its predecessor , Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer is nevertheless a juvenile , simplistic picture that has little benefit beyond its special effects .
the grand budapest hotel Anderson works so assiduously to create obsessively detailed on-screen worlds that the effect has sometimes been hermetic , even stifling . `` The Grand Budapest , '' however , is anything but . The success of Anderson 's admirable ambition is to have elevated anachronism , pastiche , personal passions and larger cultural memory to a heady froth , but one that also knows the butt-end of a rifle . It is a film that maintains its illusion with grace-and ruefully unmasks that illusion every bit as gracefully . In the end it 's Fiennes who makes the biggest impression . His stylized , rapid-fire delivery , dry wit and cheerful profanity keep the movie bubbling along . Here 's to further Fiennes-Anderson collaborations . Like the eye-catching cakes Agatha makes , Wes Anderson 's eighth feature has a heft beneath its icing , heart behind its artifice . Check in , and you wo n't want to leave . Eloquent , offbeat and charming , The Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson 's most accomplished film to date . A clockwork wedding cake , a caper movie sprinkled with pixie dust , a picture that sends you scrambling for clever metaphors and failing to find them . This beautiful film is at its best when it so delicately underscores one of its major ideas , that of learning to let go of a past - a romantic way of life , a virtuous belief system , genteel traditions and rituals - in order to move on with the present . [ Anderson 's pictures are ] comical without actually being funny , inventive without being freely playful , momentous without being dramatic . The emotional oxygen that would ignite them gets smothered in self-conscious cleverness . Wes Anderson has outdone himself , proving to be the reigning Mother of Invention . 	Typically stylish but deceptively thoughtful , The Grand Budapest Hotel finds Wes Anderson once again using ornate visual environments to explore deeply emotional ideas .
1226860-losers Proving that ensemble chemistry can make or break a franchise , The Losers redeems itself with comedic camaraderie delivered by a well-chosen batch of rising stars . ... an aggressively middle-of-the-road revenge thriller ... The real losers are those folks tricked into forking over good money to see this dumbed-down adaptation of the popular comic book . The movie gets the job done , and the actors show a lot of confidence in occupying that tricky middle ground between controlled satire and comic overkill . It 's fun . As mindless fun in the mold of mid-'80s action ( comparisons to The A Team movie arriving in June are inevitable ) , The Losers delivers the goods . No more , no less . Raucous and colourful , this comical action flick should be great fun , but a lack of plot or character development keep it from coming together . And it 's not actually that funny or exciting . Like most action films , the movie starts strong . However , once the audience gets past the first few explosives , there is nothing left but pieces of a charred plot . These guys are the XY chromosome equivalent of a boy band , each member with quirks , awesome proficiency , and a call sign name like the extras from `` Top Gun . '' It occupies the middle ground between sincerity and sarcasm , not exciting enough to be taken seriously and not funny enough to laugh at . Aptly named , flamboyant and frustrating , it 's silly , hollow , mindless mayhem adhering to the proposition that anything worth doing is worth over-doing , including setting up for a sequel . 	The Losers is loud , fast , and unrelentingly violent -- but it 's also funny and well-acted , which will make all the difference for some action fans .
1194818-encounters at the end of the world Herzog is baffled , amused and fascinated by them all , exults in their palpable strangeness , draws us deep into their unique world and , via Henry Kaiser 's extraordinary underwater photography , what looms often unnervingly beneath it . Damnably frustrating and fascinating , Herzog 's questions deconstruct Earth 's DNA in a scientific process going beyond statistics to ancestry or spirituality - an idea that we 're witnesses and valets who are here and , sooner than we think , will be gone . Herzog , contemporary cinema 's most consistently lyrical examiner of the ( in ) human condition , returns to the documentary form in yet another wonderfully improbable locale : Antarctica , the literal bottom of the world . Caustically enchanting Gosh , Werner Herzog , would you like a little movie to go with your 99-minute , rambling lecture on Antarctica ? A freakshow of social dysfunctions and wild-eyed blue-sky ventures . If you just have to see another Antarctica documentary , you could do worse than Werner Herzog 's Encounters at the End of the World . There 's something highly entertaining , kind of hilarious and almost endearing about director Werner Herzog 's insistence on reacting to each new revelation in his documentary films with a pronouncement of doom ... Unique , striking . This documentary about life in and around a vast scientific research centre in Antarctica . None of these meetings , however , is as interesting as the interspersed footage of the pole 's natural wonders . 	Encounters at the End of the World offers a poignant study of the human psyche amid haunting landscapes .
de rouille et dos 2012 These are people who never would have connected under ordinary circumstances ; they end up needing each other desperately . Only in the movies . Filmmaking this self-indulgent screams `` refund '' in any language . Audiard 's use of genre and clichs is part of a greater argument about moral redemption and deceptive appearances , where happy endings are only skin deep . Cotillard , who 's been waiting since La vie en rose for a role this substantial , is at her damaged , devastating best . Cotillard is always mesmerising and , if you have the patience , Rust and Bone is well worth a look . Despite exceptional cinematography , music , and brilliant performances throughout , the film lacks the believable dramatic arc of director Jacques Audiard 's previous offering A Prophet . This is a sensuously assembled , almost tactile film that earns its redemption and sears itself in memory . You could n't ask for a more random relationship , but `` Rust and Bone '' slowly , almost magically , gives it meaning , symbolism , even a kind of symmetry . The leads save it , particularly Cotillard , who once again subverts her own glamour with ferocious lack of ego . A work of breathtaking intensity , there 's nevertheless a point where so much misery has been thrown on screen that the narrative becomes predictable ; imagine something terrible , and it 's probably going to happen . 	Surging on strong performances from Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts , Rust and Bone is as vibrant and messily unpredictable as life itself .
calle 54 The film will greatly appeal to current fans of the musical genre and should win over more than a few converts . You can find half a dozen things to complain about and yet enjoy every minute of the film completely . The moving moments in Calle 54 are isolated , mainly because Trueba 's approach , while ensuring a killer soundtrack , is too scattershot to satisfy . It 's precisely what a Latin jazz aficionado would want , and what would lead a novice to an affection for the genre . Anyone seeing this happily contagious film will just have to have a copy . Descriptions of great art are , of course , ultimately irrelevant , and Trueba knew we 'd have to experience his passion for ourselves . He 's offering a dazzling invitation -- take him up on it . For much of its 105 minutes , it simply sizzles with sophisticated passion . Calls attention to deserving musicians , but in an oddly cautious style that would fit comfortably onto a PBS fund drive . Trueba 's film captures the flavors of Latin jazz . Even casual listeners will have a hard time not enjoying the often complex sounding and clearly infectious music . 	A loving tribute to Latin Jazz artists where music does the talking .
sunshine superman A bittersweet documentary about Carl Boenish , who looked at very tall things and saw an opportunity to leap . Sunshine Superman captures both the awe and terror of the sport [ Boenish ] loved until the day it brought about his death . ... the existential angle of Boenish 's story ( as well as the unbeatable footage ) elevates Sunshine Superman to a greater height . Strauch makes a compelling case for the exhilaration of living , and dying , on your own terms , a freedom so few of us ever truly experience . `` Sunshine Superman '' might seem like a niche story , with its focus on stunts that most people would n't dream of actually doing , but the documentary feels universal . It 's simply an examination of how one man fully embraced life while charting his own path . First-time filmmaker Marah Strauch skillfully interweaves the Boenish story -- full of copious vintage footage shot by Carl -- with dramatizations and interviews . [ Boenish ] convinced plenty of jumpers to strap cameras to their heads , which resulted in some spectacular footage . Director Marah Strauch gives the film an exhilarating uplift of its own . Long before there were GoPros , there was Boenish , a camera mounted on his helmet , jumping from Yosemite 's El Capitan or L.A. skyscrapers under construction . Boenish 's wife , Jean , who trained to jump with him , is interviewed extensively , and , although Strauch does n't provide much backstory for her , she emerges as that rarity -- a perfect matchup to a seemingly unmatchable man . 	Sunshine Superman shines a light on a fascinating life with copious amounts of incredible , thrilling footage .
daughter from danang The filmmakers do not flinch in the face of emotions almost too great to watch . Smartly directed by Pat Paulson and Michael John Warren and nicely lensed , the material sufficiently establishes the rarefied air Jay-Z occupies . Maybe Thomas Wolfe was right : You ca n't go home again . While billed as 'an intimate look ' at Jay-Z , the film reveals next to nothing about him beyond the fact that he possesses a formidable ability to spin and remember lengthy rhymes , however vulgar and reductive their content . The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma . The movie has the good sense to stay focused on the music . That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . Against a vibrant , well-lit backdrop , he performs his biggest hits with an intensity and clarity that should allow even the uninitiated to appreciate the lyrical dexterity which makes him the genre 's dean , the first rapper profiled on 60 Minutes . Much as with official corporate send-offs , the excitement of this documentary builds steadily for about five minutes and then , before you know it , there 's nothing left to see . Though Fade to Black veers into vanity-production territory at such moments , it mostly is a triumph of stagecraft and speaker-blowing freestyling . 	An emotionally wrenching portrayal of a family reunion that does n't turn out as expected .
van helsing This is n't a horror movie , it 's a sensory assault , full of flaming fireballs and shrieking banshees that make your eyes and ears feel as jeopardized as a vampire at sunrise . Bring your earplugs because this ungodly mess is as painfully loud as it is mind-numbingly stupid . Next time I attend a Stephen Sommers ' film , I 'll bring along a game pad . At least then I can pretend to be controlling the non-stop , noisy and characterless action . Sommers is just painting by numbers . The other wrench tossed into the monster definitions mix is Frankenstein , into whose hideout Van Helsing and Anna accidentally and literally tumble . A shrieking bore . stop asking questions or you 'll miss yet another CGI Van Helsing figure being thrown through yet another CGI wall . Expect big box-office numbers and a merchandising blitz from Van Helsing -- just do n't expect a story or any semblance of logic . A fun , action-packed , highly interesting movie . Far too much of the film feels like drudgery . 	A hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload .
godzilla 2000 [ Godzilla ] deserves better than this overripe afterthought . Once again , Godzilla delivers , cheese and all , in a stylistic B-movie with teeth . Just nuthin ' special A lovably amusing foray into vapid plotting , bad dubbing and men in rubber suits trashing miniature sets . Low production values , high camp and a guy in a giant rubber reptile suit rampaging through a detailed miniature of Tokyo , knocking down buildings , kicking cars and breathing fire ! Yeah , that 's the stuff ! If you can slog through the endless exposition leading up to it , the climactic wrestling match over the latest scale model of Tokyo provides the summer 's best guilty pleasure . So many howlers are uttered ( in badly dubbed English ) in Godzilla 2000 -- the 23rd movie starring that durable beast from the East -- that it 's easy to lose count . Can a movie packed with cheesy acting , cheesy dialogue , cheesy effects and a cheesy plot actually = a good movie ? Yup ! It is exactly what you would expect . The absurd and often pretty violence of the film 's long climax can leave you smiling , though this sort of pop regurgitation is getting old . 	Godzilla 2000 is cheesy , laughable , and good entertaining fun .
beat that my heart skipped This is character-driven film noir , where the violence serves a higher purpose than shocking or titillating an audience . Duris fills the role with enough sympathy to make the film decent , albeit not as good as it should have been . Easy to overlook , and will probably be easy to forget A French film that takes the hard-boiled poetics of American noir and squeezes them into an explosive , compacted knot of anguish and violence . Like any remake , it lurks in the shadow of its predecessor . The conceit of a strongarm hoodlum doubling as a concert pianist seemed really silly to me back in 1978 , and it seems no less silly today . Audiard has wisely avoided the crime-movie clichs of Toback 's Fingers , and if his film is not exactly naturalistic , it is steeped in a reality that makes it all the more compelling . Do n't skip this Beat . Relying on the enigmatic and sultry charisma of Romain Duris , The Beat My Heart Skipped is a mesmerising portrait of a man torn by two very different sides of his personality . With this film Jacques Audiard proves that rotten movies are n't the sole province of Hollywood ... 107 minutes of pure tedium . 	Stylish and visceral , this able remake is infused with realism , grit , and a taut performance by star Romain Duris .
big mommas like father like son 2011 An assessment of the film as part of a dissertational examination of Lawrence 's contribution to comedic posterity and to African-American cultural history will surely note that the film was not pre-screened for critics in advance . Aside from providing the inspiration for 30 Rock 's fake Tracy Jordan movie Honky Grandma Be Trippin ' , it 's hard to see the value of this sporadic Martin Lawrence-wears-a-fat-suit-and-a-dress saga . [ This ] extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichs . A mashup of 'Some Like It Hot ' ( leering rooster-in-the-henhouse voyeurism ) and 'Glee ' ( peppy musical interludes ) , that , on the plus side , grapples with the potent issue of young black male identity ... It seems fair to point out that of all the cross-dressing comedies of recent decades , none has channeled Some Like It Hot quite so thoroughly . The airless Matthew Fogel-Don Rhymer script makes one long for the snark and sass of Madea . Can there really be a comparative and a superlative for `` unfunny '' ? It does n't make sense to describe this witless , embarrassing third film in the Big Momma franchise as `` the unfunniest '' . It 's amazing really , when you look back at the Big Momma 's House film series , how many major crimes can be solved by dressing up as a fat woman . It would be nice to report that , in the end , Big Mommas : Like Father , Like Son is just innocuous . Instead , it 's rather insidious Agonisingly slow and laughter-free . 	Unnecessary , unfunny , and generally unwelcome , Big Mommas : Like Father , Like Son offers more of the same for fans of Martin Lawrence 's perplexingly popular series .
alex rider operation stormbreaker If Pettyfer approached the material as a teenage James Bond movie , the actors playing the villains approached Stormbreaker as a teenage Austin Powers movie . This is as serious as a heart attack with a Snidely Whiplash/Wile E. Coyote plotline , which is why this fails . A shake 'n ' bake Brit teen-spy actioner , without a smidgeon of originality , humor or involving characterization , Stormbreaker is a high-profile bust . If there 's a pressing need for a teen version of James Bond-style spy tales , it 's not apparent : Twelve-year-olds are already watching the real thing . Bond-for-kids done with some obvious budget restrictions ... Perhaps as a publishing phenomenon the concept works , but on-screen it 's pretty dull , with good actors in bad roles and bad special effects . Teen spy hero makes leap from book to screen . With so much talent involved with this film , the finished product seems like a waste . If they 'd given this kid an umbrella , you could guarantee it would rain . [ Rider 's ] squirrelly film debut amps up Horowitz 's wry humor , putting silliness in unintentional competition with the film 's action and dramatic elements . 	Alex Rider : Operation Stormbreaker is strictly children 's fare , as it lacks originality , excitement , and believabiltity .
127 hours For such a simple concept and arguably limited breadth , Boyle and Franco have excelled with a soul-searching drama that 's as elative as it is stomach-turning . Three years ago , the Onion A.V . Club ran a list of great films that are too painful to watch twice . That list has a new Number One . The chaotic scenes with the frenzied , irritating and loud music did nothing to allow us to know Ralston . That 's the movie I wish I 'd seen . Not a film to be viewed lightly . It is the stuff of myth told in a modern vernacular , harsh , exuberant , and ultimately life-changing A estratgia visual tumultuada , embora torne a narrativa mais dinmica , eventualmente acaba tambm diluindo sua fora . Franco single-handedly makes 127 Hours worth watching , but there 's too much manufactured drama here for it to be anything more than an interesting , superbly-acted experiment that does n't quite get the job done . There is so much inherent drama in the story that Boyle 's whiz-banging feels unnecessary and disrespectful . While I was n't as completely impressed with this film compared to some of Boyle 's past offerings ( and especially his last one ) , it 's still quite good . ( Parental Review also Available ) 127 Hours is more entertaining than it has any right to be . Director Boyle and writer Beaufoy unflinchingly present the surefire horror of this real-life nightmare while making 127 Hours truly uplifting and even entertaining . 	As gut-wrenching as it is inspirational , 127 Hours unites one of Danny Boyle 's most beautifully exuberant directorial efforts with a terrific performance from James Franco .
strangers on a train Quintessential Hitchcock . The prototypical Hitchcock thrill ride . Perhaps none of Alfred Hitchcock 's 1950s films is quite as intense as Strangers on a Train . With typical consummate verve , Hitch unfolds a story filled with twists , turns and dramatic contrasts . To ignore the subtext during the runaway carousel climax is to be absolutely blind . Winds up with a scene in which a merry-go-round goes wild , spins like a pin wheel , and crashes in a gaudy blaze of explosions that no earthly carrousel could touch off . The movie itself is the same way : implausible but intriguing and great fun to ride . ... one of the original shells for identity-inspired mystery thrillers , in which natural human behavior is the driving force behind the true macabre . Hitchcock 's handling of the suspense is deadly effective and a quality cast breathe life into some delicious dialogue . Alfred Hitchcock 's `` Strangers on a Train '' is about weakness crisscrossing with evil , with evil pushing hard for the upper hand . Nobody comes away unscathed . As sleek , taut and breezy an entertainment as Hitchcock ever made , and a nice hinge moment , almost exactly in the middle of the black-and-white and color phases of his American career . 	A provocative premise and inventive set design lights the way for Hitchcock diabolically entertaining masterpiece .
1146572-honeymooners Cedric the Entertainer inhabits Kramden 's role comfortably , but there 's no rage or bite in his acting . Thank God Jackie Gleason and Art Carney died before they could see this . A big-thinking schemer and dreamer like Ralph Kramden was amusing in the quaint days of 1955 . In 2005 , he comes off like a moron . The script ( credited to four screenwriters ) uses a plethora of already-dated urban inside humor that reeks of pandering . A stroll down sitcom memory lane in name only , The Honeymooners seems as if any resemblance to the original TV classic could only be accidental . A couple of bursts of inspired physical comedy notwithstanding , the normally unflappable Cedric ( who also executive-produced ) goes through the film plastered with a how'd-I-get-myself-into-this look on his face -- as does the audience . The comedy wannabe has the lamest , most predictable banter of any recent movie . Never rises above the level of a Friday night network sitcom . The best thing that can be said about the new Honeymooners is that it respects its elders : It plays like an episode of the show . The worst thing is that it plays like an episode of the show . A get-rich-quick picture about a guy with get-rich-quick dreams . The moon may shine high over Ralph Kramden 's New York City , but sights are set depressingly low in the studio schemes of Hollywood . 	This pointless remake of the classic TV series only offers generic characters and gags .
all good things The unsolved crime turns out to be less mysterious than the mind of the killer , nervily portrayed by Gosling as not evil but unaccountably empty . As absorbing and detailed as `` All Good Things '' is , it never manages to levitate beyond tawdry movie-of-the-week voyeurism . While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing , in this odd straddle between fact and fiction , the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale . The film ends up wrestling itself into a corner , though it 's saved by a corrosive central performance from Ryan Gosling and a disconcertingly hypnotic feel . Oscar will not be one of all good things that All Good Things might receive . `` All Good Things '' has the eerie power of a nightmare . The acting occasionally borders on great . The story itself is more than worthy . But none of that comes close to overcoming the misguided pacing and overall lack of depth . Proves disappointingly timid . Andrew Jarecki makes the leap from documentary to feature film and his lack of experience in directing actors shows In his first fictional feature , [ Jarecki ] ca n't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie , so he winds up stranded in between . 	It 's well-acted , and the true story that inspired it offers plenty of drama -- which is why it 's so frustrating that All Good Things is so clichd and frustratingly ambiguous .
i am sam Every device of the movie 's art is designed to convince us Lucy must stay with Sam , but common sense makes it impossible to go the distance with the premise . An almost brutally manipulative piece ... ca n't stand up against the tidal wave of treacle that swells up and swallows everyone in the final reels . A soap redeemed by an astonishing performance by Sean Penn as a mentally challenged adult seeking custody of his 7-year-old daughter . It 's similar to a superficially hip and irreverent , yet fundamentally sentimental , TV show . `` Sam '' gives good melodrama , but pushes too many TV-disease-of-the-week hot buttons . There are many great acting performances in this film , but the shining star is without a doubt Sean Penn . This is not a movie that earns tears ; it takes a plunger and sucks them from our eyelids . This movie is every bit as painful as it sounds . Liberal propoganda crap . We 're in the land of `` minority or disabled people as magical healers , '' and that is never a healthy place to be for too long . 	Not only does the manipulative I Am Sam oversimplify a complex issue , it drowns it in treacle .
machine gun preacher Machine Gun Preacher is a flawed and fascinating movie . In telling a true story , ambiguity can be an asset ; but instead of mapping a middle course , director Marc Foster veers between two kinds of falsehoods . Spectacular scenery fills the screen , courtesy of cinematographer Roberto Schaefer . Definitely a movie with a message , the subject matter and R rated material will find limited audience appeal . In the end it devolves into something disappointingly ordinary , which , given the proven skills and sensibilities of director Marc Forster ... I wonder what Jesus called his favorite firearm ? Despite its gut-wrenching honesty vis -- vis lunacy , religion , and the tricky intersection thereof , Machine Gun Preacher is ultimately undone by its chaotic tone . If anyone was cast to lead the vigilante war against the Sudanese LRA rebels ... it 's Butler - just swap the Spartan 's primitive weaponry for a shooter ... It 's rabble-rousing material , and the final credits , in which we see footage of the real Childers strutting his unedifying stuff , suggest that a documentary would have been the appropriate genre . The Lord may work in mysterious ways , but `` Machine Gun Preacher '' is downright confounding . Sam Childers is such a complicated guy that his life would probably work better as a miniseries than a movie . 	There 's a complex man at the center of Machine Gun Preacher but the movie is too shapeless and emotionally vacant to bring his story to life .
shes all that It 's a pleasing but routine effort . This misbegotten comedy makes Beverly Hills 90210 look like a piercing documentary on high school life . To make matters worse , there 's no trace of originality or freshness here . The tempo of the film does well to cure the unlikely romance with just the right amount of anxiety and the leads -- especially Cook , who is wonderfully promising here -- create an earnestly heartfelt chemistry . Once , just once , I 'd love to see a teen flick that does n't send out a message to young girls that to be acceptable , you have to conform . I liked the artist girl much better before . If you 're a teen and you like MTV 's The Real World , I think you might enjoy this picture . If you 're not a teen , there 's better pictures out there for you . A 'just right ' teen movie -- finally ! There are a few twists in the plot , but it is pretty standard stuff . A formula flick . No surprise here : Laney gets a makeover and turns into a babe-and-a-half . Zack realizes what a manipulative jerk he is , and Taylor returns for the predictable standoff with Laney for his affections . In the parlance of American Bandstand it 's got a good beat and you can dance to it , but that hardly separates it from the rest of the pack . 	Despite its charming young leads , She 's All That ca n't overcome its predictable , inconsistently funny script .
english patient The English Patient is a modern movie that breathes vivid new life into the cliches of old-fashioned motion pictures , recalling a time when movies were graceful , complex and leisurely . The English Patient is a labyrinthine film , with plenty of mysteries and secrets all around , and it is a film not to be missed . A truly adult love story , generally well- crafted if a little uninvolving . Films this good do n't come along very often -- The English Patient is one to savour . The film does n't gather the emotional momentum that would make it compelling as well as impressive . It 's an ambitious film and director Anthony Minghella 's skill lies equally in his screenplay , which delivers explanation only in fragments but keeps us involved for what is an epic running time . The triumph of the film lies not just in the force and range of the performances , but in Minghella 's creation of an intimate epic : vast landscapes mingle with the minute details of desire , and the combination is transfixing . The whole film is permeated with tenderness for its hurt characters , whom Minghella sees as just a small slice in the fellowship of people who love and suffer . As the sensitive Hana , Binoche delivers one of the most incandescent performances I 've ever had the pleasure to watch . Get ready for the great romance of the movie year . 	Though it suffers from excessive length and ambition , director Minghella 's adaptation of the Michael Ondaatje novel is complex , powerful , and moving .
modern times Children will adore the slapstick in this movie . Chaplin 's last silent and the last time he uses his signature character of the Little Tramp . An artist with vision swimming against a tide we know will eventually win . Do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime ? Time has not changed his genius . There can be no better description for Modern Times-or indeed , Chaplin 's career-than the film 's initial title card : `` A story of industry , of individual enterprise-humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness . '' [ Blu-ray ] Charlie Chaplin is the Orson Welles of comedy . One of his funniest silent films is Modern Times , a brilliant spoof on technology that 's more stinging today than back in its 1936 release year . Brilliant Chapling satire with a bit of romance . His last non-talkie . genius It 's the coldest of [ Chaplin 's ] major features , though no less brilliant for it . The mechanical feeding sequence in Modern Times is probably the funniest routine in cinema history . 	A slapstick skewering of industrialized America , Modern Times is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious .
elite squad the enemy within The entire last half hour is just incredibly disingenuous . Its conviction makes it tough to dismiss . The plot is worked out , at times , with a complexity worthy of The Godfather and characters as memorable . Embora continuao de uma produo de sucesso , o filme tem aspiraes muito mais nobres do que apenas arrancar mais alguns trocados do pblico . A thumping modern policier with a social-conscience edge . There is a deep sense of indignation at the core of The Enemy Within , a righteous fury that pelts every cog of `` the system '' like machine-gun fire . It 's a massive improvement on the first film - bracing and tightly wound , in charge of its style , and fuelled by an indignation that makes the blood boil . Has a much surer grip of what it wants to say and has lost some of the troubling fascistic overtones of its predecessor . Hard-hitting Brazilian thriller about police corruption , politics and crime colliding in Rio 's favelas and corridors of power and law enforcement is as intelligent as it is entertaining . Partly compensates for its shortcomings by adopting a deeper , more analytical approach to its portrayal of endemic police and political corruption . 	Elite Squad : The Enemy Within is a bleak , violent descent into the Brazilian underbelly , ripping into the favelas with unstoppable and kinetic force .
cloverfield An engaging thriller that should thoroughly satisfy genre fans during a time of year when their choices are essentially between bad and worse . ... rescues the Godzilla genre from the realm of kitsch . Cloverfield is the most intense and original creature feature I 've seen in my adult moviegoing life , and that 's coming from a guy who knows his Gojira from his Gamera and his Harryhausen from his Honda . Despite the mostly convincing verisimilitude of the approach , the film does succumb , especially in its last act , to some cheap manipulation , one or two bad stereotypes , and some cornball Hollywood schmaltz . When all is said and done , and Cloverfield plays out , we 're left with ... 'a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . ' Viewers prone to motion sickness should bring Dramamine or take through-the-fingers viewing breaks . Otherwise , Cloverfield is a blast . Better than any American monster movie in years . An old-fashioned monster movie dressed up in trendy new threads . A realistic depiction of what it would be like if a giant monster really did attack Manhattan . The photography is jarring , but not as jarring as the realism . There has never been a film of its kind so intense , so personal , so real . 	A sort of Blair Witch Project crossed with Godzilla , Cloverfield is economically paced , stylistically clever , and filled with scares .
hedwig and the angry inch A colorful , high-energy rock show ... But it also has a poignant side . A uniquely entertaining and original work of musical-dramedy invention . Hedwig is a force of nature , burned out and jaded yet brimming with compassion and bursting with energy . Hedwig 's songs stuck with me for days , and somebody will literally have to cause me bodily harm to harvest the soundtrack from my CD player . Mitchell 's performance as Hedwig remains one of the best of modern times -- the character is by turns sexy , scary , outrageous , obnoxious , pitiable and vulnerable -- and it anchors a movie that landed on my list of the 10 best films of the 2000s . The off-Broadway rock musical that pushes off from a botched sex-change operation is sweet dynamite on film . Any movie in which the tranny protagonist can theoretically link Anne Murray and David Bowie in rock history is automatically a work of genius . At heart an old-fashioned barrel-of-fun rock-and-roll musical . I hope I 've managed to lure you to it . While Hedwig occasionally lapses into a kind of pop sappiness , it 's also upfront about all that , declaring its faith in the mythology of love , its capacity to 'create something that was n't there before . ' 	Hedwig and the Angry Inch may very well be the next Rocky Horror midnight movie . It not only knows how to rock , but Hedwig 's story has an emotional poignancy .
the kid with a bike [ VIDEO ] In spite of its all-too-obvious machinations `` The Kid with a Bike '' touches on social ills in a direct fashion without preaching . Young Thomas Doret fills the role with natural sincerity and focus , and not a second that seems contrived . A richly textured and human drama brimming with warmth , tenderness and pure , unadulterated poignancy . Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne return to devastating form with this compelling riff on the Italian neo-realist classic `` Bicycle Thieves . '' The Dardennes ' quiet , naturalistic style strips this story of melodrama but not of emotion . Not much happens in The Kid with a Bike , but it leaves you grateful that the worst does n't happen - with these characters , you might not be able to bear it . ... never soft-pedals the treacherous byways and alternative routes that [ protagonist ] Cyril only narrowly avoids on his road to security and happiness . ... manages to balance a spiritual sense of grace with the earthy eye of a here-and-now realist . It 's a quietly powerful film about redemption that works on multiple levels , thanks in part to its superb performances . [ Thrusts ] adults into the psychology of a child , pushing them into a confrontation with their own self-involvement . 	Thanks to the Dardenne brothers ' typically fine direction , The Kid with a Bike is a heart-wrenching , thematically and spiritually rich drama .
spun This movie is less than zero . Both harrowing and funny , but I 'm not sure the filmmakers would agree with everyone about which scenes are which . Spun is more about exuberant editing providing a humorous glimpse into a small , bored , drug community than a focus on any particular acting or writing talent . Like an ex-addict reminiscing over their days of dependence , it 's dead behind the eyes : hollowed out . A weird speed freak trip comedy that has all the trippers spinning out-of-control . If Spun does n't glamorize the world it surveys , its parade of reeling potty-mouthed clowns ( especially Mr. Rourke 's cowboy chemist ) still exudes a kind of doomy charisma . Madly arranged in one ambivalent , entirely creative work that attempts not only to convey a feeling , but a sense of experience This tale of Southern California speed freaks works too hard for its high . The traumatized critic must struggle to avoid capital letters in urging patrons to steer clear of the colorfully cast but unbearable Spun . Seems to exist for no reason other than to suggest that crystal-meth freaks are really scattered innocents looking for their next consciousness-raising jolt . 	A chaotic drug movie that has little substance behind the stylistic flash .
pulp fiction In terms of mood and style , it could be the most influential film to come along since Blue Velvet . Its dedicated fan-base and the pop-culture reverberations that have flowed steadily from it , almost 20 years on , echo Tarantino 's achievements with Pulp Fiction . Unassailable filmmaking . It 's hard to over sell a movie that is so supremely confident in writing and direction . Pulp Fiction is the best film of 1994 , and of this decade . Pulp Fiction is n't the sleazy work of a shock artist giving us things no one else will put on film . This is the work of someone talented , smart and thrilled to be making movies , giving us things no one else can put on film . Tarantino 's dialogue , with its densely propulsive , almost lawyerly fervor , its peppery comic blend of literacy and funk , has more snap and fight than most directors ' action scenes . Some of its strengths still impress . There 's the trivial-turned-menacing , the gangster-gone-poppy , and the various sadnesses , poignancies , and tragic pointlessnesses that seep out of the best noirs . Samuel L. Jackson is the beating heart of Pulp Fiction , and his performance alone would make this well worth your while . There 's cleverness at work ... but Tarantino 's 154-minute film rambles with nihilist fantasy and pop in-jokes . This is a work of such giddy vitality and unrepentant excess that you 'll not only overlook its flaws ; you 'll be compelled to embrace them . 	One of the most influential films of the 1990s , Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills , pitch-black humor , and pop-culture touchstones .
stone reader It 's an intimate look at the gears inside one person 's head and a study of how an obsession , when handled judiciously , can be enlightening . A remarkable accomplishment , an absorbing documentary about the joy of reading that 's also a positively gripping literary mystery . Loved the discovery , but hated the man 's forcing of himself on the project . Stone Reader 's subject is worthy , and receives a mostly entertaining treatment , but I felt like there was more to gain from the quest than Moskowitz puts on the screen . Occasionally overwrought and overwritten . No insight into its subject matter ( reading , readership , creation ) , but a lot of insight into Moskowitz and the contents of his bookshelf . Just as in a good read , the point is more in the journey than the destination . A unique account of the impact of a work of art on a single man 's mind and spirit . A riveting literary adventure . An unalloyed treasure for any viewer who has ever felt transformed by reading a good novel . 	This fascinating documentary will be of most interest to those who read and write for a living .
what a girl wants Because Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth portray the rambunctious daughter and stuffy father so engagingly , this romantic fairy tale charmed me completely . Bynes proves herself to be quite the comedienne , intertwining a performance of physical shtick and cutesy gesticulation ... uses a dependable formula that 'll definitely deliver `` What a Girl Wants '' It 's fantasy time for the instant gratification generation . There 's nothing wrong with this movie , it just kind of moves along at this little pace , no surprises . As with The Princess Diaries , those in the market for what it has to offer will find it pleasantly agreeable , and those who are n't wo n't be in the theater in the first place . It 's no longer the children who must learn to grow up , but the adults -- exemplified by Mr. Firth 's character as he slips into a pair of leather pants and practices his air-guitar moves -- who are required to grow down . Although there 's nothing for the parents , little girls will like it and that 's what really matters . Though predictable and often preposterous , this warm and funny wish-fulfilling fantasy is a richly rewarding ride . I really did enjoy it , overall , and here 's why : the considerable charm of Colin Firth . What a Girl Wants is exactly what a girl -- specifically a dreamy middle-school girl -- wants . 	Little girls will definitely enjoy it , but it 's too syrupy and predictable for adults .
1208 east of bucharest Porumboiu 's minimalist approach concentrates the movie 's focus on its mournful characters , so disillusioned with their post-Communist life they question the history that led to it . Black comedy with a subtle political edge . Corneliu Porumboiu 's picture would submerge you in alcoholic despair if it were n't so damn funny . ( That seems to be the Romanian mode of expression . ) Dry comedies from eastern Europe tend to cast a skeptical eye on anything and everything , which is certainly the case with Corneliu Porumboiu 's debut feature . Filmed in real time , the unraveling call-in program is a comedy of embarrassment ( The Office , without the asides to the camera , but just as dry ) . The movie provokes low-key laughs ( yes , it 's a comedy ) , but with a sad overtone . Though it is modest , almost anecdotal , in scale , 12:08 East of Bucharest is also characterized by a precise and sneaky formal wit . While 12:08 East of Bucharest could take more than one viewing to truly appreciate , it 's worth the commitment . The only problem with the new Romanian cinema seems to be titles few can easily remember - but some eccentricity is permissible when the films are so good . ... 12:08 East Of Bucharest does n't pretend to have a position on the fallout of the Romanian Revolution . Instead it contends that different questions need to be asked and considered about post-Communist life ... 	With a witty script full of satirical overtones and dry humor , 12:08 East of Bucharest is a thoroughly enjoyable Romanian comedy .
extraordinary measures Even if this feeble film were n't based on a book with a gigantic plot-spoiler title , it would still feel like something you endure more than watch . Not so much directed as processed , hewing closely to the cut-and-dry inspirational template . Fact-based drama about a father 's fight to find a cure for his children 's debilitating disease is intelligent and involving . Extraordinary Measures is so well intentioned no parent could possibly hate it . Rarely , though , has 106 minutes in the company of such big stars felt so long . Harrison ford interview : `` I did n't make this film because I 'm a crusader for righteous health care or I wanted to indict the pharmaceutical industry or to make a film about Pompe disease . I wanted to be fair and entertaining . '' Harrison Ford is always watchable in this otherwise routine tear-jerker . Harrison Ford is the clich ( C ) of a scientist who cares more for equations than humans , and works to atrocious rock music . The child actors are cloying in their cuteness . A serious subject drowned by sentimentality . The road to mediocrity is paved with good intentions . Minus its above-the-name stars and theatrical distribution , it is largely indistinguishable from any number of made-for-TV melodramas Few films on this topic so clearly illustrate the competing agendas and cut-throat capitalism of America 's for-profit health care . 	Despite a timely topic and a pair of heavyweight leads , Extraordinary Measures never feels like much more than a made-for-TV tearjerker .
quinceanera Fast paced and accompanied by a buoyant soundtrack , the film keeps up with the teenagers ' raging hormones . This is a fresh , spirited drama , charming and unpretentious . The film is so appealing and so human ( at least when it keeps its focus ) that it 's hard to resist its charms . Pleasing yet amateurish drama . A funny , moving drama that manages to seamlessly blend a smart coming-of-age story with a hard look at gentrification . [ Has ] courage to look realistically , instead of idealistically , at some dubious civic practices ; and second , honesty about the painful feelings of kids coupled with their desperate need for love and guidance and their ultimate desire to do the right thing . Life-affirming without being saccharine and enormously entertaining . Principals Emily Rios , Jesse Garcia and Chalo Gonzalez bring affecting authenticity to this tale of finding 's one place . Quinceaera is n't a work of art , nor does it want to be . But it is a crowd-pleaser . ... smart and irony-free ... 	This slice-of-life story of a teenage girl in Echo Park is both a sweet crowd-pleaser and a perceptive look at socioeconomic community issues .
alpha dog Cassavetes coaxes persuasive performances from Justin Timberlake and Anton Yelchin in this flashy re-creation of a 1999 kidnapping-murder in cushy Southern California , which overdoes the seamy side of suburbia angle . There probably is n't a single character in Alpha Dog you would consider likable or sympathetic . And yet , the film almost works in spite of that . Almost . Director Nick Cassavetes has a blast with scenes of testosterone-fueled aggression ( until it 's time to repent ) , working the subwoofer in a way that 'll surely boost DVD sales among boys with bedroom posters of Tony Montana . It suffers from ADD , but there 's some terrific stuff in here . Leaving 15 minutes from the end and saving yourself a lumbering coda may improve enjoyment . [ Cassavetes ] creates an astonishing amount of tension building towards his 'I-can't-believe-this-is-really-going-to-happen ' climax . Cassavetes ' film is pure Hollywood fiction and sensationalism mixed with some sense of reality , but hell I enjoyed it a great deal ... Calls for more explanation and less posturing . Timberlake walks off with the movie . Too bad it 's not worth stealing . Watching it is like being trapped at the biggest boneheaded gathering of snowballing stupidity you can imagine Alpha Dog operates without outrage -- not because the behavior of the people in the movie is n't horrifying but because the movie knows it is much too late to save those bouncing , happy kids we glimpsed in the opening seconds . 	A glossy yet unflinching portrait of violent , hedonistic teenagers . Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone chew the scenery , while Justin Timberlake gives a noteworthy performance .
looney tunes back in action It 's not a disgrace , but it is a missed opportunity . despite the inspired casting of such human cartoons as Fraser , Martin and Cusack , the live action segments drag the Tunes down It 's flat-out comedy all the way , head-spinningly clever ( you 'll be talking about a sequence set in the Louvre for weeks ) and always engaging . ... neither offensive nor inspiring . It 's undoubtedly fun for kids , but except for its occasional in-jokes there is n't all that much to excite the funny bone of an adult . The leads , Ms. Elfman and Mr. Fraser , as well as most of the other actors , portray clichs with characterizations flatter than Wile E. Coyote after the anvil falls on him . This is n't an imaginative rebellion against the physical world like the old cartoons ; it 's the anarchy of animation , which is n't nearly as fun . The satire becomes unfocused without a driving force behind it , and the adventure is the stuff of which so many movies have touched upon before . Where ( director Joe ) Dante , along with screenwriter Larry Doyle , a former Simpsons writer , succeed is in keeping the animated actors in character . Bursts with energy but not inspiration . It 's one of those films that , as they say , 'has its moments , ' but that does n't really come together as a fully realized whole . 	The plot is a nonsensical , hyperactive jumble and the gags are relatively uninspired compared to the classic Looney Tunes cartoons .
1193230-state of play serviceable entertainment that never makes a strong cinematic statement The film is a veritable litany of torn-from-the-headlines issues , yet they all dovetail nicely within a thriller format . And this is the rare film that sends you out of the theater feeling a bit smarter than when you entered . Director Kevin Macdonald attacks the material with aggression and panache , simultaneously decrying the fading stocks of serious journalism while marking out the shadow zone where government and big business seal their dirty deals . ... a rather conventional political thriller with a terrific cast ... It 's very successful , gripping from start to finish in the way that Michael Clayton almost but not quite did . A busy thriller that moves between the worlds of newspapers and politics , Kevin Macdonald 's State of Play zips along smoothly . State of Play is the best newspaper/journalism movie since Shattered Glass ( 2003 ) . State of Play wants to remind us that good investigative reporters are still out there in a world dominated by gossip sheets and undisciplined bloggers . It 's sentimental in all the right ways . Scottish director Kevin Macdonald specializes in making historic or potentially dry material seem as urgent as an ambulance siren . 	A taut , well-acted political thriller , State of Play overcomes some unsubtle plot twists with an intelligent script and swift direction .
surfwise This documentary about a famous family of nomadic surfers is fascinating not only because of the certifiable oddball patriarch , but also because of his endlessly creative offspring . The film 's director , Doug Pray , has been able to track down each and every Paskowitz child , and he weaves their memories together with old home movies , still photos and news clippings to create an evocative portrait of their lives . Some documentarians think like essayists , propagandists , abstract painters , or magazine reporters . Doug Pray approaches his documentaries as though he 's writing books . The most fascinating parts of the movie explore how the Paskowitz children -- who are now in their 30s and 40s -- continue to adjust to a more 'normal ' lifestyle . When so many documentaries today seem concerned only with arguing a point , it 's nice to see something like this which seeks only to reveal . Intriguing family story of the sunny and dark sides of extreme home-schooling by surfing , through a trove of photos , home movies , and reminiscences , but little insight . Surfwise is a graceful , searching film that seems to have missed no opportunity to reveal truths about parents and children and how they come to understand each other . A provocative documentary about a man who dropped out to follow a dream that gradually evolved into something not unlike a nightmare . The story is essentially Doc 's , but the more compelling aspect of Surfwise is the obvious question : Are the kids dysfunctional or what ? [ Director ] Pray backs away from the unpleasant stuff rather quickly , which seems a little disingenuous . But he 's got a great subject , and when he 's riding it at full throttle the film is absolutely charming . 	An intriguing account of a unique family .
monsieur ibrahim Wry , supple , endearing . Takes a provocative subject -- friendship and love between a Jew and a Muslim -- and makes it seem natural and wondrous . Hardly challenging . A sweet , caring story about the relationship between a Muslim shopkeeper and a homeless Jewish boy . Both lead performances are extraordinary . A gracefully subtle , sweet-spirited French parable of the brotherhood of man . How often do you come across a soothing , unassuming film as gentle as this ? You ca n't take your eyes off the aged beauty of 71-year-old Omar Sharif , who plays the title character in the delicate cross-cultural fable Monsieur Ibrahim with palpable delight . Thanks to Sharif 's performance , this French-language import is made quite watchable . A joyful ode to life . 	With tender , assured performances , Sharif and Boulanger elevate what might have been a rote coming-of-age tale .
piglets big movie With his typical charm and grace , Piglet proves again that great things can come in small packages . Has all the charm of cafeteria creamed spinach . The Carly Simon songs are cute and inoffensive , the colors bright , the message positive and the film short . What more can you ask ? This is harmless fun for the kindergarten crowd , but even they will notice that the Blustery Day video they 've been playing at home is a lot better . Piglet 's Big Movie is an agreeable , if fitfully entertaining , introduction to Milne 's characters . But it 's no substitute for going by the book . A summer-holiday movie for very little kids . Piglet 's Big Movie complements ( rather than detracts from ) the much-loved originals . Piglet 's Big Movie is what might be called second-rank Disney animation [ but it ] works , the kids will like it , and it provides a little escape from the news . While nowhere near as captivating as ABC 's `` The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , '' this is a pleasant enough family diversion . There are sweet turns that make the journey worthwhile . 	Wholesome and charming entertainment for young children .
secret in their eyes Writer-director Juan Jose Campanella is a master of camerawork and editing . He is also wonderful with actors . There is n't a false performance here . This complex and involving Argentinean crime drama , with strong moral overtones , won the Best Foreign Language Oscar . This beautiful film , directed with subtlety and grace by Juan Jos Campanella , really is about moving from fear to love . The compelling story plays out like a page-turning suspense novel that you ca n't put down . The acting is superb and the camera lingers on the actors ' faces in.. They even nail a cliche like saying goodbye at a train station . Great thriller , romance and most importantly , film . Campanella achieves impressive balance in a genre not typically known for subtlety . Darn 's central performance is a consummate lesson in minimalist acting , deftly bypassing the tropes of the clichd romantic lead and the crusading good guy . ... what might have been just a two-hour episode of Law and Order : Argentina is instead a rich , literary tapestry . ... I wish this could become a franchise . A supremely watchable , well-made and well-acted movie with a dark , sinewy sense of history ... ... a top notch film , a poignant love story and a mystery that reverberates across decades and different political climates . 	Unpredictable and rich with symbolism , this Argentinian murder mystery lives up to its Oscar with an engrossing plot , Juan Jose Campanella 's assured direction , and mesmerizing performances from its cast .
csa the confederate states of america CSA is rough around the edges , especially where the acting and some of the film 's invented characters are concerned . But the way CSA works out its ideas is so provoking that its drawbacks are not difficult to ignore . Willmott spends a great deal of energy inventing details for the pulsing flow of his phony history , and some of his invented logic eerily mirrors some of the today 's school of thought . The most alarming thing about C.S.A . : Confederate States of America is how utterly unalarming it seems . The satire comes to feel strained and the whole premise gets awfully precious , reducing social subtleties to cinematic simplicities . As funny as it is provocative , this is a startling film on every level . There are droll comic flourishes in this very brave film , to be sure , but all you really want to do after watching CSA is hang down your head and cry . Its attack on American racist capitalism is provocative , disturbing and powerful satire . . . shows us through fiction what Katrina has already revealed in fact . interesting , though very melodramatic This provocative , deeply unsettling mockumentary from filmmaker Kevin Willmott offers an alternate history of America based on a terrifying what-if scenario . Its central notion is so very promising that Willmott 's failure to properly run with it only compounds the eventual disappointment . 	Through the eyes of a British `` documentary '' , this film takes a satirically humorous , and sometimes frightening , look at the history of an America where the South won the Civil War .
tango and cash Stallone and Russell play well off each other , and with Palance lurking in the background , this buddy-breakout never loses its way . Full of stupid A-Team-style action . A forerunner of today 's braindead action films . A party gathering and a few drinks and your night could be set . Sober practicality , however , may get the better of you though as you wade through mysogyny , racism and homophobia . Movies like this are annoying because they seem to be saying that the audience is made up of morons . This form of self-conscious action filmmaking is smeared over both Stallone and Russell . They mug mercilessly ( none too well ) and , of course , they rely on plenty of bang and firepower to disguise a sour and often nasty script . Both men think that the best way to deliver the right to remain silent to the usual suspects is via a right hook . Stallone has just enough moxie to make this watchable . Russell is n't so bad , either . An awful , smug , monster truck of a movie . A mindless buddy cop pic , loaded with nonstop action that 's played mostly for laughs and delivers too few of them . The result is great , brainless fun . 	Brutally violent and punishingly dull , this cookie-cutter buddy cop thriller is n't even fun enough to reach `` so bad it 's good '' status .
blair witch project The Blair Witch Project taps into primitive beliefs about the supenatural in a way not tried before by traditional filmmakers . An instant classic . It is very good at capturing the genuinely creepy fears that everybody has about being lost in the woods . In it 's own modest , seemingly artless way , `` The Blair Witch Project '' is the most genuinely scary movie to creep across screens in years . Scary without being explicit , it 's a 1990s cinematic landmark , and best judged away from the hype . This may not be a masterpiece , but it 's a refreshing digression from the pretension that indie filmmaking tends to represent and from the horror movie clichs that make this movie 's companions so dull . What becomes especially impressive about Blair Witch is how relentlessly it sticks to its vision . The Blair witch cast a spell on the audience and we loved every minute of it . No film in recent memory has shocked me , petrified me , unsettled my spirits , and left me so enthusiastic afterwards ! Ballsy filmmaking . 	Full of creepy campfire scares , mock-doc The Blair Witch Project keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain -- thus proving that imagination can be as scary as anything onscreen .
paper The picture starts to fall in love with its subject -- head- over-heels in love , until the acid drains from the wit and there 's nothing left but sentimental ooze . A film that should be recommended as skillfully done example of almost forgotten dramatic subgenre . Watching The Paper got me in touch all over again with how good it feels to work at the top of your form , on a story you believe in , on deadline . It 's clear right away that The Paper benefits substantially from Keaton 's typically stellar turn as the central character ... It 's all slick , fizzy fun . But the film 's fighting spirit gets snatched . The characterizations , the eccentricities , the feverish sense of pursuing a deadline story and an awful lot of other particulars that show just how defiantly dedicated and frenetically frenzied the members of the fourth estate can be , are dead on . An overwrought , hysterical drama about the newspaper business that does n't begin to compare to Hollywood 's classics of the genre ( The Front Page ) . The film has an absurdly frantic pace but it 's so romantically naive and unsubtle that nothing registers Not a bad view of the inner-workings at a daily Does it show how newspapers really work ? Not really , but who cares ? It is great fun , even if it is overdone . A crowd pleaser , and , regardless of any viewer 's experience ( or lack thereof ) with the behind-the-scenes wrangling that goes on in newspaper offices , the story is affable and entertaining . 	Fast and frenetic , The Paper captures the energy of the newsroom thanks to its cast and director on first-rate form .
last picture show Moving , understated , beautifully filmed story with memorable acting by all . It is difficult to know where to stop in listing the really outstanding performances -- Cloris Leachman , Ben Johnson , Timothy Bottoms , Eileen Brennan , et al . This episodic , human story lives and breathes with more power than any Darth Vader or Rocky . A poignant evocation of small-town life in fifties Texas . Peter Bogdanovich 's eerie homage to olden times and movies , one of the key Hollywood films of the early 1970s , looks ever more crisply stunning and remote . The film is above all an evocation of mood . It is about a town with no reason to exist , and people with no reason to live there . The only hope is in transgression . A lot of films bill themselves as 'Classics ' , but here 's one that actually deserves the title . As entertaining today as it was in 1971 . Unmissable . The Last Picture Show is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made ( although I hardly think the scorekeepers were waiting for my vote to come in before they declared it such ) . Its portrait of a floundering community is the film 's strongest virtue . 	Making excellent use of its period and setting , Peter Bogdanovich 's small town coming-of-age story is a sad but moving classic filled with impressive performances .
rugrats movie Intermittently snappy and featuring slicker animation than its TV incarnation , this popular children 's cartoon may satisfy its youngest fans , but it 'll be a big snoozefest for the rest of the family . Very slow kids movie . I just never got into it . Diaper-loads of fun . Bored me silly . Really silly . I think it 's nothing short of shockingly irresponsible . The result is surprisingly watchable for kids and adults alike , producing only minimal fidgeting . It 's a fun-filled oddity among G- rated animated movies . But some folks may conclude that the babies ' creators have gone off the deep end to satisfy a '90s sensibility that favors edgy entertainment . As mentioned , there is a good message to the film ( one about accepting family members for whom they are ) , and the pacing is brisk enough so young audiences wo n't get bored . Television 's most popular children 's show successfully toddles to the big screen , offering all the sass and cuteness that Rugrats fans expect -- and more . The result is a happy blend of smart-aleck humor and wacky adventure . 	Charming characters ; loads of fun for kids and adults .
i love you phillip morris Jim Carrey gives one of the nerviest , boldest performances of his sporadically brilliant career . Another fantastic performance by Carrie , not be mention McGregor . Living proof that the only difference between fact and fiction is that fiction has to make sense . Laugh-out-loud funny at moments and surprisingly touching in others , I Love You Phillip Morris has the potential to be a dark horse contender come awards season . An amusing , frustrating and wildly uneven comedy farce that I just ca n't imagine is going to play well to most anyone but a number of film critics who might admire the pic 's derring-do . ( Parental Review also Available ) Jim Carrey succeeds but the film is too mean-spirited and its supporting players too one-dimensional to make this story worthwhile . Such an endearing oddity that you have to wonder exactly for whom it was made . But I 'm glad they did nonetheless . Laugh-out-loud hilarious one moment and darkly tragic the next , I Love You Phillip Morris ' tone is wildly uneven , never quite sure of what sort of movie it wants to be-and I loved it for it . An amusing and weirdly affectionate ride . Anyone want to sign up for the Free Steven Russell movement ? sort of like a darker , weirder Catch Me If You Can The movie , at its best , is compellingly odd , which is also the most accurate description of Carrey 's performance . 	This fact-based romantic comedy has its flaws , but they 're mostly overcome by its consistently sweet , funny tone and one of the best performances of Jim Carrey 's career .
mosquito coast Weird and smoothly engaging . Harrison Ford does some great ( non-hero ) work here . It 's a testament to Ford 's talent that we actually care what happens to him , because in a lesser actor 's hands , we 'd be hoping that some cannibalistic natives would eat him . A stretch for Ford , but worth it . Unique and fascinating character study . one of the most underseen guy movies ever Examines the consequences of a father 's egotism on his family . It 's easy to forget how well Harrison Ford can play an unlikable character . Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances in this underrated film . Meandering film that does n't really seem to know where it 's going or what it is . 	Harrison Ford capably tackles a tough , unlikable role , producing a fascinating and strange character study .
roman holiday The Paramount crew that worked on Roman Holiday reminded me of expert marksmen who had made `` charm '' their target and seldom if ever missed it . Mr. Wyler and his associates have fashioned a natural , tender , and amusing yarn about the heiress to the throne of a mythical kingdom who is sick unto death of an unending schedule of speeches , greetings , and interviews attendant on her goodwill tour ... [ An ] unfailingly lovely fairy tale . Director William Wyler delivers some of the most stunning black and white visions of Rome ever put on film . Considering how many eye-filling extravaganzas have been set in the eternal city , that 's really saying something . The newcomer named Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before . Hepburn and Peck revel in their shared duplicity but almost take a backseat to the splendour of the Italian capital , which has rarely been given so much lens-love since . Nice little bittersweet comedy Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar and popular acclaim in this story of a princess who breaks free of the palace and has a fling with Gregory Peck . A lovely film . A lovely little romance , full of fun and playfulness , stellar performances ( Hepburn won an Oscar and Albert was nominated ) , and all set against the beauty of Rome 	With Audrey Hepburn luminous in her American debut , Roman Holiday is as funny as it is beautiful , and sets the standard for the modern romantic comedy .
the story of the weeping camel This first-ever film in the Mongolian language is a masterpiece , a simply told story of a two-humped Bactrian camel and its calf and the family in whose keeping they thrive . A modest pleasure - a quiet little oasis in the blockbuster desert . To Read review visit www.EmanuelLevy.com A joyous movie . ... plays out like a naturalistic fable in an austere , timeless land in which ancient traditions co-exist with modern technology . Strangely moving film . A window on a changing world most of us will never see . This wonderful Mongolian film is a total delight from start to finish ; it speaks volumes about the ties that bind human beings and animals together . The vivid fictional specifics , and the simple loveliness of the artless performances by nonactor Mongolian nomads , attest to the filmmakers ' abundant artistry . A simple tale of animal estrangement and reconciliation that in its own quiet way manages to be soothing , hypnotic , even magical . 	Delightful and strangely moving .
phoenix 2015 Combines naturalism and the quasi-fantastical into an assured , confident dirge . Phoenix has a plot that hangs on the edge of believability but injects enough tension at the right moments to keep the film from tripping over itself . [ I ] t 's engrossing enough to keep the doubts about the story itself at bay . Phoenix mines a Hitchcockian vein , but it is Hoss ' sensitive performance and Petzold 's intelligently paced direction that makes this film shine . A flawed human canvas candidly divides the characters into people facing brutal moral realities they can not transcend . While some go along to get along or succumb to identification with the oppressor , or immense heartbreak relieved by self-obliteration . An ingeniously plotted and rather heartbreaking movie ... Petzold 's best film , and an early contender for one of the year 's finest . There 's no point in explaining where all of this goes . But Petzold is in command of it . The warped narrative functions as an allegory for the stories that people and nations recount to themselves in order to go on surviving . A noir-ish and complex emotional thriller . 	Tense , complex , and drenched in atmosphere , Phoenix is a well-acted , smartly crafted war drama that finds writer-director Christian Petzold working at peak power .
breathless Even if some of Breathless remains inaccessibly arty and obtuse , it 's nonetheless a film of watershed importance . Breathless feels like it was [ made ] tomorrow . Breathless became a kind of existential hipster classic , a cool flick as well as great cinema . It stands apart from all that came before and has revolutionized all that followed . The film that launched the French New Wave , Breathless remains an outstanding testament to the great ideals of fun filmmaking that infused the movement . It retains its brilliance both as entertainment and as a groundbreaking work of art . Decades later , this seminal work of the French New Wave is still one of Godard 's freshest , most innovative , and most accessible films with a stunning performance by Jean Paul Belmondo channeling Bogart . One of the most famous and influential movies ever made . Regardless of how one feels about Jean-Luc Godard 's later , less accessible works , it would be hard to find a more audacious debut feature . On its fiftieth birthday Breathless remains fresh and exciting , although its revolutionary approach has long since been absorbed into the mainstream , and the years do show on it a bit . 	Breathless rewrote the rules of cinema -- and more than 50 years after its arrival , Jean-Luc Godard 's paradigm-shifting classic remains every bit as vital .
case 39 Ferland 's fine performance aside , Case 39 is bafflingly stupid and poorly executed sub-horror fodder . ... the scares go top-notch thanks to a creepy performance by young Jodelle Ferland . Not as bad as I was expecting . A soulless amalgamation of several horror classics , and marks another dud in the career of Renee Zellweger . Directed by Christian Alvart ( Pandorum ) with a less than giddy hand , Case 39 is truly terrible . But at least it scores a few 'so bad it 's good ' points . This ramshackle movie features a preposterous plot , dodgy direction and clunky editing , and yet it 's great fun to watch the actors squirm with fear . Case 39 has been forlornly gathering cobwebs in the proverbial filing cabinet for over a year . Understandably so - it 's terrible . We 'd be embarrassed too . Only the procession of unintentional laughs and an unflinchingly confident turn by youngster Jodelle Ferland as Lilith emerge as reasons not to bury your head in a bucket of popcorn and rue the regrettable moment a certain vault was unlocked . It is universally terrible in virtually every department , save for the creepy charisma displayed by young Ferland . Paramount has little faith in this supernatural fright film ... and with good reason 	Director Christian Alvert has a certain stylish flair , but it 's wasted on Case 39 's frightless , unoriginal plot .
dark days Marc Singer 's documentary Dark Days absolutely blew me away . It takes the viewer on a thoroughly engrossing journey to the heart of darkness . Mark Singer 's astonishing debut is a stylishly shot black and white 16mm documentary which focuses on the homeless who inhabit the subway tunnels beneath Manhattan . Singer 's grainy ... photography lends the film the evocative aura of something that has been unearthed , while the spare , haunting soundtrack by DJ Shadow perfectly captures the sense of otherworldliness that pervades this remarkable film . The raw honesty here is startling -- these people open themselves up to the camera in such a candid way that we ca n't help but be drawn into their world . Simultaneously uplifting and shaming . Complemented by its black-and-white photography and a moody DJ Shadow score , this is a gritty yet often tender look at society 's margins . As a chronicle of midnight and dawn in the great human day , Dark Days ranks among the most moral of films . Shot in stylized black-and-white , this docu about the homeless was the winner of multiple awards at the Sundance Film Fest . With an ending that is surprisingly upbeat , Dark Days is , in the long run , a tribute to its characters ' indomitable spirits . It 's a near-great film , reminiscent of the early Frederick Wiseman movies like Welfare and Hospital that left you both aghast and exhilarated at what human beings are capable of . 	Marc Singer 's documentary about a group of homeless people living beneath the streets of New York City is haunting and uplifting in equal measure .
swimming pool Rampling and Sagnier are superb . The former is in top form with her portrayal of Sarah 's metamorphosis , while her co-star is sensually cool as the elusive young woman . A fine sunlit noir , oozing sensuality and menace . Swimming Pool has the edgy chill of early Polanski . The twist ending is unsatisfying and the daughter 's role underdeveloped ( even if her body is n't ) . It 's Sagnier , a young Bardot , who lifts the movie , and Rampling , 58 , who gives it nuance , not to mention a nude scene that shows off a body Demi Moore would envy . Whether through manipulation or skilled filmmaking , Swimming Pool mesmerizes long after the movie is over . Ozon even steals from himself ... Eventually , [ his ] compulsion to imitate becomes an end in itself , taking his movie in directions it has n't been built to travel . Tricky thriller . The narrative logic of Swimming Pool slips through our hands like cool water , shimmery and light-dappled , leaving behind the pleasures of summer heat and goose bumps . Like a good summer book , Swimming Pool may not be weighty with profound issues . But it 's a heck of a fun read . 	A sensual thriller with two engaging performers demanding our undivided attention .
1170009-conversations with god Conversations with God . Nice work if you can get it , and you can get it if you try . What is unclear ( to me , at least ) is the process by which Walsch answered 'yes ' to God 's question and suddenly became a writer , doing what appears to be automatic writing of his first book . Simon has made a garish , lumpy , melodramatic and altogether unconvincing film about a man hitting bottom and then hearing a voice that helps him regain a place in the world ( and a pretty rich place , at that ) . There 's nothing particularly objectionable about the film ( other than its inert movie-of-the-week structure ) until Walsch takes his God-spokesman role too far in the final act . The facial hair that actor Henry Czerny is forced to wear in Conversations With God is ludicrous , even laughable -- as is much of this film . A coda after the closing credits , encouraging divine dialogues in general , does little to dispel the hagiographic aftertaste . A hackneyed , melodramatic travesty is certainly to be expected from the cinematic rendering of Neale Donald Walsch 's simplistic , best-selling self-help tomes . B movie w/ good heart . Not everyone will buy into the spirituality dogma , I 'm not sure I do . But , there is a definite need for all of us to take a deeper look into our souls . This film adaptation of Neale Donald Walsch 's best-selling book series plays more like an infomercial than a thoughtful exploration of religious issues . The movie claims the 'God inside me ' concept is rooted in compassion , but it plays like nondenominational narcissism to me . 	At some point in the conversation , God must have asked for a subtler , deeper film .
8 mile A powerful film that shows us the frustration and desperation of an entire emotionally neglected sub-class , its bravura 'rap battles ' offering up the strongest prima facie connection between hip-hop 's chest-thumping and adolescence 's shoe-gazing . In the tradition of Rocky and Fever , the movie is a shrewdly engineered piece of proletarian pop -- a story of triumph -- but , like Eminem 's enraged lyrics , 8 Mile has its own kind of vile candor . 8 Mile does everything it 's designed to do . Certainly the best first film ever by a musician crossing over to the acting world . 8 Mile is among the best studio films of the year 2002 . Una produccin es interesante en ms de un sentido . Buen debut de Eminem . It ai n't Eminem : The Movie but it does showcase Eminem : The Actor -- easily the best rapper-cum-thesp since Tupac Shakur . It 's easy to like Jimmy Smith as well as to admire him , because Mr. Mathers lets us in , with no sign of calculation , on the kindness , even tenderness , that Jimmy conceals from most of the people around him . In addition to showcasing Mathers , 8 Mile makes a case for rap as a creative rebel yell . [ Eminem ] goes the mile demanded of him and he emerges a certified winner this time out . 	Even though the story is overly familiar , there 's enough here for an engaging ride .
a dangerous method Are you ready for some `` Sexual Healing , '' David Cronenberg-style ? Cronenberg has made a wholly satisfying case study , but not quite enough of a movie . These characters ' big brains can never quite control their unruly bodies , and when the sex finally erupts , it 's like something from one of the Canadian filmmaker 's early creature features . The film radiates intelligence through clever direction and strong performances . Is n't likely to entirely appeal to Cronenberg 's core fans ( whatever that is at this point ) , but it 's a richly rewarding -- and sometimes disturbing -- film in its own right . The true story is extraordinary ; the film is not , although the actors are all fine . An oddity , but a very watchable oddity , this makes for essential viewing for Cronenberg enthusiasts and surprising viewing for those expecting a conventional period piece . Even with the spanking , this is a bit of a bore . Keira can act ! She really can . A Dangerous Method is a suave chamber piece : a series of glimpses of two 20th-century intellectual titans , in friendship and separation , and the story of a remarkable woman who history had swallowed up , brought into the light again . 	A provocative historical fiction about the early days of psychoanalysis , A Dangerous Method is buoyed by terrific performances by Michael Fassbender , Keira Knightley , and Viggo Mortensen .
don jon If `` Don Jon '' feels like a film that is spread too thin amongst multiple genres , it only goes to hint that Gordon-Levitt might be as talented behind the camera as he is in front . Gordon-Levitt 's confidence is appealing , even if the film itself mistakes redundancy for profundity . A film with tense , ironic energy in the way that scenes flow and shots collide , but in a way that feels a bit overfamiliar and safe . Gordon-Levitt has such a charismatic screen personality we can forgive him - to a degree - for most of his storytelling faults . Joseph Gordon-Levitt has not yet reached the `` star '' level where he can carry a movie . Though Don Jon succeeds in being funny at every turn , it is less successful in being a movie with something important to say . Much like its main character , this comedy is good-hearted , a bit clumsy , endearing , and incredibly rough around the edges . Crude , repetitive and rigorously single-minded , the popular actor 's writing and directing debut lays it all on a bit thick , as the few points the film has to make are underscored time and time again . Gordon-Levitt shows promise as a director and his debut has bags of cinematic swagger . This is a sweet , lively and funny movie rather than a fully realized one , but it makes clear that Gordon-Levitt has a natural feeling for cinema and should do more of it . 	Don Jon proves to be an amiable directing debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt , and a vivacious showcase for his co-star , Scarlett Johansson .
tarnation Caouette has crafted 19 years ' worth of home movies , video diaries and answering machine messages into a bracing autobiographical fever dream . Its fierce emotional honesty ca n't be denied . A daunting blend of head trip , cinma verite , music video , and auto-therapy . An original , personal , emotionally touching documentary , which represents a new type of indie , based on innovating filmmaking . Getting so close to real-life mental illness , via footage that spans many years , renders Tarnation a uniquely potent experience . By all odds , Tarnation should have been an unwatchable , masochistic morass , but Caouette 's love for the broken Renee -- which is the true subject of the film -- is awe-inspiring . A haunting , riveting film that 's as self-serving as it is revelatory . It 's movie-making as therapy , and I hope it worked . No film has ever , ever affected me as much as this one did . I do n't know whether it 's a great movie , or just particularly good at hitting all of my buttons . Tarnation is some kind of triumph of personal expression [ but ] also maddening at times in Caouette 's lack of restraint ... defiantly [ is ] what it is : one of a kind . Tarnation is a kinetic kaleidoscope , an explosion of expressionism . It 's the product of a mind blown apart , but not completely away , by tragic circumstances . 	Using music and home video footage to great effect , Jonathan Caouette has made a very personal and moving film .
mechanic Statham convincingly breaks faces with effortless ease . It 's as if he studied at The Lee Strasberg Institute of Badassery . He is the Stanislavski of neck-stomping . There 's really no clear reason why a remake was warranted or why Statham , so exquisitely calibrated to action-comedy weirdness , would sign on to rehash the ( far better ) past glories of humorless Seventies action flicks . 'The Mechanic ' is kind of a remake of a 1970s-era Charles Bronson movie . And it 's kind of a vehicle for Jason Statham , who has cemented his reputation as a tough-guy action star in the 'Transporter ' and 'Crank ' series . The Company Men with guns , but no families or pensions . All they have is their job , and retirement literally equals death . Yet one more formula flick about a taciturn killer who , despite his penchant for slaying and maiming , actually turns out to be the kind of nice guy you might consider Friending on Facebook . Exceedingly violent action remake also has sex , drinking . If you 're looking for substance , character development , and an engaging storyline , you 'll sadly be disappointed as this film is seriously lacking in all three of those areas . A summer popcorn flick for the winter : This loose remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson actioner is an unpretentious generic feature that delivers the basic goods and serves as suitable star vehicle for Jason Statham Donald Sutherland and Ben Foster : you 're so good you 're distracting me from the film . [ VIDEO ] Anything you do , do n't underestimate `` The Mechanic . '' This is one badass movie . 	Jason Statham and Ben Foster turn in enjoyable performances , but this superficial remake betrays them with mind-numbing violence and action thriller cliches .
faceoff A $ 100 million movie with a $ 3 plot . Face/Off makes bad movies look worse and makes the making of good movies look like the most thrilling work in the world . All in all , Mr . Woo has made Face/Off into an eye-popping magic show . A knockout new thriller by John Woo . The visuals are impossibly glossy and the sound impossibly loud . Every frame glistens with that antiseptic precision of advertising . Even the slightest emotional vibration is writ in 100-point type , Face/Off is a full-blooded , movie-going experience . It 's 100 percent movie . With Face/Off , John Woo , the Hong Kong auteur ( The Killer , Hard Boiled ) , has made his smartest , wildest , positively Woo-siest American thriller . The premise is , of course , absolutely ridiculous . It also is absolutely brilliant , and incredibly subversive . the film succeeds in overcoming its implausibilities because director Woo offers such a tantalising package . After seeing this numbing action flick , I 'm still stumped what all the hype is about . So many critics and viewers arond the country marveled at this movie , but for what ? It 's not a horrible movie , but it certainly is n't very good . 	John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play cat-and-mouse ( and literally play each other ) against a beautifully stylized backdrop of typically elegant , over-the-top John Woo violence .
bruno Baron Cohen is an astonishingly focussed performer ; we have no idea how he does n't crack a smile . The only thing Cohen can do is to throw the character 's sexuality in people 's faces , but there are several brilliant sequences of baiting and utilizing American gay panic that really hit the satirical button . Brno is wall-to-wall jokes , but it never loses sight of its targets , which are many and in the end all-encompassing . Starts off as a hilarious lampooning of fame and the pursuit of celebrity , but Cohen and the gang run out of material . Brno is thrillingly funny , establishing Sacha Baron Cohen as a comedian willing to go further than any other to show us what needs to be shown . When moments seem like setups with actors , they turn tame . But when things feel real -- as when Bruno conronts an Arkansas wrestling-match crowd -- they can get scary-real . Cohen holds up another mirror to American society , and if anything we 've only gotten uglier since Borat . Or maybe we 're just uglier when it comes to homosexuality . It 's an odd cop-out for so fiercely gifted a comedian ... . This is not a man who is doomed to be Allen Funt , or for that matter , Ashton Kutcher . He does n't need to rely on the easy titillations and voyeuristic pull of reality TV . A patchy , hit-and-miss comedy with a few outrageous highs and a lot of just-okay padding , Brno suggests that Sacha Baron Cohen 's in-your-face fool routine sadly is n't working any more . Most of it is inspired silliness . 	Crude and offensive , but with ample cultural insights and gut-busting laughs , Bruno is another outlandish and entertaining mockumentary from Sacha Baron Cohen .
vacancy A paint-by-numbers affair that is not only tired , but looks as if it was written by a computer program . The best that can be said is that it is what it is , and is competent at being that . Vacancy is n't a commentary , just another graphically violent horror movie , traveling a well-worn path -- urbanites wandering into the countryside and being accosted by rural weirdos . My expectations were met early on , but fell flat in the end . Vacancy may not be the most wholly original thriller but it has some heart to it and is directed with gritty , old school style by Nimrd Antal . Coupled with the good work done by the leads , Vacancy is worth checking into . Though Vacancy plays as gruesome horror in its own right , it 's also director Nimrod Antal 's criticism of how suffering has become the selling point in recent horror films . [ Director Nimrod ] Antal does such a good job that you almost overlook the absurdities built into the screenplay . Replicates the horror movie experience by placing its leads in a dark , boxlike room where they are menaced by loud surprise noises and scary images on a screen ... It 's only in the last act that things begin to get a bit flaky but up till then VACANCY does what it sets out to do without any pretenses . Vacancy enjoys a cracking pace , all thrills and no frills , leaving viewers barely enough time to catch their breath let alone to dwell on the odd hole in the plot . 	Vacancy 's restraint with gore is commendable , the thin characters and B-movie cliches less so .
10008785-appaloosa For its first hour or so , Appaloosa is a crisply paced pleasure , mostly thanks to the interplay between Harris and Mortensen . True , the film is a little long , and it loses momentum at one stage , but generally speaking this is a most enjoyable return to what was once the cinema 's most popular genre . Zellweger 's Allison zaps Virgil of his almost superhuman qualities and the film eventually becomes ordinary when the love of a woman interferes with the law . Appaloosa satisfies all its requirements but never breaks a sweat . The best western since 3:10 to Yuma , which is to say it 's a western . Sometimes Appaloosa seems bent on exploiting the standard cliches of the western genre ... while at others it seems striving to be a modernist update full of ambiguity ... This is an honest tale of the camaraderie between a pair of lawmen simply trying to do a job . ... a classical Western that invites us to savor no-nonsense camaraderie between two shootists for hire . If you 're someone who orders the usual and is just happy when it comes out warm and fresh , I reckon Appaloosa will sit with you just fine . The film is more trenchant character study than thrilling showdown , and it confounds as many generic expectations as it fulfills . 	A traditional genre western , Appaloosa sets itself apart with smart psychology , an intriguing love triangle , and good chemistry between the leads .
midnight cowboy Schlesinger 's frenzied style and visual pyrotechnics ( New Wave influence ) are less impressive than the characters and the central friendship between Joe Buck and Ratso , splendidly played by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman . We can identify with them without false sentimentality and it is impossible not to do so . I can not recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film . Classic Oscar winner has explicit material , mature themes . The attempt to wring tender laughter from such a topic strikes me as being itself a kind of commercialized vice . Midnight Cowboy 's peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking , but what is shocking , in 1994 , is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls . Um filme exemplar que deve ser visto por todos aqueles que apreciam o bom cinema . Superb performances and a compelling script have made this film a strange mix of Oscar-winner and Cult Classic . In this film the scenery is lovely and only the human race is vile . Sometimes a time capsule never dates . 	John Schlesinger 's gritty , unrelentingly bleak look at the seedy underbelly of urban American life is undeniably disturbing , but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight 's performances make it difficult to turn away .
coach carter Slam Dunk ! A sports flick that 's a worthy addition to the genre . Portrays high school basketball as a means to an end , not an end in itself . If you can claw your way through some ugly material and shoddy direction , there are some good messages here that can be warmly received . If not for the commanding presence of Samuel L. Jackson in the title role , this paint-by-numbers sports movie would n't have anything going for it . A mealy conglomeration of high-school-sports movies , teacher-who-motivates-students movies , and inner-city-kids-have-a-tough-life movies . There 's a kick butt performance from Samuel Jackson , the master of the take-no-prisoners motormouth school of acting , even if it is only a high school gym . It 's ultimately Jackson , with a winning combination of no-nonsense authority and quirky charisma , not to mention a love of flashy neckties , who breathes life into the film bearing his character 's real name . Jackson 's ... fire-and-brimstone delivery adds a much-needed edge to the inspirational cliches . Coach Carter is like the coach 's players themselves : there 's more to the film than first meets the eye ... 	Even though it 's based on a true story , Coach Carter is pretty formulaic stuff , but it 's effective and energetic , thanks to a strong central performance from Samuel L. Jackson .
overnight Even as a tragic hero , Duffy 's a bully and a bore . It 's a tale of ambition run amok and blown opportunity that is not only fascinating but cautionary . A peek into the depths of Hollywood , and human , behavior . By the end of this cautionary tale , you feel like you 've seen a guy get a shot at the big time and end up nowhere , a fate he richly deserves . The story of the neither late nor great Troy Duffy would make the perfect film-school graduation gift . In answer to Troy Duffy 's question , `` Who is this idiot Jerry Bruckheimer ? `` , he 's the guy opening National Treasure opposite your spectacularly documented flameout . As much a film about Hollywood as it is about obsessive personalities , Overnight achieves the dual feat of making us deeply dislike Duffy while we still root for him . It exerts a certain train-wreck fascination . Overnight always holds our interest , not so much as a documentary as an episode of a junky reality TV show . Highly entertaining , in a schadenfreude sense , but incomplete . 	This absorbing but wince-inducing documentary is a cautionary tale about the costs of hubris in the world of indie film .
the overnighters A boldly provocative tale of flawed humanity and hardship . Jesse Moss 's documentary is as compelling and heartrending as any drama . A social-justice documentary that packs a visceral emotional wallop to the heart and mind , The Overnighters could scarcely be more relevant to our stressy , fearful present . It develops into a study of obsession , hypocrisy , righteousness and self-doubt , questioning motive and then gob-smacking the audience with the wholly unexpected . The Overnighters is , until it falls on its face narratively , a really well-made documentary . The thrill of The Overnighters is in witnessing a heartrending payoff that could not be anticipated nor written-and , miraculously , closes the movie on a perfect irony . The movie might seem like just another liberal do-gooder profile , yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation , amplifying the Christian themes at the heart of the story . It would be a fascinating-enough doc , until a shocking third-act revelation brings it to another level . A sobering must-see , The Overnighters speaks to the eternal dilemma of doing the right thing in a community beset by suspicion and fear . Fact and fiction bleed into a sometimes aesthetically questionable , but consistently compelling interrogation of the ever-diminishing space for social ethics and Christian-based morality within state-level governmental order . 	Hard-hitting , absorbing , and painfully relevant , The Overnighters offers an urgent and compassionate picture of life in 21st century America .
barbershop [ I ] t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be . Consistently funny , and celebratory of its Chicago setting . Offers 102 minutes of breezy , occasionally very funny entertainment . This is what can happen when black actors and black filmmakers are permitted by a narrow industry to assemble a story of their own , a depiction of their own community . It 's a likable venture that just misses being a lovable one . Manages to offer a heartening lesson about communal triumph over personal gain , while shearing away all the gloss , dreck and dry ends that normally comes with so blunt a message . Once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . Chances are you wo n't , either . Despite its flaws , yhe lengthy sequences we spend in the barbershop give the film a comical & thoughtful weight that would seem most comfortable performed in a single-setting play . Pratfalls aside , Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than Barbershop . 	Besides bringing on the laughs , Barbershop displays a big heart and demonstrates the value of community .
a tale of two sisters The film feels haunted by the relationship between Im and Moon , who cling to each other in the face of a hostile hostess , even though that may not be their best option . Murky and pretty near incomprehensible . The attack of the killer wallpaper a delirious mlange of styles that absorbs us for two solid hours More deliberately paced than even the most deliberately paced Asian horror movie and twice as complex . The creepy visuals , the slow-burning tension , the meticulous pauses for effect , and the staggered trail of clues and revelations inexorably draw the viewer in . Kim 's artful Tale may be stronger on atmosphere and mood than on story , but it contains hidden charges that chip away at the borders of certainty -- and that can be scary . [ D ] issect [ s ] grief and madness with an authenticity that will engage and bewilder both your lizard brain and your higher intellect ... When all is finally revealed , it becomes clear that the stylish spookiness was its own slim reward . I like what it 's trying to do -- use a ghost story surface to tell a tale of guilt , blame , and madness -- but was disappointed in the conventional tactics it used . 	Restrained but disturbing , A Tale of Two Sisters is a creepily effective , if at times confusing , horror movie .
golden age Rich in colour , sumptuous costumes , political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more . Simply takes a chunk out of Elizabeth 's life and says , 'Here 's what happened during these years , ' without bothering to shape it into a story . The only thing connecting one Golden Age scene to the next is a choir of sopranos so insistent and shrill that you 'll wish Elizabeth would behead them instead . okay , but more silver than gold this time out . Emphasises the costumes , hair and sets over historical accuracy and depth of character . But it 's still hugely entertaining . ... the intrigue that made the original Elizabeth so gripping is simply an awkward complication here , emphasis on the awkward . The movie looks beautiful , enhanced by intriguing camerawork and sumptuous production design . But the music is overbearing , perhaps to compensate for the pedestrian script and dull history lesson . A sequel , a costume fantasy , a romantic melodrama , a CGI war spectacular , a puzzling celebration of beauty over substance . F. Scott Fitzgerald once remarked that there are no second acts in American lives . If only the same could be said about Shekhar Kapur 's 1998 Elizabeth . Highbrow camp masquerading as a history lesson soapier than any bottle of detergent . 	This sequel is full of lavish costumes and elaborate sets , but lacks the heart and creativity of the original Elizabeth
1005371-day the earth stood still It is a handsome , thoughtful fable with a thriller element and a slightly evasive ending . It is comforting , of course , to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we , but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anamolously labeled the science-fiction field . Today , wistful viewers might ask : Where are Klaatu and Gort when we need them most ? Though made half a century ago , this film remains a seminal sci-fi and a defining moment in the genre 's history as well as in the visual treatment of fear of atomic bomb . Embora soe ingnuo e mesmo datado para os dias de hoje , permanece interessante graas figura enigmtica e superior de Rennie e ameaa representada pelo impassvel Gort . Made at the time as a plead for international peace , its message should still ring true today where the world picture is more complex and , in many ways , more splintered and dangerous . This is no ordinary sci-fi flick . The film is very good at showing how effortlessly misunderstandings can develop between ordinary people and between nations and how easily fear can overwhelm reason and understanding . Gort ! Klaatu barada nikto . Cast , although secondary to the story , works well . 	Socially minded yet entertaining , The Day the Earth Stood Still imparts its moral of peace and understanding without didacticism .
clearing As fine a performance as Mirren gives -- capturing Eileen 's apprehension and sturdiness at once -- Redford is the chief reason to see The Clearing . Brugge 's acutely observant direction and Justin Haythe 's thoughtful script allow Robert Redford , Helen Mirren and Willem Dafoe to give performances that rank among their best . Competent , but not brilliant , kinapping tale has a great cast It 's a worthy effort , but by trying to do it all , both stories fail to offer a good payoff . The benefits of seeing this movie may not be worth the patience necessary to get through it . ... the dullest kidnapping-for-ransom drama ever conceived A thriller stripped of thrills -- or , even worse , a thriller that thinks of itself as somehow rising above the vulgar pleasures of excitement . Robert Redford brings to the screen a perfect couple , Wayne and Eileen Hayes . A splendid kidnapping thriller , but its craftsmanship might obscure a subtle , affecting meditation on loss and redemption . What is essentially a fairly standard kidnap drama takes on extra interest due to its superb performances and an intriguing structure . 	Though it has an excellent cast , this emotionally detached movie is the kind that one admires more than enjoys .
the witnesses 2007 The Witnesses has an emotional maturity that adds richness to its social observation . This film need not be approached with dread or trepidation ; life , as witnessed by this small group of flawed but always empathetic characters , is a messy , ugly , and unfair business , but sometimes still surprisingly wonderful . Well-served by a varied cast . Andr Tchin 's film features a strong ensemble cast . The film pulls no punches in its depiction of lives in crisis . With a critical yet compassionate perspective , the great French helmer Techine captures vividly the end of an era -- sexual freedom and beginning of AIDS -- and its zeitgeist through a touching tale of friends and lovers defying conventional mores . It is a huge credit to the actors that we end up caring about these deeply flawed individuals . Director Andre Techine 's story is one of subtle emotional tones that require the most of an actor , and the cast is uniformly compelling . Tchin 's triumph of compassion and craft shames the American cinema 's indifference to gay history . A moral tale that is n't saddled with moralism , The Witnesses is a novelistic film in the best sense . Tchin captures the changing attitudes of the times but some characters feel too peripheral . 	French director Andr Tchin successfully weaves five gripping stories in an engaging and realistic film about the early days of the AIDS epidemic .
blue streak Fun and entertaining -- a good time . Entertaining and never sluggish . Much of Lawrence 's verbal humor is more miss than hit , with the misses certain to come off as juvenile to the uninitiated . Sharp comic timing ; a solid supporting cast . In the wake of a summer of capers and cons , Blue Streak arrives as a dull afterthought and a sorry vehicle for the comic expression of Martin Lawrence . Character is precisely what 's missing in Blue Streak , with Lawrence coming off as little more than thinly defined cliches of his manic and occasionally hilarious self , and his co-stars nothing more than bland dupes and paper-thin stereotypes . Lots of fun , laughs and action ! The film may be routine , but Lawrence is anything but . Since the characters are pretty simple , and the plot wafer-thin , there 's not a lot for Martin to do but fall back on wild histrionics and facial explosions . The result is an action comedy where the comedy frequently hits the bull's-eye but is overpowered by the action . 	Martin Lawrence lends his comedic touch , but the movie is n't much more than standard action-comedy fare .
marvels the avengers Expectations delivered , promises fulfilled : The Avengers is everything you could want in a superhero movie , with larger-than-life feats believably and meaningfully executed , and beating human hearts filled with emotion , humor and pain . Mines the collective goodwill of the Marvel nation to impressive effect , There 's great entertainment in `` The Avengers '' - big bold , action-filled silliness with just enough human spirit to sell itself . This is a comic book movie done right . a winning piece of popcorn entertainment that does better with characters in an ensemble setting than many ever did when they starred in their own vehicles . Whedon , a pop-genre magician best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer , is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd . Writer-director Joss Whedon has a magpie 's eye for stealing other people 's bright ideas , and an enviable knack for improving them . Creating a script that not only lives up to the hype , but fulfills and even exceeds the expectations of fans is no easy task , but Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn have done so - and in a manner that does not give short shrift to any of the major characters . the teams most important mission is to spit funny one-liners at the face of over-the-topness This film is stylish , intelligent and , one hopes , influential on the next generation of superhero movies ; it should leave a lasting legacy . [ VIDEO ESSAY ] Sloppy in its construction , `` Marvel 's The Avengers '' has one thing going for it - humor . 	Thanks to a script that ephasizes its heroes ' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces , The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies .
1208806-its complicated Streep and Baldwin are terrific , and if you like your romance bittersweet you wo n't want to miss this one . There is a line of dialogue spoken by Meryl Streep that is worth the entire price of admission . There are four reasons to see this movie and writer-director Nancy Meyers is n't one . It 's Complicated rarely rises above the level of a television sitcom but Streep is witty and believable and has great chemistry with an ebullient , charismatic Baldwin and together they make the film a painless slice of escapism . While it may be complicated for the characters , it 's a simple formula for light movie entertainment . I found myself wishing for more shallows and fewer depths . This is escapist fluff , pure and simple , but it 's given a huge boost by some deliciously funny scripting from writer-director Nancy Meyers and a trio of ace lead performances . A smart , sophisticated and downright hilarious comedy . It 's Complicated is the kind of wholesome adult-oriented entertainment that once formed the bedrock of classical Hollywood . It 's Complicated is n't . This is straight-ahead , sophisticated comedy , an evolution of what Doris Day , Rock Hudson and Tony Randall did in the 1960s . 	Despite fine work by an appealing cast , It 's Complicated is predictable romantic comedy fare , going for broad laughs instead of subtlety and nuance .
the age of adaline The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy , but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too . Starved of sufficient comedy or drama , `` The Age of Adaline '' is a pipsqueak . Beautifully shot and absurd . Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove , like someone just asked to kiss her hand . It might be the most sepia-toned performance I 've ever seen . Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy , twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell ! Less a sincerely kooky elegy to lost time than a slightly off-kilter acting out of familiar rom-com bona fides about commitment-phobes missing out on life . Lively 's performance is appropriately mysterious but too shallow to allow audiences to empathize with her character . The fault lies more in the screenplay , which does n't give her character much depth . Far too often here , Adaline 's parade of period dresses , coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience . A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart . It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises . Instead , it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores , though not without some charm , Adaline 's romantic life . 	The Age of Adaline ruminates on mortality less compellingly than similarly themed films , but is set apart by memorable performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford .
wonderland 2000 Wonderland is so bereft of hope that it 's a chore to withstand . It is easy to admire . Wonderland feels contrived . A film of scruffy beauty and spellbinding power , which seems constructed to capture the appeal of eavesdropping . Michael Winterbottom doggedly excavates the innate sadness of his characters -- to the point of numbing his audience . The film 's realistic approach to storytelling and the strong performances mesh well with Winterbottom 's stylistic flourishes . This small-scale saga is blessed with talented players . Wonderland is like some kind of collective punishment for being English . [ Winterbottom ] ca n't pull this humdrum tragicomedy out of the gutter . A depressing and ultimately boring story filled with miserable , depressed and lonely characters . 	A film that tackles something as simple as everyday life and succeeds beatifully . The witty script and clever direction keep the film flowing , while the superb acting keeps it alive . It does n't aim for the sky and for that reason it hits its mark .
grease 2 As a sequel to `` Grease '' it 's terrible , and as a musical on its own merits , it 's absolutely abysmal . Grease 2 is a bad movie that really does n't deserve much of a defense . There are moments in it that are so cringeworthy , one might think they were the reason fast-forward buttons were included on VCRs . Grease is most emphatically not the word this summer . In its sheer awfulness , it is one of the best camp entertainments you could ever find . Where this film has a decided edge on its predecessor is in the staging and cutting of the musical sequences . Yup , it really is THAT bad . Hilariously bad , even . Definitely of the so-bad-it's-almost-good genre , this kinda stands the test of time in a camp way , mainly because of the charm of Pfeiffer and Carrington . It does n't work , but you could spend the time spotting relatives of the stars . A gloriously unpretentious gem just waiting to be discovered . That the film has n't yet received the full respect it deserves only adds to its charm . Sheer energy , a handful of good tunes ( including a great theme song from the Four Tops ) , and some very funny one-liners save the day . 	Grease 2 is undeniably stocked with solid songs and well-choreographed dance sequences , but there 's no getting around the fact that it 's a blatant retread of its far more entertaining predecessor .
jaws Jaws knew how to keep audiences invested . While getting to know the human characters and seeing what makes them relatable , the audience salivates for another monster scene . Jaws ' formula has become a facsimiled equation for profit , of which the opening is the preeminent , telling feature . Before we see anything , our ears are chilled by composer John Williams ' menacing two note soundtrack which then builds into that unforgettable frenzy as the unseen shark savages its first victim . Nowadays , it does n't really scare me anymore , but I love watching it for the way it moves . You think of the excess that followed in Jaws ' wake and realise how well judged that first blockbuster is . Jaws remains , decades later , a near perfect film . ... a classic , action-adventure monster movie , maybe the best ever made . ( Blu-ray edition ) Basically , Jaws is an excellent routine movie , the sort normally made on a moderate budget and aimed at the neighborhood houses . In the end , the shark is a MacGuffin necessary for the men to bond and test themselves against what they fear most -- their own mortality . To be brief and to the point , the GREATEST FILM EVER MADE ! Thank you for your time . 	Compelling , well-crafted storytelling and a judicious sense of terror ensure Steven Spielberg 's Jaws has remained a benchmark in the art of delivering modern blockbuster thrills .
philomena A terrifically moving film that has a fitting earthbound feel to it as well as a barely suppressed anger at crimes inflicted on the powerless One of the most eloquent , powerful and perfect movies I have ever seen . Director Steven Frears deserves special mention . A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy , sentimental junk . The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real . It 's the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today . The true story of 'Philomena ' hits so close to my own past that I could n't leave the theater without tears . Dench and Coogan are the beating heart of Philomena , which despite a few storytelling flaws , ultimately presents a stirring and enjoyable moviegoing experience . `` Philomena '' is a moving story that serves as a perfect vehicle for the incomparable Judi Dench . At its core , this clever , wrenching , profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty . Not only is the film an interesting real-life drama , it also works as a buddy comedy thanks to the versatile performances of both Steve Coogan and Judi Dench . Frears manages to get the tone just right . Even the most jaded of audiences will find it hard not to be moved by Philomena 's quest for her missing son . Why does it work quite so well ? In part , it 's the Dench effect . 	Based on a powerful true story and led by note-perfect performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan , Philomena offers a profoundly affecting drama for adult filmgoers of all ages .
furious 7 The ramrod-serious Diesel and Statham sell the dialogue , anyway . So do the more lighthearted Johnson and Tyrese Gibson . Johnson and Gibson wring laughs from obvious jokes . The acting champ of 7 , though , is Michelle Rodriguez . A slim excuse , and a perfectly good one , for trotting around the globe , blowing up drones in Los Angeles and sending Lebanese sports cars crashing through Abu Dhabi skyscrapers . Operating with the same adolescent , bacchanalian glee of a comic book ... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity , emotion , and head-shaking absurdity . Furious 7 is the perfect popcorn movie and there is no better way they could have paid tribute to Paul Walker . ... lazy and annoying , devoid of any hint of what might have once made it interesting . But that is not to say that there are n't exciting moments , it 's just that none of them add up to anything we care about . Loud , long and laughably over-the-top , Furious 7 is one of the best pure action movies ever made . 'Furious 6 ' was `` dumb fun '' to a breaking point . 'Furious 7 ' revives the franchise with cohesion and elegance . For now , let 's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style `` B '' programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences . Put simply and bluntly , Fast & Furious 7 is great , thrilling , balls-to-the-wall entertainment . It 's not only , and easily , the best in the F & F series , it 's one of the best car operas you 're ever likely to see . Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker , James Wan , was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director 's chair , he proves to be a perfect fit . 	Serving up a fresh round of over-the-top thrills while adding unexpected dramatic heft , Furious 7 keeps the franchise moving in more ways than one .
divided we fall A decent and honorably made film . Manages to be funny and touching without ever resorting to schmaltz . The performances ... pull us into the humanity and indignity of it all . Shows that it 's not only possible to make a spine-tingling World War II saga without bloodshed , but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing-but-necessary values of conscience , loyalty and forgiveness . As with the films of Emir Kusturica , whose characters also resist easy analysis , the people in Divided We Fall are completely and wonderfully human . Confronts an incendiary topic head-on with grace , style , compassion and exquisitely practical wit . The settings are authentic , but the acting comes across fairly flat . A provocative Holocaust drama saturated with tension and streaked with dark comedy . Parts are very funny , but not over the top like Life is Beautiful . Even in the most appalling circumstances , it suggests , human folly can be funny and even moving . 	Divided We Fall takes a complex look at World War II , skillfully balancing humor and gravity .
history of violence David Cronenberg 's searing drama ... confronts us to ask about the effects of violence on its characters ' minds and souls . Touches on dusky psychological nerves while maintaining an uncharacteristically easy accessibility . Right from its first , quietly unnerving scene A History of Violence is unmistakably the work of an artist with a purpose . There 's nothing more off-putting than being treated like a guinea pig . A History of Violence is shrewd , penetrating and , yes , entertaining . It 's also one of the best films of the year . ... a distillation of all the weird and troubling truths he has ever wanted to tell us . A film that manages to be gorgeous , scary , sexy and vicious , all at once . A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills , David Cronenberg 's latest mindblower is the feel-good , feel-bad movie of the year . A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating , not to be missed film . Cronenberg nous offre une fois de plus une mise en scne qui s'est considrablement assagie [ ... ] on ne peut toutefois rfuter qu'il a encore normment de suite dans les ides 	A History of Violence raises compelling and thoughtful questions about the nature of violence , while representing a return to form for director David Cronenberg in one of his more uncharacteristic pieces .
superman iv the quest for peace Quickly followed by Superman V : The Need to Explain What The Hell We Were Thinking . The Superman series gets more and more whimsically outrageous as it goes along . It 's a shame that `` Superman '' had to leave the eighties in such a disgraceful fashion . Of course , Superman saves the world , but the real news is that there 's still some life in the series . ... this final sigh of a movie manages to send the series out with a feeble yet breathing dignity . It 's bad , but it 's better than III in that it does try to rise above itself . Bargain basement caper . It 's hard to escape the conclusion that all the originality and excitement have been drained from the series . It`s hard to summon much wonder when Superman goes mano-a-mano with Nuclear Man , a Lex Luthor creation with a static electricity problem . The cut-rate production resulted in what Reeve termed `` catastrophe '' for a film intended to marry a serious message to the series ' signature action , humor , and romance . For sentimentality 's sake , it 's great watching Reeve and company reprise their roles even if it 's in the bastard child edition of the series , but this is n't just one of the worst comic book films , it 's one of the worst films ever made . 	The Superman series bottoms out here : the action is boring , the special effects look cheaper , and none of the actors appear interested in where the plot 's going .
the duke of burgundy The Duke of Burgundy is a deeply eccentric filigree of a film , as aesthetically refined a piece of cinematic artifice as I 've seen in ages . The film twists and sways like a rattlesnake , drawing you in before drawing blood . There is confrontational content here , and gasp-out-loud moments , but the surprises are in the ideas and themes Strickland lays bare , rather than envelope-pushing visuals . A deliciously deviant romp into sexual adventure grounded in the real life struggle for enduring intimacy . Strickland 's skill is in how quickly he normalizes the proceedings , neither condescending to his characters nor using their inclinations for cheap laughs . The real problem with the film is a gradual mood switch that , for me , did n't work at all . Sexy , funny , beguiling , and above all , humane , The Duke of Burgundy does for erotic euro-lesbian thrillers what Under the Skin did for sci-fi . This is another psychological portrait , but of a shared psychology , one facing great strife . Bondage coming undone . ... trust in this auteur as `` The Duke of Burgundy '' blossoms into a louche hothouse Gothic that plays like Dario Argento 's `` Celine and Julie Go Boating '' or Peter Greenaway 's `` Angels and Insects . '' You get the sense that if Strickland had set his movie on some suburban couch in Brooklyn , it would work just as well . 	Stylish , sensual , and smart , The Duke of Burgundy proves that erotic cinema can have genuine substance .
love guru A bomb like this is a career killer , and Myers ' is set to blow . If you 're in the mood for a delightful tweak of today 's self-actualizing New Age gurus , look elsewhere . If , on the other hand , you want to see gags about boogers , elephant poop , and mano-a-mano duels with mops drenched in urine , then this is for you . The Love Guru is creatively awful . The feeling you derive from this dud is comparable to swallowing a bottle of bulky Viagra pills while nursing an inflamed strep throat . ... might just be the most puerile mainstream movie ever made ... The worse the joke is , the greater the manic gleam in Myers ' eyes . He 's trying to sell setups he probably knows are n't funny , and the strain can be hard to watch . The endless winks at the camera look more desperate , the jokes at Troyer 's expense seem more tasteless . They say sarcasm is the lowest form of wit . Well 'they ' obviously have n't seen 'The Love Guru ' , an overgrown dirt-patch of clunking juvenilia . When Pitka ends his bite-size lessons with 'TM , ' we should understand it 's not meditation but branding he 's after . [ I ] s n't merely endlessly crude : it 's also dishonest and contemptuous of itself ... It seems the person in greatest need of a bit of self-help is Myers himself . 	The Love Guru features far too many gross-out gags , and too few earned laughs , ranking as one of Mike Myers ' poorest outings .
parenthood A funny , uneven look at the ups , downs , joys and sorrows of being a parent . It 's a bit heavy-handed , but stll touching . It 's the best kind of comedy , where we recognize the truth of what 's happening even while we 're smiling , and where we eventually acknowledge that there is a truth in comedy that serious drama never can quite reach . Most films are advised not to include too many featured parts lest none be adequately developed , but director Ron Howard is one of the few who can and does bring this off . Parenthood gets a lot of emotional mileage out of kiddie antics , but Howard has , thankfully , given us a little more . Steve Martin 's manically over-conscientious dad steals the film , whether chewing the pitch as his small son fumbles at baseball , or entertaining a kids ' party as an unconvincing cowboy . Howard juggles all the characters effortlessly , showcasing troubles left and right without losing the film to gloom . It 's nimble work , blessed with a cast that knows exactly what they 're reaching for in their performances . It 's a shock , and a welcome one , to see Steve Martin cast against type as a doting dad . Martin 's nippy wit continually lifts this movie above the swamp of sentiment . A mosaic that views parenthood from many different angles and approaches and at times even comes near to restoring something that has been missing from film : some powerful drama . Punchy entertainment for the open-minded family , the kind that realizes Home Sweet Home is -- well , an interesting idea . Parenthood is a middlebrow masterpiece . Not a masterpiece of middlebrow but a middlebrow masterpiece , with the latter word being the subject , not the modifier . 	Bolstered by a delightful cast , Parenthood is a funny and thoughtfully crafted look at the best and worst moments of family life that resonates broadly .
blood work This is the Eastwood of old , and the fact that he can still pull off such heroics tells us how far he had to stretch to play nervous and frail . [ A ] strong piece of work . One of the most appealing aspects of Blood Work is that , both as director and star , [ Eastwood ] uses his age to impressive , even poignant , effect in a straightforward thriller with more-than-average depth . A worthwhile thriller . The film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . Eastwood does n't do much to spice up Blood Work , but you ca n't fault his sturdy filmmaking style any more than you could a plumber who stops your pipes from leaking . Sure , Eastwood 's made bad movies before , but as with his fellow great director-star Woody Allen , there 's a feeling that this time the creative decline is irreversible . Eastwood should spend the next five years gargling to get rid of the taste . It 's always nice to see Clint . Disappointing , predictable , and graphic . 	Blood Work is a routine , but competently made thriller marred by lethargic pacing .
syriana this movie could be the one where Clooney finally gets his due . A whirlwind of ambition and outrage . Mr. Gaghan does n't insult our intelligence , but he demands our attention . If you 're up to those demands , you 'll be rewarded . One of the best films of the year reveals the violence , the corruption , and the political chicanery involved in maintaining our addiction to fossil fuels . It has big ideas , but no pulse . There is a weird absence of both dramatic heat and political light here . Syriana impresses , not because it is very moving , which it is n't , or because it is crystal clear , which it also is n't , but because it is so large , so encompassing , so seemingly privy to inside stuff . What 's so powerful about the film is the rich stories it tells and how it leads them like so many human tributaries to one black , bubbling source . Gaghan piles one storyline on another but is only interested in suggesting where they trend , working like a ( cynical ) editorialist who has made up a few examples to support his views . Syriana is complex , engrossing , involving and depressing . Difficult to absorb , it is also difficult to accept , and it is one of the best films of 2005 . 	Ambitious , complicated , intellectual , and demanding of its audience , Syriana is both a gripping geopolitical thriller and wake-up call to the complacent .
joe strummer the future is unwritten Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten is that rarest of movie biographies : a warts-and-all exploration of the life and times of its subject . This offers Strummer fans unlimited access to the man behind the legend . Though it really is for fans - who should run and buy it . The end result is a documentary that feels very insider and exclusive ... it 's probably best suited to those who are already fans . Leaves behind a surprising afterglow and allows you to appreciate Joe Strummer 's warmth . a loving filmic portrait The Future Is Unwritten does an ample job of capturing the many facets of Strummer , who was simultaneously self-effacing and and heroic , devoted and calculating , sensitive and brazen . The late punk rock legend Joe Strummer is rendered fully human in Julian Temple 's engrossing and all-encompassing portrait . Celebrates Strummer 's fecundity and self-invention and honors his reticence and private despair , reminding us along the way what a contradictory and amazing affair a single human life is . One of the most compelling documentary portraits of a musician yet made . The story illustrates how easily political art can be hijacked by the other side , and it illuminates the anguish of a man who spent the last 20 years of his life wrestling with his legacy . 	Displaying Joe Strummer warts and all , The Future is Unwritten succeeds as both an engrossing documentary and a comprehensive examination of one of music 's most legendary figures .
late marriage Harrowing , riveting film . Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . An unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . The screenplay is too obvious in its critique of arranged marriages , and its portrayal of Zaza 's malicious parents is smugly cynical . Ashkenazi and Elkabetz are sensational in the lead roles . Features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . The last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch . This may be Dover Kosashvili 's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . One of those welcome visitors , a movie that turns out to be much more than we expected . 	An observant black comedy about arranged marriages and tradition .
madagascar Es un ejemplo claro de que la animacin todava tiene mucho que ofrecer , aunque sea de manera sencilla . ... surprisingly plain and punchless . Still , Madagascar playfully aims to please its intended viewers ( read : tykes ) with its wandering spirit . The zaniest zebra and looniest lemurs this side of Shrek 's forest . Outranks any other animated film in recent memory if only for its dedicated avoidance of any and all lessons imparted or learned . ... works for what it 's shooting for : a generally kid-friendly film that keeps everyone occupied for just under an hour and a half . A film that is very nearly not very good at all . What a joy . Just a fun good-hearted film . I giggled nearly the whole time . Amiably entertaining . A shallow attempt at filmmaking and humor . A foursome of digitally animated zoo animals escape the inner city confines of Manhattan 's Central Park Zoo in search of freedom that 's not be all it 's cracked up to be in this well-defined children 's comedy . 	Though its story is problematic in spots and its humor is hit-or-miss for the adult crowd , Madagascar boasts impressive visuals and enough spunky charm to keep children entertained .
ref The Ref benefits from having actor 's actors like Davis and Spacey in the leads . One of the most underrated comedies of the 1990s Dennis Leary 's shining hour . His stand-up persona 's greatest moment and it was all down hill from there . It 's a shame the comedy has a running joke that stinks , a ridiculous ending and language unsuitable for family viewing . In his first starring role , comedian Leary makes his ranting career criminal strangely sympathetic . This is a funny idea , but the movie is too thinly written to build any real credibility , and the cast rarely seems in tune with the vapid vulgarities that dominate the dialogue . This is one holiday party you 'll want to miss . A wicked update of `` The Ransom of Red Chief , '' re-imagined for the dysfunctional '90s . Very funny , ultimately appealing . ... [ The Ref is ] the sort of movie that improves on repeated viewings . 	Undeniably uneven and too dark for some , The Ref nonetheless boasts strong turns from Denis Leary , Judy Davis , and Kevin Spacey , as well as a sharply funny script .
feel the noise A cool blend of Puerto Rican and Nuyorican rhythmic , racial and family ties that bind , Feel The Noise likewise taps into a hot fusion of African derived sounds and sensibilities that connect those multiple cross-continental roots together . This music-driven melodrama aims to salute and promote a cultural phenomenon -- reggaeton music , in this case -- by slathering it all over an instantly forgettable , clich-laden pop flick . I did n't feel this noise . It 's the subtexts -- about minority kinship and Hispanic self-actualization -- that resound . If only its fable ( and leading man ) did n't keep getting in the way . Dramatic tension and narrative momentum are MIA . Could have used more music . Producer Jennifer Lopez 's cameo in the film 's climactic Puerto Rican Day parade sequence feels like a victory lap for successfully bilking film financiers and moviegoers out of their money . A horrid excuse for teen escapism ... for those who find Hannah Montana too challenging . The plot is contrived , the performances are all over the board , and Chomski 's camera ogles his actresses just a little too much . Reggaeton has officially come of age : The burgeoning subgenre now has a terrible , opportunistic exploitation movie to call its own . 	Despite the different musical genre , Feel the Noise is as generic as any music-themed film that has come before it .
1014793-near dark Southern-fried vampire-noir romance action horror tragedy . I love this movie . An unusually intelligent little gem that stands head and fangs above other blooksucking flicks . It 's a smart , creepy , violent , funny , and modern vampire movie that benefits from some wonderful performances , a stunning visual texture , and music by Tangerine Dream . An auspicious solo directing debut from Kathryn Bigelow . Dark , bloody and very stylish , this genre-busting western-noir-vampire hybrid is a toothsome joy and definitely one of the best horror films of the 1980s . Near Dark remains Kathryn Bigelow 's best film , suffused with style and anarchy that has an unerring feel for the irregular pulse of a very particular place and time . Cool little vampire flick When the viewer wants to know more about the people in the compelling images , the screen`s texture suddenly falls flat . The scenes of the bullying are long and violent and bloody and boring . Como terror focado em vampiros , empalidece diante de Garotos Perdidos , lanado no mesmo ano ; como alegoria do submundo das drogas e de uma poca em que o sexo se tornou letal , bvio e infantil . Como esta bobagem virou cult , no sei explicar . 	Near Dark is at once a creepy vampire film , a thrilling western , and a poignant family tale , with humor and scares in abundance .
when marnie was there The journey in Marnie is so pretty that it 's unlikely many will pay great mind to [ the film 's ] flaws . Ultimately , When Marnie Was There is a sweet film , worthy of the studio that produced it . The Ghibli studio is in transition , but `` Marnie , '' despite some gentle moments of reflection , is a ghost shadow of its previous masterworks . Low-key , delicate and quite special . Showcasing the gorgeous hand-drawn work that is a hallmark of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli , When Marnie Was There tells a story of youthful friendship tinged with melancholy and magic . The artwork is simple and elegant ; Anna 's fragility and self-loathing is portrayed clearly . There are times , especially in the first act , when `` When Marnie Was There '' lacks a certain urgency , often moving with all the drive of a breeze through the oft-heard wind chimes . And then the final act really grabs the heartstrings ... If indeed Hiromasa Yonebayashi 's When Marnie Was There turns out to be the final film to come from Studio Ghibli , it would be hard to imagine a more elegant or appropriate farewell . It 's a kid 's movie that grown-ups will like . As Marnie does on Anna , the movie casts a spell . This is , disappointingly , a long way from being a Studio Ghibli classic . 	When Marnie Was There is still blessed with enough visual and narrative beauty to recommend , even if it is n't quite as magical as Studio Ghibli 's greatest works .
letters to juliet There are a few moments where the romance is overdone , and the film verges on being too sentimental , but those scenes are saved by the sweet performances of its cast . [ Redgrave 's ] performance makes the predictable antics of Letters to Juliet worth tolerating . `` Letters to Juliet '' takes an improbable script and turns it into a moving love story , featuring wonderful performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Amanda Seyfried . Somewhere , not so long ago , a documentary was made about the true-life background of this fictional romance . The picture never looks fussed-over or flattened -- it breathes , as opposed to just looking merely pretty . Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan 's script relentlessly piles on goopy conversation-stoppers like `` Do you believe in destiny ? '' and `` I did n't know that true love had an expiration date . '' Save yourself 10 bucks , and an hour and 45 minutes of your precious time . There 's nothing wrong with a squishy , sentimental romantic confection now and then . But Letters to Juliet is a mere lollipop . It 's gone before its 101-minute running time expires , and you 're left with the stick . Letters From Juliet is far from a great movie . But if you 're female or -- like me -- a man with a taste for romance and a fairer deal for our senior citizens , this is one of the year 's guiltiest pleasures . ... an acceptable time-killer ... 	Letters to Juliet has a refreshingly earnest romantic charm , but it suffers from limp dialogue and an utter lack of surprises .
1003361-cabinet of dr caligari A landmark of Expressionist cinema and contains many dazzling set pieces . The story is a revolution of wickedness : a wheel of bizarre occurrences and unsettling characters that engulf the peaceful serenity of a small , oddly designed town . A case can be made that Caligari was the first true horror film . Thrilling , chilling , electrifying . Other areas of innovation and influence are often overstated , but its silent scream still registers . still creepy good entertainment on a rainy day Caligari , however edited , is still a powerhouse of a horror film , a significant breakthrough in style and in expression : a poetical vision . One of the great-grandfathers of Horror Cinema ... and it 's still pretty darn creepy today . well crafted mystery thriller that is far more satisfying than most modern Hollywood formula fare One of those rare , amazing technical accomplishments that also succeeds as art . 	Arguably the first true horror film , The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari set a brilliantly high bar for the genre -- and remains terrifying nearly a century after it first stalked the screen .
jiminy glick in lalawood There are only so many show-biz junkies in the known universe , and maybe they 'll be the only ones who will find Jiminy Glick in La La Wood a font of endless giggles . Glick is a one-note joke , and a flat note at that . I did find myself laughing at times , and if you are a Jiminy Glick fan , you will too . There 's a method to the madness after all . The improvised dialogue has a no-holds-barred quality that can hit or miss . But when it hits , it can be hysterical . The sight of Short impersonating David Lynch , in portentous Rod Serling mode , is priceless . The poking fun at movie stars stuff is mostly funny , but the filler scenes fall flat . Jiminy Glick In La La Wood is a movie with an identity problem . Martin Short himself is one of the funniest men alive , or can be , and has been . But Jiminy Glick needs definition if he 's to work as a character . Short 's fans should wait for the DVD , where they can skip to the good scenes , which amount to 24 minutes of ace material -- perhaps not coincidentally , the same length as an old SCTV episode . 	A television sketch streatched to feature length .
street kings Pic itself is similarly conflicted , glamorizing gunslinging while crying foul over unnecessary force . Movies like `` Street Kings '' are sitting ducks in a shooting range for film critics who laugh all through the movie only to condemn it for being so damn entertaining . Street Kings proves to be as standard-issue as much of the gear assigned to real police officers ... and this familiarity often numbs the picture 's effectiveness . What could have been endearingly daft remains merely forgettable . The cast is filled with some very talented actors , but none of them really shines out in a film that ultimately feels like a thousand other police thrillers . There 's something cynical about Ayers ' attempt to preserve Ludlow as a hero after scene upon scene meant to show , with heavy irony , how lawlessly he enforced the law . A B-level cop thriller with an A-list cast , Street Kings engages when taken on its own , trashy terms . But even at that , the film provokes unintentional laughter . Disposable crime flick . It will feel mighty familiar to anybody who saw Ayer and Ellroy 's previous collaboration , Dark Blue , as this is -- almost beat for beat -- the exact same story . Just a lot of huffing and puffing ... and nothing blows you away . 	Street Kings contains formulaic violence but no shred of intelligence .
little children Best drama of the year Little Children 's stone-cold suburbia reaches for Kubrick , but is also half Spielberg . The sexual awakening of a disappointed wife may seem like an old movie turn , but when has it been done with such candor ? Built from a perfect story-telling collaboration . In requiring only passivity from its audience , whom it shovel-feeds faux-erudite lessons , it 's the Academy Award-baiting version of Do n't Ask , Just Tell cinema . Auteur Todd Field and co-writer Tom Perrotta have created a group of some of the most unsympathetic characters to ever blight movie screen . Little Children refers not only to the kids that the parents worry about but also to the adults who often behave immaturely . Compelling in the way it explores the notion that adults always cruelly use children for their own ends . Unexpected compassion is one of the few hopeful things in Little Children , which will not be easy for moviegoers to shake . I saw it three months ago and I 'm still chewing over its central irony . Although some of the actors are terrific , especially Winslet , Haley , Adams , and Phyllis Somerville as Ronald 's loving mother , their work is undercut by the film 's attitude of smirky superiority toward its characters . The superiority is unearned . 	Little Children takes a penetrating look at suburbia and its flawed individuals with an unflinching yet humane eye .
this is spinal tap The story of an embarrasingly inept heavy-metal band called Spinal Tap , Rob Reiner 's film set the mockumentary standard that has come to define much of modern screen comedy . [ Blu-ray ] Reiner 's brilliantly inventive script and smart visuals avoid all the obvious pitfalls , making this one of the funniest ever films about the music business . ... it probably helps not to like the music in order to appreciate the satire more . one of the funniest movies ever made A towering achievement in cinema , music , and life art . Funnier and more prescient every time I see it . Any time they tour I will be there . Returning to Spinal Tap always brings with it a pronounced sense of discovery , a freshness that is uncommon with movies generally and unspeakably rare in a comedy . ... a superbly executed , whimsical fit of improvisation and cinema verite pastiche that so convincingly created an awful '70s-'80s heavy metal band that the band itself lived on beyond the movie . Yes Nigel , you did go to 11 . Where would cinematic comedy be if you had n't ? A hilariously scathing indictment of the rock and roll lifestyle , and all the egoism and shallow philosophising that goes along with it . The satire is ever so refreshingly played straight , is seemingly benign and dead-on funny . 	Smartly directed , brilliantly acted , and packed with endlessly quotable moments , This Is Spinal Tap is an all-time comedy classic .
inception Inception is a grown-up thriller ride through the dreamscapes of the mind , with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead . The movie is a sign that Hollywood retains some intellectual oomph . Conceptually alluring but laborious and visionless ( S ) tories should show , not tell , and Nolan keeps telling us that he ca n't tell this story . It 's just grade-A filmmaking . If movies are shared dreams , then Christopher Nolan is surely one of Hollywood 's most inventive dreamers , given the evidence of his commandingly clever Inception . This is a movie people will go see and then argue about and then , very likely , go see again . It is instantly the must-see film of the summer . Inception could very well be Nolan 's masterpiece . Directors have been trying to replicate the world of dreams since the beginning of cinema ... With his ingeniously inventive psychological thriller Inception , Christopher Nolan stakes his claim on this ambitious cinematic territory . Inception a dynamic , moving mind-bender . The good news is , I 'm not going to give away any of the mind-bending twists at the center of Inception . The bad news is , that 's because there are n't any . 	Smart , innovative , and thrilling , Inception is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually .
1080990-fallen A masterful supernatural thriller , using simple techniques to remarkable effect . Fallen aims to be a classy thriller , but it never gets under your skin the way it should . An unholy union between Seven and The Exorcist . An effective genre film that leaves an unmistakably good impression , which is something most of Hollywood 's supernatural thrillers usually fail to do . An interesting , occasionally suspenseful supernatural thriller . A tense and compelling supernatural thriller . Not everything in this film works as well as it might , but Fallen does build to a nice keep-em-guessing finale . Director Gregory Hoblit consistently opts for an atmosphere of gloomy malaise rather than going for the cheap shocks . With a smartly written script by Academy Award nominee Nicholas Kazan and deft direction by Gregory Hoblit , Fallen tells a detective story with a different solution but classic police tracking . ... an erratic yet rewarding thriller ... 	Has an interesting premise . Unfortunately , it 's just a recycling of old materials , and not all that thrilling .
hot rod You may enjoy the way Schaffer and Samberg prolong Rod 's pratfalls to absurd length , but the pleasure fades because there 's no skill to the slapstick , only glorified amateurism . Consistently laugh-aloud funny , a guilty chucklefest of ridiculous stunts , gleeful pummelings and questionable jokes that looks as if it were made by high school buddies who had a few weeks to kill . Those hoping for feature-length doses of Samberg 's Lazy Sunday wit will have to settle for just plain lazy , as Hot Rod aims low and still manages to miss its target . Uneven but often funny . ... comedy is a subjective thing , and what makes one person laugh may simply bore someone else . Hod Rod bored me . Samberg proves to be less than big screen-ready ( hardly surprising , given his most notable SNL work has come in music video shorts and not any sketch work ) . At least Hot Rod proves one thing : Even with the lowest expectations , it 's possible to be disappointed . There really is a fine line between clever and stupid , and the Hot Rod guys are on the wrong side of it . Things that crack up these guys leave other people straight-faced . Some of the mugging and quirky line readings probably should have been excised . The results are barely worth an illegal download . 	A few funny scenes ca n't save the disjointed Hot Rod , which is too silly and sloppy to hold up .
listen to me marlon We do come away with some sympathy for his bitterness at feeling that the world has used him badly , even if the opposite would seem to be closer to the truth . Like Kapadia 's `` Amy , '' `` Listen To Me Marlon '' restores the subject 's actual persona from the dinged and dented media creation in his own words . A first-rate , first-person dissection of his life by the talented , charming and oft-troubled actor , Brando . The definitive portrait of a man still frequently cited as the world 's greatest actor . The film is unique in that it is all Brando all the time , so we get to spend a couple of hours ( and a lifetime ) with the man . Thanks to the candid quality of those recordings and some excellent production from Riley , Listen to Me Marlon is a powerful and insightful experience . It 's doubtful that Brando ever thought the revelatory tapings would one day provide fodder for a documentary , but thanks to his recordings Riley has managed to construct a tribute to the actor that his fans have long deserved . Much of the visual footage here -- the film-highlights reel , the Sacheen Littlefeather incident at the 1973 Academy Awards -- is already so familiar that it dulls the pleasure of hearing Brando 's unfettered thoughts . It 's a thoroughly subjective and effective attempt to capture how it must have felt to be Marlon Brando . Using a ghostly digital rendition of the actor 's face on a computer screen to embody his words , the filmmakers make Brando eerily come alive at times to tell his story . Wow . It 's nothing short of transcendent . 	Listen to Me Marlon offers a fascinating look at the inner life of a Hollywood icon , told in his own words .
girl with the red riding hood Seeing the plot of 'Twilight ' get stuffed into Little Red 's riding hood is a painful business . But look for a fat box office . The girl who does n't know how to handle two suitors and dithers between them as a means to prolong the agonies of young love has seen its day . It was brought to the point of exhaustion in the movie Hardwicke modeled so much of this on . But , my , what sharp teeth Ms. Hardwicke does n't have . They live outside a forest ruled by a werewolf . JUST MOVE ! It 's only thatched huts we 're talking about . It 's not like they 're locked in with property values like we are today . They can build more thatched huts be another forest . Adamantly refuses to provide any wit , humor or fun , concerning itself mostly with the heroine 's taxing dilemma of picking between the rural village 's two best looking boys . Just when you think you 've finished with one of these annoying franchises , another one pops up to plague you . Social and sexual tension is nil , thus making a perfect fit with the clawless drama . [ Hardwicke ] has a gift for taking situations of bloodcurdling thrills and investing them with all of the drama of a sophomore fussing over her prom date . A passable young-adult thriller . Gary Oldman is the one bright light in this tired drama that deserves neither his talent or your time . 	Amanda Seyfried is magnetic in Red Riding Hood 's starring role , but she 's let down by her uninspired leading men and a painfully cliched script .
but im a cheerleader ... the film plays gay stereotypes as broad farce and middle class fear as frantic panic , but there 's no bite beyond the cartoonish laughs . Ungainly sentiment and unnecessary stylization . But I 'm a Cheerleader plays a lot like a sitcom , only not a very funny one . Something needs straightening out here . Broadly conceived and schematically directed ( or is it non-directed ? ) , this is a shallow satire , basically a short extended into feature length movie , about a rehabilitation camp for gays and lesbians that wastes the talent of Natasha Lyons . Crushingly obvious and abysmally unfunny . The edgy dialogue keeps the film fresh , lively and light . Dumb , heavy-handed satire . A candy-coated , completely negligible bit of fluff that plays like emasculated John Waters . Very quickly grows repetitive and groan-inducing . 	Critics think that But I 'm a Cheerleader could have been better . The acting is stiff at times and the plot is surprisingly unoriginal .
the science of sleep The filmmaker , working from his own script for the first time , is so joyful , so ebullient , that he manages to skirt pretentiousness even when the movie becomes oppressively whimsical . A creative , original work by a filmmaker with a fantastic visual flair who refuses to stick to any typical cinematic patterns , even if it 's sometimes to a fault . As was famously said , we 'll always have Paris . Very few , even the makers of Amelie , have Paris quite like Gondry . never achieves the emotional depth of Eternal Sunshine , but it 's a merry lark full of off the wall humor and offbeat imagery the film 's wild images and sense of fun are fleeting at best , and start to leak away the second the credits begin to roll The backloading of the film 's intelligence is n't sufficient reward for having made it through 100 minutes of capricious indulgence . It suffers occasionally from self-consciousness and over-indulgence in its own oddity , but Gondry 's grasp of emotion and visuals is enchanting . Even if he seems several sandwiches short of a picnic . An endearing , beautiful , hopelessly honest mess that 's supported by a pair of performances so unnaturally natural that they draw you in and clutch you , struggling , to their flipping , flopping hearts . A nightmare As for Bernal and Gainsbourg , they sell their unconventional romance convincingly . And in support , French character actor Alain Chabat steals a couple of scenes as Stephane 's piggish co-worker . 	Lovely and diffuse , Sleep is n't as immediately absorbing as Gondry 's previous work , but its messy beauty is its own reward .
dumbo ... thoroughly modest and , at times , nearly slapdash in execution , [ Dumbo ] retains its power to charm . With its colorful circus setting and quirky characters , this short Disney movie is easy to like , but it 's Dumbo himself who steals your heart . There 's a pleasant little story , plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor , a number of appealing new animal characters , lots of good music , and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique . It just tells a great story and has beautiful moments of powerful emotion that can bring a tear to the eye even 65 years after it was made . A 1941 Disney animated feature about a harassed little elephant with big ears and his friendship with an imaginative mouse . A Disney animation classic for all ages and all times . You will believe an elephant can cry . It 's a decent story , deemed a `` classic '' by many , but definitely not one of Disney 's best . Touching , comic , visually inventive and emotionally convincing , this remains a jewel in the crown of Disney 's golden age . Another magical experience that will have the mother 's crying and the kids cheering ! 	Dumbo packs plenty of story into its brief runtime , along with all the warm animation and wonderful music you 'd expect from a Disney classic .
gigi It 's easy to drift away from the story and become absorbed in Minnelli 's impossibly delicate textures , but there is a little something here for everybody . So artificial it threatens to collapse , but nice to look at A quintessential Minnelli musical , a morally ambiguous , sophisticated tale of Parisian decadence , done in sumptuous MGM style , Gigi is the biggest commercial hit of Minnelli and Arthur Freed 's lengthy collaboration . A gorgeous musical that lacks the nuance and emotion of other films in its genre . A charming entertainment . A silly feel-good film , nothing that happens is in the least bit surprising . One of the last great musicals to be written especially for the screen . ... one of Hollywood 's most celebrated classics from an era when studios were still making meticulous , tune-filled musicals . Chevalier and Caron 's charms and a bubbly score -- tres chic A charming delight . 	It may not be one of Vincente Minnelli 's best , but the charming and flawlessly acted Gigi still offers enough visual and musical treats to satisfy .
karate kid A warm-heartened riff on the tried-and-true Rocky formula , and one of the better cinematic icons of the 1980s . Upbeat , sentimental and predictable tale , but the acting of Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita ( who was Oscar-nominated ) is good and their friendship charming . Macchio rises above the trite script to deliver a sympathetic and believable performance . Morita is equally good value and look out , too , for Elisabeth Shue in an early role . Formulaic , manipulative , hokey and thoroughly rousing the film 's sincerity and poignance have a way of steamrolling over gaps in plausibility and logic . Irresistible wish fulfillment . The movie birthed three sequels and features the sweet relationship between Macchio and Morita . This is the kind of movie where you find yourself cheering even though you know you 're being hoodwinked . While this may be as soppy and predictable as they come , it still reminds you why you used to enjoy '80s teen flicks so much in the first place . The Karate Kid exhibits warmth and friendly , predictable humor , its greatest assets . Morita is simply terrific , bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part . 	Utterly predictable and wholly of its time , but warm , sincere , and difficult to resist , due in large part to Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio 's relaxed chemistry .
kites Bollywood 's widest U.S. release to date , hitting 215 stateside screens , is ironically atypical : a romantic melodrama in English , Spanish and Hindi , with nary a dance number . Basu strictly observes the B-movie convention of giving the audience an embrace , explosion , or chase sequence at regular intervals . If you do n't like the genre , wait three minutes . By the third act , you find the characters and story growing on you and the romance , despite the histrionics , moving . Kites is , essentially , a love story . With exploding cars . Kites morphs into an action picture , complete with unfathomable chase scenes and a Thelma & Louise ending that is laugh-out-loud hilarious . Often terrible , yet completely engrossing film from Indian director Anurag Basu . a straight-to-video tale that somehow mysteriously managed to find its way to the silver screen . Kites pulls no punches in its histrionic story of love and revenge . It also spares no expense in the telling with the cast of primarily Hindi actors gnashing their way through a beautifully stylish production and several large-scale action set pieces . Kites is an aromatic , cinematic Indian mutton stew -- if that sounds different from usual movie fare , it is . It 's a Bollywood mixture of romance , violence , action , music , and differing cultures and languages . Kites flutters and plummets . It 's a film that proves the concept `` overwrought '' is the same in every language . 	Thoroughly overwrought in true Bollywood fashion , Kites is deeply flawed -- and too effervescently charming to resist .
take the lead As even the film 's dance students note in an aside designed to preempt exactly this criticism , this Michelle Pfeiffer plot is corny . To Sir with Love with dance lessons ... This rainbow coalition of sassy students appears to be the only troublesome pupils in the inner city high school Take the Lead is pure entertainment , if only for the endless amusement of watching Banderas spread the gospel of ballroom like he was born wearing a tuxedo . Liz Friedlander 's `` Take the Lead '' is a fine example of how all the good intentions in the world ca n't make a poorly conceived movie good , though a good central performance can at least make it bearable . Ballroom dancing ... Is there anyone else out there who things we should give it a rest ? The poster says 'Never follow ' , while the movie itslef follows every cliche in the book . Like its star , the movie verges on hooey but cuts too stylish a swath to dislike for long . Si , Antonio is a charming man , but by the final bows the movie around him is all left feet and bruised angles , and much more of a farrago than a fandango . Feels like a product , with decisions made for audience appeal rather than creativity . A feel-good story using music and dance to guide problem kids onto the straight and narrow ... ..entertaining , although not the showstopper we might hope for 	Banderas is charismatic in the lead , and the dance sequences are captivating , but the story is too familiar and predictable .
paprika A spectacular experience , full of bizarre , frightening and beautiful dream logic . The mostly 2-D animation is top-notch quality , and it is a fascinating idea . My advice ? Enter your own dream state , and surrender your brain . Sit back and enjoy the detail-rich visuals while appreciating the unfettered imagination at work in constructing them . Becomes far more enthralling ... the more one simply surrenders to the awe-inspiring beauty of Kon 's images of flesh , metal and unhinged mental delusions . Just go with it , drink in the rich and innovative images , and wish that you could remember your own dreams as well as you 'll remember `` Paprika . '' Manages to create a comfort zone for both Tarzan and Freud . [ Satoshi ] Kon mixes visual beauty with disorienting perspectives for a cautionary tale about machine-influenced soullessness and the persistent Japanese popular love of the cute . ... the experience is as beautifully baffling as any that you 'll have wide awake . [ An ] above-average Japanese anime sci-fi pic . 	Following its own brand of logic , Paprika is an eye-opening mind trip that is difficult to follow but never fails to dazzle .
10012136-winters bone If you enjoy good movie-making , excellent characters and a tightly wrought story then Winter 's Bone is the film for you . Make no bones about it , this is first-rate stuff . The main reason for Winter 's Bone to exist is that it delivers a little voyeuristic thrill -- a bit of poverty porno -- for the critics who awarded it their highest honors at this year 's Sundance Film Festival . Un retrato realista , crudo y duro de ambientes y personajes que viven al margen de la sociedad , de la ley y la moral , y que crece en intensidad como un thriller de suspenso . Estupendas actuaciones de Jennifer Lawrence y John Hawkes . The way Lawrence captures a young woman 's fear and resolve , often non-verbally , well ... this is a considerable talent well on her way to a great career . A masterpiece , and a gem worthy of Oscar gold ... ... a deeply naturalistic brand of high lonesome noir . ... slow but fascinating ... Winter 's Bone is the best film of the year . If the film lacks a certain pinch of mesmerizing drama , it makes up the difference with an exquisite lived-in quality . A frightening , yet crookedly poetic realism . 	Bleak , haunting , and yet still somehow hopeful , Winter 's Bone is writer-director Debra Granik 's best work yet -- and it boasts an incredible , starmaking performance from Jennifer Lawrence .
casino jack and the united state of money Had someone fire-bombed an annual college-Republicans ' meeting in the early 1980s , he would have spared this country a lot of pain and strife . Gibney is a busy boy , and he draws the lines between Abramoff and his friends -- and his friends ' friends -- with the documentary equivalent of a highlighter . The big absence here is the man himself ; Gibney could n't get the jailed Abramoff on camera , either due to unwillingness or a Justice Department intervention . Whatever the reason , it 's crippling . You need to see this movie . You need to see it not just from an historical perspective of hypocrisy laid bare , but as a cautionary tale . Gibney takes a labyrinthine , detail-laden story and crafts an attention-holding film , polemical without ranting . Picture a dry PowerPoint presentation , divided into chapters with a fade-to-black screen scrawled with cutesy titles . Are we short-changed with this doc ? You can bet on it . Most of the anecdotes ( and there are many ) are as juicy and compelling as they are plain-old horrifying . It makes plain , from the outset , its position as an expos-cum-condemnation of our political system as inherently flawed with regard to the relationship between lobbyists , politicians , and policy . With considerable attention to detail , the doc takes the view that Congress is influenced by cash . What a surprise ! A morose but instructive story about the destructive influence of money -- and fanaticism -- on American government . 	Casino Jack 's subject matter is enraging , but in the hands pf director Alex Gibney , it 's also well-presented and briskly entertaining .
10008621-run fat boy run Give me this type of writing any day over some of the inane scripts that plague a Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler flick . Simon Pegg can hold his own with any comic working today . [ The movie ] may not [ provide ] an onslaught of gut-busting laughs , but the humor that does come forth is heartier and more authentic . Depends on the charm of its leading man . But that proves a commodity which , in Pegg 's case , proves to be not only in short supply but positively out of stock . Enough already . I mean , I do n't have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests . But if I wanted to see a really funny one , I 'd rent a Rocky movie . Pacing is brisk , the laughs frequent . With an ending corny and Capra-esque , 'Run , Fat Boy , Run ' charms right to the finish line . I would n't believe that Run Fat Boy Run was co-written by Simon Pegg if he were n't up there on the screen in teeny briefs and with his gut stuck out , trying to endear himself to the American audience in material maybe a notch above Rob Schneider 's . ... excessive product-placement has turned the film into one enormous ad for Nike , with all the chilling humourlessness that this implies . ... a mess of sentimental cliches ... Predictable and conventionally anti-American . An enjoyable if patchy and predictable ride , but Simon Pegg shows he 's more than capable of going the distance . 	Run , Fat Boy , Run features sporadic laughs , but is ultimately too formulaic and predictable .
hidalgo It 's hard these days to associate Viggo Mortensen with words like 'adequate , ' 'competent , ' or 'workmanlike . ' Bold , exuberant and swashbuckling , it has the purity and simplicity of something Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn might have bounded through . Popcorn for us and oats for the horses , delivered by the tall drink of water that is Mortensen . An enjoyable ride , as long as you do n't take it seriously . Even considering its derivative nature , Hidalgo offers adventure , exotic locations , magnificent horses , a love story and heroics at every turn and that 's what great matinee-style entertainment is all about . Even when it stretches credibility to the breaking point , Hidalgo is a larger-than-life adventure with a brisk pace and a charismatic star . It could have been a good adventure story . Disney should have stuck to Hopkins 's story whether it was true or not . Formulaic , overly simple , too violent for tweens . An intermittently savory stew of Pecos Bill , Laurence of Arabia , and Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron . Memories of movies past trot through Hidalgo , but with all the substance of a mirage ... .Mortensen plays Hopkins , a cross between the Marlboro Man and Indiana Jones . 	The scenery looks great , but this overstuffed horse story contains too much cheese .
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring Once you 've got your breath back one thought will prove hard to escape : George Lucas might have a few sleepless nights between now and 2003 . This Lord reigns . The bulk of thanks should really go to Peter Jackson , who has obviously lavished much love on this project with respect for the source material . A fantasy achievement where the action , the characters and the message are equally strong . Most importantly , it leaves us hungry for The Two Towers . Every frame of Fellowship bursts with finesse and imagination , demonstrating what miracles a moviemaker can accomplish with his head , hands and heart fully engaged . As an allegory of war and world dominance , Ring is weighty stuff , and Jackson gives it appropriate resonance . Whatever it is that makes great movies stand apart from great theater or great literature , this film has it . Prueba fehaciente de que la creatividad y el empeo de su director son ms que sobrados . I 'm chimed to see it again and am hanging for the next one . Jackson 's not only done it , he 's created cinematic history too . The franchise cometh . 	Full of eye-popping special effects , and featuring a pitch-perfect cast , The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring brings J.R.R . Tolkien 's classic to vivid life .
ushpizin Dryly funny and richly humane , Ushpizin marries biblical simplicity to secular banality to depict an everyday miracle of devotion rewarded . As a portrayal of a heretofore invisible culture , it 's an important and welcome cinematic milestone . A touching and amusing tale that expands our horizon and also should open our hearts . Explores a world most of us know little or nothing about , and does it respectfully . Laughs , tears and mitzvahs ensue , as the deceptively simple story yields a generous amount of illumination and uplift . The wonderful chemistry between Rand and Bat Sheva Rand , his real-life wife , suggest that in some cases love may prove stronger than the dictates of religious orthodoxy . A gently comedic parable that offers a unique view of a cloistered society while addressing themes of faith , family and friendship that are universal . Pity that the story behind the making of Ushpizin is more interesting than the film itself . Viewers who are n't familiar with Orthodox Jewish culture might have trouble fully relating to this Israeli film . But everyone should be able to appreciate its heartwarming tone . Devout and delightful . That 's a rare one-two punch for a feature film . Ushpizin pulls it off . 	Ushpizin offers a rare and warmly intimate look into ultra-Orthodox Jewish culture .
colour-me-kubrick The movie is endless even at less than 90 minutes . The decision to execute the story as a kind of extended meta-sitcom -- a series of set-ups without the tidy resolution -- feels like a cheat . A shapeless , low-grade comedy of flamboyance , giggling at Conway 's histrionics and fishnet gloving . ... entertaining if not exactly enlightening . This is a kicky little movie . The script evinces no interest in the psychology of its main character . Once the movie gets started , it does n't know where to go or how to end . It more or less repeats itself . It 's no 'Six Degrees of Separation ' but Malkovich charms the audience as much as his marks , making this solid sit-com entertainment Scarcely an insightful biographical portrait , Color Me Kubrick is still interesting , perhaps even intimidating , as a study of the way fandom can so readily be turned against itself . Without much insight into the self-dramatizing enigma of Conway , nor any representation of the solitary auteur he impersonated , the film becomes a repetitive series of small-scale con games played on cabdrivers , bar owners and wannabe stars . 	Colour Me Kubrick has a fascinating premise , but provides little insight into Kubrick and the man who impersonated him .
american werewolf in london This movie presented a radical melange of genuine horror and self-aware comic touches , not to mention the fabulous Rick Baker special effects . When the movie backfires , which it finally does , it 's because too much grisly footage has been used too lightly . Director John Landis brings humor to this offbeat reworking of the familiar tale for which Rick Baker received a well deserved Oscar for his makeup ( in the first year of that category ) . Spare and clean , with an uncluttered look rare for a horror film . Carnivorous lunar activities rarely come any more entertaining than this . But in a `` comedy horror '' picture , the `` horror '' bits are n't supposed to be this scary . He would have been better off dispensing with the comedy altogether . Not just gory but actually frightening , not just funny but clever , 'American Werewolf ... ' has its flaws , but these are outweighed by the film 's many , mighty strengths . By the time the credits roll , Landis has given us the goods , but more importantly , he 's given us a good story . few movies had mixed comedy and horror with such utter aplomb Some of the special effects are a little creaky now , but the snap of Landis 's editing and the razor's-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh . 	Terrifying and funny in almost equal measure , John Landis ' horror-comedy crosses genres while introducing Rick Baker 's astounding make-up effects .
harold and kumar go to white castle If you want to laugh loud and long , go see it . But for heaven 's sake , check your tender sensibilities at the door . Goes for cheap and easy laughs way too frequently . A funny stoner buddy movie , with nods to those original multicultural high times guys , Cheech and Chong , and flashes of the kind of party-on comedy that Saturday Night Live slackers Wayne and Garth made most excellent . It is n't just another dumb druggie flick that suggests the world begins and ends with getting high . Harold and Kumar just need to go , period ! This is one more 'youth movie ' that 'll put years on anyone over 25 . Director Danny Leiner has now elevated the stoner comedy to its highest peak ... as far as stoner comedies go , this is a surprisingly well-done affair What could have just pushed the usual youth comedy buttons is instead a crafty spoof on issues from racial politics to American highway monoculture that belies its cover ( and marketing ) as only a dumb gross-out laffer . It 's what a stoner comedy should be . It 's what a buddy comedy should be . Two for the price of one sure as hell ai n't bad . . . the funniest thing I 've seen in months . 	The likable leads and subversion of racial stereotypes elevate Harold and Kumar above the typical stoner comedy .
last emperor Provides good info on its subject matter , but does so without emotional engaging its audience . At last a real , thought-provoking , eyeball-popping movie epic . One of the most visually arresting pictures of recent years . Grand and powerful . Bernardo Bertolucci 's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an astonishing , ravishing and smashing film ... And it 's a glorious production which won 9 Oscars - that 's every major category for which it is eligible The best I can say for it is that it is a smart epic , and I think it will age very well . Constantly absorbing and tremendously interesting . The man , who only has been superficially shown , gets lost for a while in the sweep of events . Yet in spite of these reservations , this lush film merits attention . The small screen does n't quite do justice to the rich visuals but with an incredible story and fine performances , it is still a compulsive and moving epic . That rare breed of film that is both pure Oscar bait and a thoroughly compelling work . 	While decidedly imperfect , Bernardo Bertolucci 's epic is still a feast for the eyes .
yes men fix the world A resounding Yes for the Yes Men . A middling Maybe for The Yes Men Fix the World . The film , though brave , gonzo and often funny , raises the bar on the debate provoked by Michael Moore and Sacha Baron Cohen . How cruel does satire have to be - to innocent and guilty alike - to accomplish its missions ? You ca n't fool all of the people all the time , but maybe the Yes Men can trick enough of them into doing what 's right . When a British Channel 4 interviewer upbraids Bichlbaum for providing massively false hopes to countless Bhopal residents , I found myself siding with the interviewer , not the prankster with the alleged higher moral purpose . The Yes Men 's bravery and unflagging sense of optimistically doomed humor -- which comes across as a quixotic version of Monty Python by way of Upton Sinclair -- is to be applauded and , wherever possible , acted upon . Most of the ideas are admirable and pretty funny . A smart , thoughtful examination not only of the morality of capitalism , but of comedy - the Yes Men fret over the ethics of their prankery with a rigour that their corporate adversaries could learn something from . You have to admire their ability both to pull off these stunts and to extract such honest expressions of greed from such corporate victims . This is a movie that does little more than preach to the converted . It 's mildly amusing at times , but ultimately pointless . Optimistic and constantly amusing , the Yes Men are a force for the good . That , plus the knowledge that many of those free marketeering goons will have been crushed in the credit crunch , makes this a guilt-edged pleasure . 	The Yes Men aim their barbs at the capitalist fat-cats with gutsy and hilarious performance pranks .
hills have eyes 2 There is not any plot worth discussing : people go into a desert , some die . The end . The only folks jumping out of their seats are the ones going for a drink refill . Reasonably effective , although the low budget frequently peers through in the uninspired set design and laughably obvious bluescreen work . Maybe it 's just time to put an end to this mutant circle of life , or at least send it straight to DVD from now on . A nastily effective piece of action-horror , as reflective of its time and its war as the Vietnam-era Deliverance was of its time and war . In case you miss what 's happening , one soldier wails , 'Oh , man , we 're gettin ' picked off one by one , here . ' As far as stuff like mood , atmosphere , tone , and intensity is concerned , this sequel is a completely empty vessel . Pure genre-pic boredom . This team 's descent is soon revealed as cockamamie : they 're no longer trained fighters with automatic guns but victims in a splatter movie . I ca n't even bring myself to say , drop in , turn your brain off and enjoy , as the material presented is just not anywhere near as entertaining as the first run . 	The Hills Have Eyes 2 is a completely unoriginal sequel offers plenty of gore and clichs , but few scares .
memento An engaging brainteaser , even if the solution is a bit of a letdown . A con in the mode of Bryan Singer 's The Usual Suspects -- the scam of the year . It seems less than the sum of its time-slicing moves . Pearce ... dominates the picture through his feral performance . Memento is a deliciously taut film noir with more twists than a Twizzler . Those who stay with it will experience perhaps the most dazzling film released so far this year . Memento 's boldest stroke is its ingenious synthesis of structure and theme . This is one of the best movies I 've seen in years . I have n't felt as exhilarated coming out of a movie since 1998 . This is a sparkling but forgettable film . A convoluted tour-de-force . 	Christopher Nolan skillfully guides the audience through Memento 's fractured narrative , seeping his film in existential dread .
naked gun 2 12 the the smell of fear Nielsen 's secret is that he does almost nothing , and certainly nothing he seems to think is funny . Ribald , wild Zucker comedy with Leslie Nielsen in usual wild form . This sequel might feel like a simple reworking of the first film if Leslie Nielsen were n't so consistently appealing in his role as Frank Drebin . Somehow this sequel never reaches the heights of inspired lunacy that made the original so memorable , and there are no extended set-pieces that work as well as the first film 's opening battle with America 's enemies or the climactic baseball game . What 's at work here is the comedy law of diminishing returns : if you tell the same jokes over and over and over again , they become less and less and less funny . An even sequel that misses the freshness of the original or the TV series . In the limbo of comedy , few can go lower than Zucker without visibly straining . Not quite as fresh as the first . Amusing even if the law of diminishing returns is starting to kick in . No joke is passed up or thrown away . There just might be a little too much . 	The slapstick antics of this sequel provide a few laughs , but fail to equal those of the original .
state and main A great film about making bad movies . One of the year 's smartest and funniest films . Mamet 's most easy going and fun-loving film to date . From start to finish , State and Main has so few lulls and so many memorable parts that it 's hard not to be hungry for more after it 's over . By the end , you 'll wish they 'd actually made a movie called The Old Mill , because seeing what went behind the scenes will have completely intrigued you . An amusing trifle . ... without a doubt one of the most well written scripts in the past few years . In this age when dumb , broad , easy-to-market comedy continues to rule , Mr. Mamet 's literary wit is always welcome . One giant testimony to unmet potential . Has some very funny moments but does n't hit the mark , largely because its notions of Hollywood seem either dated or false . 	State and Main offers plenty of wit and laughs in its lampoons of the movie industry .
dennis the menace Mr. Hughes and Mr. Castle try hard to re-create a kind of timeless , idealized comic-strip atmosphere , but except for the performances of Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton ... nobody in the movie seems in touch with the nature of the comedy . Its unholy mixture of peppy sadism and pious , self-righteous sentiment comes straight from Hughes ' crabbed cinematic heart . John Hughes ' vision of Dennis is much more menacing than Ketcham 's fans and parents of small children might reasonably expect . Very young children may find the numskull , by-the-numbers gags here amusing , but teens will consider this kids ' stuff and adults will be pained . A smooth blend of sentiment and slapstick . Those good qualities are undermined , unfortunately , by the Switchblade Sam character , who is dirty , threatening and scary . A movie that makes you leave the theatre with thoughts of having yourself , and your neighbors , spayed is not a good thing . Most children will get a kick out of it , although adults roped into accompanying their offspring may find themselves yearning to escape through the nearest exit . But it 's all far too flabby , with lengthy setups that seem to go on forever . Some judicious editing to tighten up the film could have made all the difference in the overall pacing . The comic has been condensed into a sweet-naturedly nutty motion picture with the buoyancy of a clutch of colored balloons . 	Walter Matthau does a nice job as Mr. Wilson , but Dennis the Menace follows the Home Alone formula far too closely .
control room More illuminating than not , and shines its brightest light on a truth that war and warmongers so ferociously ignore : Look hard into the other 's camp and what you 'll likely see is yourself . Biased and boring . Enlightening , if structurally relaxed documentary . Offers us a fierce yet often surprisingly friendly debate about the clashing ways in which the U.S. invasion and takeover of Iraq have been portrayed by American and Arab journalists , placing matters in context . Reveals the humanity of the opponents on both sides ... and government 's attempt to deny that humanity at all costs . Jehane Noujaim utilizes an easy observational style to get her point across . While it provides some insight into the Arab perspective on the war , Control Room is a mere peek inside a window that would benefit from being thrown wide open . `` Control Room '' is more than just a compelling film . It 's a public service . Americans watch CNN . The Arab world watches Al-Jazeera . This movie watches both and helps us understand how no attempt or pretense of objectivity can ever escape bias . Is Al Jazeera perfect ? Certainly not , but when you watch how they put together their news , you realize that the best journalism during the war was n't coming from the US . 	A fascinating , enlightening behind-the-scenes look at the Al Jazeera network .
cinderella 2013 [ VIDEO ESSAY ] Branagh 's well-steeped history of producing , directing , and acting in film versions of Shakespeare 's plays echoes in the context of a much beloved , ( formerly animated ) children 's classic . Filmgoers need another fairy tale flick about as much as they need another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel ( oops , too late ) , yet Cinderella swiftly casts aside all doubts and derision to reveal itself as a particularly enchanting piece of cinema . Enchanting and beautifully filmed . Disney 's live action translation of their 1950 animated classic is the perfect family movie . A great cast includes the stunning Lily James and a complex evil Stepmother from the great Cate Blanchett . For all its gossamer , gauze , filigree and refinement , `` Cinderella '' drags when it should skip as lightly as its title character when she 's late getting home from the ball . Turn back the clock on filmmaking and get ready to be charmed by `` Cinderella . '' Director Kenneth Branagh has outdone himself with this outstanding live-action version of the 1950 Disney animated classic . 'Cinderella ' is made of Disney magic . The actors in the film all give strong performances . This film is gorgeously staged with wonderful costumes , sets and production design . Scenic locations are expertly lensed by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos . In being faithful to the traditional tale interpreted by Disney in their animated 1950 classic , this Cinderella is crisp escapist enjoyment . I suppose I just was n't wowed by it . Cinderella was exactly what I expected , which means it lived up to my expectations . Darlings , just breathless with the news : Kenneth Branagh 's Cinderella is a sumptuous , candy-coloured rush of romance , with added thespian backbone from Cate Blanchett as the evil stepmother . 	Refreshingly traditional in a revisionist era , Kenneth Branagh 's Cinderella proves Disney has n't lost any of its old-fashioned magic .
adjustment bureau It 's impossible to avoid comparing this film to both Inception and The Truman Show , as it delves into the issue of free will from a fantastical perspective . But this is a lighter movie , focussing on romance rather than weighty themes . Philip K. Dick does n't always work on screen Suspenseful , romantic and wryly funny , `` The Adjustment Bureau '' is the kind of film that reaffirms one 's faith in Hollywood . With its different genres and better than most movies in the theater at present it probably will not disappoint . Decent enough science-fiction silliness that could have done without the religious malarkey . The Adjustment Bureau is smartly scripted and slickly directed , and is anchored by yet another compelling performance from the ever reliable Matt Damon . The actors convincingly sell that passion , and their union smoothes any wrinkles an otherwise critical eye might spy as `` The Adjustment Bureau '' ... races along . Blunt and Damon have delightful chemistry , but this is still little more than a derivative , campy B-movie , which would be fine if it was at all what the filmmakers had intended . Damon and Blunt are great -- it 's just a shame they do n't have a stronger adversary for their love . [ VIDEO ] The simplicity works . 	First-time writer/director George Nolfi struggles to maintain a consistent tone , but The Adjustment Bureau rises on the strong , believable chemistry of its stars .
other boleyn girl With The Other Boleyn Girl , the sheen and shine of the clothing and sets ca n't quite blind us to the fact there 's very little drama under all the drapery , and you 'll recall the textures of the fabrics long after you 've forgotten the threads of the plot . Well done and beautifully produced . Satisfactorily explains the incest charge against Anne Boleyn . This rendering of the turbulent second marriage of England 's King Henry VIII ( Eric Bana ) proves too heavy-footed for the old movie two-step of setting up a morality tale , then exploiting it for heat and titillation . Set your bosoms to heave and prepare to have your bodices ripped : `` The Other Boleyn Girl '' is in the house with a pair of 16th century foxes . There are moments when you can see how terrific this film could have been ... a slightly steamy , highly romanticized period melodrama with real movie stars and a commensurate costume budget . Fascinating in its depiction of a troubled relationship between sisters that is anything but black and white . This emotionally ripe angle to a tragic story that could have been told any number of ways is where the film gets its potency . Feels like an Oscar-bait title that somehow got its DNA mixed up with a daytime soap opera . A rather titillating take on a racy historical novel , this is perhaps too ambitious in intent . More time , or more pruning ( perhaps they should just have focused on The Boleyn girl ) , would have produced a richer and more enjoyable film . Feminist subtext aside , the movie is primarily an excuse for ogling some blue-chip actor-flesh . 	Though it features some extravagant and entertaining moments , The Other Boleyn Girl feels more like a soap opera than historical drama .
district 9 Since the metaphor itself is pretty clear , Blomkamp goes for the visceral quality of the images and situations . Funny and ferocious , cynical and satirical , District 9 is both ingeniously clever and smartly thoughtful ... The coolest , most intelligent action movie of the year . It 's visually striking and provides an adrenaline rush , but it also has a brain . ... a speculative fiction with genuine emotional resonance . While a solid actioner , what makes it so special is a human heart that propels this wham-bam sci-fi film straight into deepest six-star territory . Director Neill Blomkamp expertly marshals the action , and although the climactic exchanges settle into familiar territory , he provokes genuine moral outrage . A sci-fi original . The result is like a two-stage booster rocket , propelled by a tricky structure , deft style and original scenario before settling into the sort of orbit any fanboy could recognize and appreciate . For a movie rife with violence and disturbing imagery , District 9 has a guiding spirit that 's surprisingly sweet and even hokey . But that 's part of its charm . District 9 opens the door to a new and thrilling vision of the sci-fi genre . It 's a genuinely unique and compelling cinematic reflection of our times . 	Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching , District 9 has action , imagination , and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic .
cold mountain A rapturous , moving experience that 's filled with drama , comedy , music , and action . Rises and falls on the strength of its individual sections and , just as crucially , on the judgment of the actors who populate each . Minghella crafts a complex and entertaining two-and-a-half hours with a cast who play their roles perfectly . Like a secular version of Ben Hur without the chariot race , Jude Law 's character keeps going via the inspiration of a brief encounter with Ada Monroe So full of hot air , any emotion is blown away -- gone , with the wind . Cold Mountain is a movie of episodes , and Minghella pulls off dazzling set pieces : he knows how to infuse violence with emotion , so it never seems gratuitous . Civil War story of love and struggle is a carefully , expertly crafted piece of Oscar bait that 's still satisfying . Crowded with fascinating supporting characters , who make the long haul -- the movie clocks in at 2 1/2 hours -- worth attempting . Sometimes impressive , often exciting , but never delivers the home run we 're expecting . A good-looking but dull and eccentrically cast romantic drama set during American civil war . 	The well-crafted Cold Mountain has an epic sweep and captures the horror and brutal hardship of war .
drag me to hell Raimi puts his pent-up energy to good use in Drag Me to Hell , an unpretentious horror hoot that 's scary and funny in equal measure . [ Blu-ray ] Was I having fun ? My dears , I was not . I was simply longing -- longing ! -- for it all to be over . Gleefully goosing the juice on this ride , Sam Raimi delivers his best film in more than a decade . The brothers Grimm would take pride in this cautionary fable flooded with formaldehyde , flies and more funky-denture action than seemingly possible . Sam Raimi is back in close to prime form with this week 's thoroughly enjoyable Drag Me To Hell , a horror thrill ride almost certain to satisfy any audience member willing to choose a movie with `` Hell '' in the title over the latest Pixar offering . The looseness Raimi allows himself here results in an especially joyous kind of filmmaking , the sort where the filmmaker 's delight in scaring us ( and making us laugh ) becomes part of the movie 's fabric . A spine-tingling adventure guaranteed to elicit blood-curdling screams and to make you jump out of your seat when you least expect it . A frenetic , gross and darkly slapstick trip into Hell . Fans of Army Of Darkness era Raimi will love this . While it 's fun to see Raimi goofing around with horror again , it 's nothing to get overly excited about . Lohman takes a Bruce Campbell-style beating through Raimi 's wonderful world of swoop-cams , attacking furniture and pus-spewing creatures ... Take a deep sigh of relief , horror fans . Sam 's back ! Not only is it genuinely scary , it 's also outrageously funny . And for once , it 's intentional . 	Sam Raimi returns to top form with Drag Me to Hell , a frightening , hilarious , delightfully campy thrill ride .
balzac and the little chinese seamstress [ A ] big , beautifully photographed and somewhat mushy film . Manages big magic with a few simple elements . Skillfully done ... but the broader historical context may make one just a tad queasy reveling in its visual and emotional excesses . The film is episodic , and most of the scenes are evocative and charming . The real star here is the Chinese landscape , which is lush and inviting . Cinematographer Jean-Marie Dreujou and his crews have done a good job of capturing its beauty . Its well-earned humanistic frissons should serve as a wake-up call for the great majority of American movies , with their inexhaustible supply of smugness and complacency . There 's something mildly seductive about its linking of passion with the wild , untamable jungle that envelops its characters . A poignant lyricism runs through Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . ... an unusual angle on the era , and a passionate paean to the power of books , ideas and art . Dai 's episodic treatment has the force of memory , equally embracing the beautiful , the bittersweet and the absurd . 	This delicately told fable about the power of literature is a lyrical delight .
art and craft Landis is a lanky , quiet-spoken wisp of a man , his skull firm against the taut skin of his face , and sly amusement suffuses almost every pronouncement in a whispery , Truman Capote-like voice that is as still and clear as a bell . an engaging character study with an awkward yet satisfying climax that could n't be scripted more perfectly . `` Nothing 's original under the sun , '' muses Mark Landis in the consistently compelling documentary `` Art and Craft . '' But he seems to be discounting himself . Sam Cullman , Jennifer Grausman , and Mark Becker , the directors of `` Art and Craft , '' have themselves an enticing subject in Landis 's activities . They do not have an enticing subject in Landis himself . Fascinatingly complex and endlessly entertaining documentary ... a film which , by measures , both intrigues and tickles you . There 's a hint of exploitation , but it does n't overpower the film 's hilarious insights into the smug pretentiousness of the art world , nor its riveting examination of how copying others as made Landis an endearing original . Perhaps the year 's most delightfully charming documentary . This documentary about one of the most prolific forgers in history is a fascinating character study of two men , the forger , a man compelled to copy works of art and pass them off as originals , and the man compelled to stop him from from doing that . Landis has made a lot of people very angry , and the movie deals with a serious issue - namely the way obsessions take control of us . Art and Craft rightly supposes that critique of art-establishment phoniness never gets old , and it reveals how individual mental illness can manifest collective anxiety about cultural ideals . 	The spotlight it shines on an apparently troubled mind may strike some viewers as exploitative , but Art and Craft remains a thoroughly gripping glimpse into the life of a legendary art forger .
mash That it 's is so much of its moment does n't mean that it 's aged poorly ... it 's brash enough and inventive enough to still feel like a work of radicalism , more than 40 years on , It 's Altman at his irreverent , hilarious best . Clever camera setups , Altman 's patented overlapping dialogue , wonderful sight gags and situations , and universally fine ensemble performances combine to make this one the most enjoyable war-themed films ever . The quality of this acerbic study of life in a Korean War field hospital has been too often overlooked because of the popularity of the TV series it spawned . A black comedy that rings hollow today . Altman 's irreverent portrait of a Korean War medical unit . As a savage comedy about man 's rebellion in the face of death it has rarely been bettered . One of Altman 's bona-fide masterpieces . Even better than the subsequent TV show . ( Easily . ) What lingers is the Army 's sexism . At first it 's exposed but the story soon indulges in the humiliation of women . M*A*S*H* remains enjoyably irreverent but falls well short of the counterculture , anti-establishment war-satire it could 've been . Before ... the next war , both sides need to hire Altman as the director . He knows the territory , works with ensemble casts better than anyone , and provides plenty of laughs . 	Bold , timely , subversive , and above all funny , M*A*S*H remains a high point in Robert Altman 's distinguished filmography .
honeydripper The large cast is admirable , but the joint does n't so much jump as shuffle earnestly from foot to foot . Honeydripper is an electrifying period piece about how music can bring folks together and generally save one 's soul -- or at least its final 15 minutes is . The rest of the time , it 's just a lot of sassy talk and scenery . Although Honeydripper won a screenplay award at the San Sebastin Film Festival , it 's not Sayles ' strongest work . Part of the problem is that it keeps building to a rock-'n'-roll payoff that never quite arrives . John Sayles returns with another literate , professional , yet highly enjoyable film . Honeydripper is a pleasant enough story , but when Sayles is involved , it is a shock to feel so little . Honeydripper , directed by John Sayles , is a shambling fusion of pop mythology and social mosaic . John Sayles , after 27 years and 16 films , is the ancient mariner of independent cinema , navigating the constantly swirling waters of the genre with passion and skill . The scenes involving musical performances ... are the best parts of the movie , and it would be much enriched if there were more of them . It 's awfully difficult not to be drawn into this refreshingly low-key and simple tale . Written and directed by the indefatigable indie idol John Sayles , the movie is well-acted , but it 's as talky as if it were written for the stage , with fatally slow pacing . 	Honeydripper 's electric musical numbers and sharp performances make for an exciting film , despite its slow pace .
a separation 2011 While the specifics are rooted in Iranian culture , the broad strokes are entirely universal -- it 's an intelligent , intriguing and inviting film . The movie is a singular mix of the foreign and the familiar , but is it the best 2011 film in the whole wide world ? A 99 ? I ca n't say that I concur with my colleagues on that score . It 's fast paced , exciting , thrilling , edgy , moving , engaging , and - in its portrait of a justice system almost radically alien to the one I live under - absolutely fascinating . Tensely involving Iranian drama with niche potential . 'A Separation ' is lively and suspenseful as both drama and debate . It 's the little moments in Farhadi 's film that are its most important , speaking every bit as loudly as its big , narrative-driving moments . Beyond the impeccable performances and direction , it 's foremost an exceptional piece of screenwriting , so finely wrought that the drama seems guided by an invisible hand . Above all , Farhadis parable teaches that a rush to judgment inevitably turns back on the judge . It 's a thrilling domestic drama that offers acute insights into human motivations and behavior as well as a compelling look at what goes on behind a particular curtain that almost never gets raised . Director Asghar Farhadi torques each twist of the intricate narrative with jewelled precision . Right under the noses of the theocratic regime , he has made a family drama inlaid with a sly critique of Iran 's obdurate patriarchy . 	Morally complex , suspenseful , and consistently involving , A Separation captures the messiness of a dissolving relationship with keen insight and searing intensity .
the descendants 2011 Sort of like a shotgun marriage between Jimmy Buffett and Harry Chapin . Here 's where I am right now : The Descendants is the best movie of 2011 . It is the movie of the year , in many ways beyond its simple superlative overall excellence . `` The Descendants '' is one of the stranger and yet one of the more effective weepers in recent years . Payne 's exploring new territory , but it also feels like he 's holding himself back , attempting to evolve through repression . ( George ) Clooney gives a complex and complete performance as a man who put his career ahead of his family , and is stumbling to try to reconnect to make his life whole again . Payne , whose early features were set in his native Omaha , has always shown an acute if unconventional sense of place . Clooney has never been better , displaying more range and less actor-ego than ever before ... The Descendants would still be a splendid movie without him ; with Clooney , it 's one of 2011 's very best . Emotionally engaging and frequently funny , this is a satisfying drama with a sharply written script , likeable characters and a terrific performance from George Clooney that 's certain to garner some attention come Oscar time . A tragedy infused with comedy [ that ] calls for a balancing act from filmmaker and star alike , a tightrope they navigate with nary a wobble . Heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking story about love , death , duty and responsibility 	Funny , moving , and beautifully acted , The Descendants captures the unpredictable messiness of life with eloquence and uncommon grace .
monkey kingdom You know how nature docs work . You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya 's lil ' Kip are so durn cuuuuute . Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill , who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names . You 're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones . Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor , it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some . With its sumptuous photography , razor-sharp editing , and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey , `` Monkey Kingdom '' shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people . Monkey Kingdom is delightful , and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you 'll see in this year 's summer blockbusters ... Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny , educational . A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom . Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature 's low point thus far , but that does n't mean it is n't a great time . It 's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules . `` Monkey Kingdom '' is just the latest entertainment to benefit . 	Monkey Kingdom 's breathtaking footage of primates in the wild is likely to please animal lovers of all ages .
the hangover 2 Every time a character in this follow-up groans `` I ca n't believe this is happening again '' , you can only nod forlornly in agreement . Your head hurts like hell , the whole thing feels horribly familiar , and it 's just not funny any more . Can this really be happening again ? The movie exceeds expectations ! The acters carve out a special comedy niche that will not be easily forgotten . They operate like a well-oiled machine with perfect comedic timing and a contagious form of winning camaraderie . The clever lines of ... The Hangover Part II is n't a dud , exactly -- some of it is very funny , and there are a few memorable jolts and outlandish dirty moments . But it feels , at times , like a routine adventure film set overseas . Its sense of fun-loving camaraderie feels forced and tinged with buzz-killing danger . The Hangover Part II gets considerable mileage out of following precisely the same structure as the first film . I think the first one is like GONE WITH THE WIND compared to this tired old turd . This is n't even really a sequel to the hilarious 2009 comedy smash set in Las Vegas . It 's virtually the same movie , just transferred to another continent and with the raunch wildly amped up . Not rotten - just not fresh - following its own raunchy , shenanigan-filled formula . There 's no simply no way to connect with this film on a story basis . 	A crueler , darker , raunchier carbon copy of the first installment , The Hangover Part II lacks the element of surprise -- and most of the joy -- that helped make the original a hit .
girl on the train Feels like two different films cobbled together , without much to connect one to the other ... the disconnect between the two is huge . Andr Tchin 's spellbinding storytelling glosses over the issue somewhat , but never deplorably so . Given several years ' distance from the media blitz , Tchin brings clarity , maturity , and perspective to the case while still subtly addressing all the thorny social issues the affair touched off . The Girl on the Train reverberates with a quiet , seductive power . The Girl on the Train is a bit of a crime caper , but crimes of the heart , indeed , defects of personality , are what veteran filmmaker Tchin is about here , with spotty success . Understated but involving , The Girl On The Train tells a very personal and specific story that resonates with wider insight into the state of modern France . A movie whose blitheness does n't know when to quit . Lacks sufficient focus , plausibility and an emotional core despite being provocative with a terrific ensemble cast and ... milie Dequenne 's charming , radiant performance . A delightfully complex plot brings to life an actual event that consisted of a young woman 's false accusation of an anti-Semitic attack . Though told with verve and acted with diamond-like preciseness , it never plumbs the core of its story , and so risks being as serene and unreflective as Jeanne herself 	It 's a bit of a comedown for director Andr Tchin , but this fact-based drama raises some thorny questions -- and benefits from strong performances by Catherine Deneuve and Emilie Dequenne .
1195800-my winnipeg The film , shot in black and white , like most of Maddin 's creations , is a treat for fans and a migraine for the uninitiated or terminally dull . Guy Maddin 's films are always delightful , but his latest , My Winnipeg , has an added treat for film buffs : It features Ann Savage ! Ingeniously madcap and heartfelt ... more than just a whimsical curiosity , My Winnipeg takes an extraordinary leap forward ... An entrancing riffle through the olde curiosity shoppe of the filmmaker 's psyche . Reality or just another Maddin fever dream , whichever , the images are striking . Restaging his youth but making his own detours , Maddin transforms Winnipeg into a city of mystery . Maddin mixes personal reminiscences with elaborate fantasies of Masonic rituals and collectivist brothels , to construct a vision of Winnipeg as a city of sleepwalkers . My Winnipeg is overloaded and digressive -- it comes with the territory -- but it 's also grounded in a place , Maddin 's Manitoban hometown , and it 's painfully engrossing . A remembrance of things forgotten . Shot in his signature black-and-white , the movie sustains a dreamlike quality that freely allows non sequitur ideas , historical events , and memories to come alive . 	My Winnipeg is a charmingly irreverent 'docu-fantasy ' from the unpredictable mind of Guy Maddin .
1175072-license to wed It is only the latest attempt by a Hollywood studio to pander to prurience and piety in a single gesture , and to avoid giving offense by treating all possible factions of the public equally , which is to say like idiots . The creepy-faced robot twin babies are funny ( for a while ) ; the rest of the film is not . It 's like Meet the Parents with Dr. Phil as the officiant from hell . so lifeless and bland you will only see it when Transformers is sold out and your girlfriend thinks that Jim guy from The Office is cute . It makes marriage look like the biggest mistake of all time , and the multiplex a prison from which there is no escape . Anyone who has been through the process of church-mandated marriage preparation counseling should get a chuckle out of License to Wed , that is if the comedy were n't so badly handled . You know it 's bad when there are more interesting things happening during the outtakes in the closing credits than in the movie itself . No matter how hard I try , I 'm finding it difficult to write anything positive about License to Wed . This movie is bad from top to bottom , front to back , and start to finish . This crude and unfunny comedy represents one of the low points in what has already been a disappointing summer-movie season . Anyone who wanders into License to Wed expecting a sweet-natured romantic comedy is likely to feel like the sensitive surface of that metaphorical tongue : ripped off . Predictable wedding comedy is all about Williams . 	Featuring one of Robin Williams ' most shtick-heavy performances , the broad and formulaic License to Wed wrings little out of its slightly creepy , unappealing premise .
monsoon wedding After awhile all the film 's elaborate charms begin to feel as empty as a Disneyfied fairy tale . Nair keeps the disparate threads of the many interfamily relationships under control and shows just how universal dysfunction can be . Nair and screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan deserve credit for wrapping up this big bundle in such a likeable package backed by such a great musical score . Director Mira Nair pulls together the Indian diaspora in this energetic , charming and occasionally chilling slice of Punjabi life . Fills the eyes brimmingly and , at moments , hits the heart . Monsoon Wedding is not to be missed . Uneven , but worth the trip . All in all , a great party . Funny , smart , perceptive , troubling and ultimately joyous . Mira Nair 's distinctive , wholly engaging approach is somewhere between Dogme-style immediacy and Bollywood-calibre excess . 	An insightful , energetic blend of Hollywood and Bollywood styles , Monsoon Wedding is a colorful , exuberant celebration of modern-day India , family , love , and life .
on the outs Socially relevant and convincing , On The Outs should help to raise awareness that violent crime is no longer a man problem . Granted that On the Outs does n't explore any new realms of destitute city life but it still contains unspeakable moments of desolation and disillusionment . There 's a real-life immediacy to these stories , each of which demands that viewers see beyond such convenient , dehumanizing labels as 'drug dealer , ' 'crackhead ' and 'pregnant teen . ' What makes the film feel genuine , however , are the performances . A work of harrowing , visceral power . The central trio handles the narrative burdens well . A starkly honest and affecting dramatic feature directed by Lori Silverbush and Michael Skolnik . Lori Silverbush and Michael Skolnik 's film must live and die on the strength of its lead performers . Luckily , most of the time they are up to the challenge . Guerilla storytelling on a profound level . Harrowing and heartbreaking , On the Outs is persuasively performed by fine actors , yet has the real feel of a documentary . 	With powerful lead performances , this gritty docudrama about the desperate lives of three young women in Jersey City packs an emotional wallop .
1009113-halloween To call Halloween merely brilliant is n't giving it enough credit . As a horror film and as a historical milestone that single-handedly shaped and altered the future of an entire genre , it 's downright transcendent . After a promising opening , Halloween becomes just another maniac-on-the-loose suspenser . One of the best horror films ever made . John Carpenter deserves a medal for his effective build-up of suspense , his knack for casting and his sensationally-scary Michael Myers ! It 's freaking scary . After a recent viewing , I was charged with going through the house and turning on all the lights . Still relevant . Still scary . Make a date on Halloween night to witness cinema 's scariest Michael Myers ( unless you 've seen The Love Guru ) causing carnage on the big screen . A seminal slasher that gets better with age . [ A ] simple but horribly effective low-budget suburban horror ... Halloween is an absolutely merciless thriller , a movie so violent and scary that , yes , I would compare it to Psycho . Sets the standard for slasher films and horror in general ... ... the kind of fright flick in which the plodding monster has his victim in his grasp and then inexplicably stabs the couch five feet to the right of her . 	Scary , suspenseful , and viscerally thrilling , Halloween set the standard for modern horror films .
upside of anger Always more than a mere by-numbers domestic drama , The Upside of Anger is desperately , darkly funny , with dialogue to , er , die for , and a perfect cast . Allen makes the most of her role -- the tiny scene where she walks in on two certain people in bed with one another is a wondrously sharp statement of total acting commitment . A wonderful , sophisticated romantic comedy about the resilience of love in the face of competing emotions . [ Binder 's ] film is a raging morass of misogyny , a self-congratulatory exercise in mental masturbation . Do n't go into The Upside of Anger expecting the usual convenient and happy Hollywood solution to serious problems . That , to me , is the real upside . Despite Denny 's sturdy support , The Upside of Anger belongs to Terry . Binder creates a familiar , complex , realistic , deeply human dynamic between his characters , and provides each actor rich layers of feeling and humor with which to create them . Can only be described as American Beauty Lite ( and Carb Free ! ) . Perhaps it 's a sign , then , of how starved we are for movies with grown-up characters doing grown-up things that it 's easy to ignore the downside of Upside and give the film a pass . Allen and Costner should find another movie to make together . That anger is explored only superficially and most of the women seem merely to be ornamentation , defined by their problems . 	A comedy/ drama for grown-ups , with fine performances by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner .
pieces of april [ A ] gentle comedy . Laughter and poignancy go hand in hand in this DV debut whose comedy that may be standard , but never ceases to deliver sharp , dark laughs . Hedges peppers it with enough wonderful moments that you ca n't help warming up to it . This delightful little miracle of a movie reminds us of how crucial it is that we appreciate and love each other in spite of our failures , grudges , and disappointments . We 're left feeling those quirky , confused , often unbearably loaded feelings we often get around our families , and the power of the most important one : unconditional love . This is a gem of a film and goes to show that if you have a good story , you do n't have to have millions of dollars to tell it . Like School of Rock , April is n't so much about telling a new story as it is about taking an old story and breathing some fresh air into it . [ Hedges ] plays our emotions like a virtuoso , mixing farce with tragedy with equal assurance and wisely eschewing words when silence can be more effective ..I ca n't stress enough the grace and beauty of Peter Hedges ' haunting picture .. Holmes , Clarkson , and Platt steer the course through the straight and narrow and keep the film from becoming an inedible holiday leftover . 	A delightful , heartfelt comedy .
spy 2015 Spy rarely goes for an easy joke ; there are so many wonderful setups and payoffs . It 's an entertaining piece of silliness , though it looks like a decision has been made to balance out the female star with some weirdly explicit violence and salty cuss-words , perhaps to reassure the male demographic ... This is a comedy with no artistic pretentions , but it delivers exactly what you would expect from it . [ full review in Spanish ] The best comedy about international crime fighting since the heyday of Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery . The screenplay manages to bring to life eccentric and funny characters , like the working duo of McCarthy and Byrne . [ full review in Spanish ] The laughs come flying every which way - conceptually , visually and through a smart and hilarious script that ambushes us with off the wall humour as it canvasses the sense of the ridiculous . It 's a globe-trotting tour of McCarthy 's talent , throughout which she 's practically always kicking butt . Who was that double-O-what's-his-face , anyway ? Melissa McCarthy is right up there with Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton Melissa McCarthy does n't just adopt guises to fool the bad guys in `` Spy . '' Part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts she pulls on the audience . Melissa McCarthy 's new star vehicle easily passes the Bechdel Test , and that 's a welcome relief during the summer blockbuster season . 	Simultaneously broad and progressive , Spy offers further proof that Melissa McCarthy and writer-director Paul Feig bring out the best in one another -- and delivers scores of belly laughs along the way .
maid in manhattan Succeeds where many others have failed ( Sweet Home Alabama being a recent example ) by actually being romantic and side-stepping tedium . The sad truth is that as a couple J . Lo and Mr. Fiennes fail to duplicate the movie-star charisma of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere . Funcionando ( ainda que rasteiramente ) como um romancezinho gua-com-acar , Encontro de Amor pode at ser um passatempo inofensivo , mas certamente voc encontrar opes melhores em sua locadora . The ending is so inspirational , it may just make you want to kill yourself . The car battery of romantic comedies : 'Carefully calibrated for maximum manipulative effect . ' A diverting trifle that will amuse you while it 's on the screen , then fade from memory while the final credits roll . So pick up a dust rag and tidy up your room -- you 'll have more of an engaging experience than being subject to this baseless , breezy hokum . Undeniably pleasing , if not particularly memorable . In the affable Maid in Manhattan , Jennifer Lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly A-list players . If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan . 	Too blandly generic , Maid in Manhattan also suffers from a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Fiennes .
jimmy neutron boy genius Put simply , Jimmy Neutron rocks . Awesome , wacky , originality is diluted mildly by a rote sci-fi wrap up . Otherwise , could have been one of the best films of the year . Still very fun ! The ultimate 'love your parents ' message is simple and obvious , but the film offers a lot of fun on the way to that end . The characters are comical and dynamic -- especially Jimmy , Carl and Sheen -- and the outer space scenes are no less than stellar . Jimmy Neutron is a fun computer animated movie and is a tolerable way to entertain kids for a couple of hours . Fun family film for the young and the young at heart . A mostly fun way to spend 77 minutes and , with its lovely candy-colored visuals , it looks good too . [ W ] hen they went into the outerspace adventure it just got so silly and it did n't really go anywhere and it just kind of lay dead there . Good news for you moms and dads out there who will undoubtedly be dragged by their kids to see this film -- it 's actually quite good ! More clever than we have any right to expect . 	What Jimmy Neutron lacks in computer animation , it makes up for in charm and cleverness .
les amours imaginaires Sumptuously photographed and elegantly stylised , Heartbeats ' exterior is as seductive as Schneider 's R-Pattzalike . Dig beneath the surface , though , and there ai n't much there . The film couples high comedy with spiritual solitude . That 's not just a slo-mo stunt , it 's a cockeyed triumph . `` Heartbeats '' charts its own course . Hipster 's delight . Too many musical interludes , too much posing , and generally not enough meat in the sandwich . `` Heartbeats '' looks good , and it has some funny dialogue . But there is n't enough to sustain the film 's running time . So much of the impact of Heartbeats is erotic because it always withholds sex or breaks it up into pieces . Xavier Dolan is the new darling of Canadian cinema , and it 's easy to see why . The vibe of the French-Canadian `` Heartbeats '' is better conveyed by its original title , which needs no translation : `` Les Amours Imaginaires . '' Ultimately , Dolan 's image-led central characters and their shallow , bitchy concerns wo n't appeal to everyone , but those who 've experienced l'amour fou themselves will find plenty to enjoy . 	An art film to the max , Heartbeats intriguing and appealing premise is sometimes buried by director Xavier Dolan 's filmmaking flourishes .
good luck chuck Alba manages to imbue the proceedings with a modest degree of charm , but the moment she exits the frame the movie stalls , unable to overcome the sheer blandness of its ostensible star . a blow-to-the-crotch , boobie-shot kind of comedy The ultimate low point comes during the closing credits , when Dane Cook 's Charlie performs bestial acts with a stuffed toy penguin . As if grapefruit used in the same way as American Pie 's apple pie is n't bad enough . Gross . Exactly what the target demographic wants and gets . Cross the street to avoid this one . Good Luck Chuck looks like the unscreenable bits of bad movies best forgotten retrieved from the cutting-room floor . If it was n't for the presence of leading lady Jessica Alba , Good Luck Chuck would be lucky to get even a DVD release . Somebody please stop Dane Cook before he becomes a movie star . It 's a sexed-up , dumbed-down Dr. T and the Women , with penguins to pacify women who 've been railroaded into going to this movie by their loutish boyfriends . If Wedding Crashers is in your top ten rom-coms ever , you might not hate this . Otherwise , it 's too gross to be sweet and too sweet to be gross . 	A shortage of laughs and an undercurrent of mean-spiritedness undermine Good Luck Chuck , squandering a decent premise on gross-out humor and shopworn slapstick .
1090759-deep blue sea For action-starved audiences suffering through a summer drought of flying glass and fiery explosions , this cheese barge may hit the spot . Bloody good fun for anyone seeking mindless summer distraction . A lumpy chowder of thrills , FX and camp . Despite scene after scene of mayhem , Harlin manages to create and and sustain extremely well-coiled tension . Renny Harlin 's pretty good when things happen fast and not much good when characters talk slow - or at all . Sharks for Dummies ! The repeated lifting of material from other films eventually sinks this one into mediocrity . This film was not what it could have or should have been , but it sure could have been a lot worse . A lame Jaws wannabe ! One of the few good `` Jaws '' ripoffs ... A thriller with some teeth . 	Aside from a few thrills , Deep Blue Sea is unoriginal and unintelligent .
unstoppable-2010 An adrenaline-infused runaway-train flick that perfectly distills director Tony Scott 's talents and limitations . A slam-bang winner . The screening room shook with Bill Kaplan 's awesome sound as the huge trains sped down the tracks . With its one-track premise , Unstoppable derails thrills . Some movies win you Oscars , and some have you playing second banana to an evil train -- and both have their place . The high-octane train sequences are staged with increasingly nail-biting tension , admirably shot without reverting to computer-generated trickery . Like a Big Mac , Unstoppable may not be that good for you , but it will probably leave a smile on your face . This is n't groundbreaking fare , mind you . But Unstoppable muscles through its story of peril with crafted intensity and a few well-placed grins . Given the linear , one-track nature of the plot , Scott and Bomback prove surprisingly effective at delivering a well-rounded experience , going out of their way to fill in the personalities of their two leads . The director of the limp `` Pelham 123 remake takes a second shot at his railway movie , and this time gets it right . It 's Washington 's Everyman who keeps the film honest . 	As fast , loud , and relentless as the train at the center of the story , Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment -- and director Tony Scott 's best movie in years .
source code I kind of love this movie . At a nicely paced 93 minutes , Source Code is hard to go along with at times but it 's an intriguing thriller that will hold your attention . 2011s action thriller to beat . A movie with an indie spirit and blockbuster sensibilities , Source Code is popcorn entertainment with genuine heft , and proof that the move to Tinseltown does n't always mean having to sell your soul to the suits . This is the dark side of Groundhog Day , where each visit to the past helps him learn things but inevitably leads to death . A taut , immersive ride . Whether you are a fan of science fiction or not , this is a great movie and is - ironically - the best offering in the genre since director Duncan Jones ' 2009 masterpiece Moon . Less introspective and ambitious than Jones ' first film , but it 's also more mainstream and accessible , in all the best ways . ... a well-crafted film on all levels . A time travel drama with a difference . 	Finding the human story amidst the action , director Duncan Jones and charming Jake Gyllenhaal craft a smart , satisfying sci-fi thriller .
13 assassins 2011 There are many deft touches , a sprinkling of humour and a great deal of grunting and shouting as men clash in hand to hand combat . But the supporting premise that this is a good fight to rid the world of an evil man gives the action moral traction 13 Assassins looks at honour from many angles , without becoming simplistic . Ichii has n't lost his edge after all . One suspects the slash-and-burn Miike of old might have scoffed at [ 13 Assassins ] . It shows that Takashi could be a great filmmaker if he 'd only slow down . Miike 's magnificent 13 mark both the end of an era and the boundary of a genre . Miike 's magisterial craftsmanship is beyond doubt as he sets up another complex study of violence and its implications . 13 Assassins may well be the most wholly accomplished and satisfying film to come our way all year . `` 13 Assassins '' is a must-see for Miike 's passionate legion of fans . But even action buffs who 've never seen any of his films before will be drawn in by this masterful exercise in cinematic butchery . What 's special about 13 Assassins is a 45-minute battle scene in which 13 heroic warriors take on the vastly superior army of a wickedly sadistic Shogun lord . The two halves of 13 Assassins are as finely balanced as one of the samurai swords from its grand , limb-lopping LOL-fest of a finale . 	Takashi Miike 's electric remake of Eiichi Kudo 's 1963 period action film is a wild spectacle executed with killer , dizzying panache .
